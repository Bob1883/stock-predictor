            "description": "(Yicai) Oct. 19 -- Seventeen Chinese companies listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, including liquor giant Kweichow Moutai and carmaker SAIC Motor, have attended a roadshow event organized by the Shanghai bourse to boost investor confidence.The firms, engaged in the food and beverage, electrical equipment, chemical, and automobile industries, have showcased their advantages, performance trends, and future plans with the aim of responding to China\u2019s call to activate capital, boost investor confidence, and promote investment, financing, and trading.Thirty other companies listed on the SSE are expected to carry out similar roadshow events in the future.Kweichow Moutai has reported an employee turnover rate of 0.03 percent last year, which is a core competitive advantage of Kweichow Moutai, Jiang Yan, chief financial officer, deputy general manager, and secretary of the board of the Zunyi-based company, said at the SSE event yesterday.Kweichow Moutai has dished out a total of CNY208.7 billion (USD28.5 billion) worth of dividends, equal to more than 50 percent of its net profits since listing in 2001, Jiang noted.As a traditional Chinese brand facing the new consumption trend, Kweichow Moutai must embrace the younger generation and persist in internationalization to maintain a young and robust performance, Jiang said about the company\u2019s cooperation with Luckin Coffee and Dove on liquor-flavored coffee and chocolates, respectively.\u201cBy 2025, half of SAIC Motor\u2019s total sales will be new energy vehicles and intelligent connected vehicles,\u201d the carmaker\u2019s Secretary-General Chen Xun said. \u201cMore than 20 percent of our sales will be overseas by then,\u201d Chen added, noting that the firm will also make breakthroughs in structural optimization.Supcon Technology, a Chinese supplier of intelligent manufacturing solutions for the processing industry, is actively seeking cooperation on high-end global products and technology suppliers, said Fang Yongsheng, the firm\u2019s vice president, secretary of the board of directors, and CFO.In the future, with the realization of China\u2019s carbon peak and carbon neutrality goals, new energy will continue to achieve strong growth, said Jiao Haihua, secretary of the board of directors of TBEA, a Chinese transformer manufacturer.Ultra-high voltage direct current will transmit new energy from suppliers to consumers, while the UHV alternating current ring network will balance the fluctuations brought by new energy power, meeting the demand for new power systems, Jiao noted.Editor: Futura Costaglione",

REUTERS/Tingshu Wang/File Photo Acquire Licensing RightsBEIJING, Oct 18 (Reuters) - U.S. coffee chain Starbucks (SBUX.O) has rolled out a new smaller cup size in China, its second largest market, in an aim to attract customers as competition in the country intensifies.Rolled out across its 6,500 stores on Tuesday, the 259ml cup is part of a new range the company calls \"Intenso Collection\", and can hold more espresso with less milk or cream, making it more intense than the larger cup. It costs 33 yuan ($4.51)It is nearly one third smaller than the 355ml \"tall\" cup for which prices start at 30 yuan, but bigger than the company's 236 ml smallest \"short\" size.Ben Cavender, managing director and head of strategy at China Market Research Group said Starbucks' new product is an effort to continue offering \"newness\" in the market to cater to serious coffee drinkers.\"These probably won't appeal to everyone but are a relatively easy line extension to implement,\" he said.The move comes as Starbucks' local rivals such as Luckin Coffee (LC0Ay.MU) and ByteDance-backed Manner Coffee have been expanding aggressively and rolling out new products at a faster pace.They have generated significant consumer buzz through collaborations such as Manner Coffee's tie up with French luxury house Louis Vuitton and Luckin's roll out of a liquor-infused latte with China's liquor maker Kweichow Moutai (600519.SS).A source familiar with the matter said the new cup size, a first for Starbucks China, was currently only available in mainland China and whether it will be offered abroad will depend on customer reception.In August, Starbucks said it was seeing a sharp recovery in China, as catering and tourism demand grew following the country's removal of COVID curbs. The company aims to reach a total of 9,000 stores across the country by 2025.($1 = 7.3120 Chinese yuan renminbi)Reporting by Sophie Yu, Brenda Goh, editing by Deborah KyvrikosaiosOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

At the meeting, Ding Xiongjun, the Chairman of Kweichow Moutai, announced that the company will establish an ESG Promotion Committee at the group level.\"Moutai will fully practice the ESG concept throughout all areas,\" Ding Xiongjun stated. He emphasized that modern enterprises should pursue value, which should encompass not only economic value but also ecological and social value. ESG is a system to evaluate whether a company is \"pursuing sustainable development,\" and, according to Ding, \"ESG is now a widely accepted concept.\" He stressed that apart from the group level, all subsidiaries should also follow the principle of \"implementing everything that should be implemented, and everything that can be implemented must be implemented.\" In his view, the publication of ESG reports is crucial for Kweichow Moutai's journey towards \"becoming a world-class company with a world-class brand.\" ESG principles should be integrated into all aspects of each company, including suppliers and distributors.Kweichow Moutai has published its \"ESG Report\" for two consecutive years and will continue to release it annually in the future.During the conference, Ding Xiongjun highlighted the bottle recycling initiative of Kweichow Moutai as a significant achievement for the year. It was reported that Guiding Jingqi Glass Bottle Factory started its first-phase furnace in March of this year and simultaneously initiated the Kweichow Moutai glass bottle recycling and reuse project. Ding Xiongjun explained that this process of bottle recycling is termed \"reverse logistics.\"The recycling of glass bottles helps Guiding Jingqi Glass Bottle Factory reduce energy consumption, resource usage, and pollution while improving product quality. It promotes the low-carbon, environmentally friendly, and energy-saving goals of the daily-use glass industry and serves as a reflection of Kweichow Moutai's commitment to the ESG philosophy.",

            "description": "The world of data-driven business is constantly evolving. Mohan Subramaniam, Professor of Strategy and Digital Transformation at IMD, illuminates the path from traditional, historical data to the dynamic realm of interactive data.We delve into the key takeaways from his address on India\u2019s digital transformation journey during his keynote at the India Management Transformation Summit last month in Mumbai, India.Data\u2019s evolution: From historic to interactiveOne of the paramount shifts is the move from episodic data (historical) to interactive data (real-time). Subramaniam started by drawing a clear distinction between the two. Historic data, often used to discern market trends and historical actions, has its place, but it falls short in today\u2019s fast-paced business environment. Interactive data, on the other hand, offers real-time insights gleaned from continuous interactions with products and services.The potential of interactive data for businesses lies in its ability to provide immediate insights into customer behavior and preferences. In doing so, it enables businesses to adapt swiftly to changing dynamics and make informed decisions.Delving into the customer connectionUnderstanding how individual customers are currently interacting with products and services has become very important in making business decisions. Rather than relying on aggregate data or generalized focus groups, Subramaniam advocates for a one-on-one understanding of each customer\u2019s real-time reactions. This personalized approach enables businesses to cater to individual needs and preferences, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty. Emphasizing the creativity and innovation that goes into this thinking, he added, \u201cIf you do that, it opens up new avenues for value creation.\u201dCompanies can generate revenue not only from product sales but also from data itself. Interactive data in particular becomes a valuable asset that can be monetized. This paradigm shift from product-centric to data-centric thinking opens up new avenues for value creation and business growth.Expanding beyond conventional boundariesBusinesses can transcend traditional value chains by integrating user data with complementary services and ecosystems, Subramaniam said. This expanded approach not only fosters innovation but also amplifies the value proposition for customers. It allows companies to offer more holistic and integrated solutions, enriching the customer experience.In the transition from product-based business models to data-driven ones, companies will inevitably encounter challenges. One such challenge is the mindset shift required to adapt to the impact of modern technology on data generation and sharing.",

            "description": "On the opening ceremony of the 3rd Belt and Road Summit being held in Beijing today, Chinese President Xi Jinping stated that China will lift all restrictions on foreign investment access in the manufacturing sector.According to China\u2019s latest document on the management of foreign investment access, there are now only two restrictions remaining: maintaining Chinese control over publications, and prohibiting foreign investment in certain processing techniques for traditional Chinese medicine and production of proprietary Chinese medicines with confidential prescriptions.Bai Ming, a researcher at the Research Institute of the Ministry of Commerce, commented that the lifting of restrictions on foreign investment access in the manufacturing sector gives out a strong signal that China\u2019s opening-up will continue to expand and improve. He pointed out that encouraging foreign investment in manufacturing is also beneficial for strengthening China\u2019s position in the global industrial supply chain as a \u201cmanufacture superpower\u201d.The \u201c2023 Statistical Bulletin on Foreign Investment in China\u201d shows that in 2022, China\u2019s absorption of foreign investment continued to grow steadily. The actual utilization of foreign investment reached $189.13 billion for the whole year, an increase of 4.5%. In terms of RMB, it exceeded 1.2 trillion yuan for the first time, with high-tech industries becoming important growth drivers. Investments from the European Union and ASEAN into China increased by 95.3% and 9.5% respectively. Additionally, according to data released by China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce, in the first six months of 2023, there were 24 thousand newly established foreign-invested enterprises in China, representing a growth rate of 35.7%.On September 27th, Sheng Qiuping, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Commerce stated at a press conference that currently, the so-called \u201cnegative list\u201d for foreign investment access in pilot free trade zones has achieved \u201czero restrictions\u201d in the manufacturing sector. The next step will focus on promoting openness in the service industry.Gao Ruidong, Chief Economist of Everbright Securities, recently stated at the China Macro Forum (CMF) that in response to the US\u2019s \u201crisk-off\u201d economic strategy, China should take three actions. Firstly, it should further reform and open up to become a defender of globalization. Secondly, it should focus on building a more resilient supply chain system. Thirdly, it should strive to expand total demand.\u201cForeign investors prioritize China\u2019s market, and then consider its business environment and cost advantages. If the overall demand is insufficient and prices are relatively low, China\u2019s attractiveness to foreign investors will systematically decline. By focusing on expanding total demand and ensuring economic growth remains at a certain level consistent with potential output, it will be beneficial for promoting continuous capital inflows from foreign investors as well as technology spillover effects,\u201d said Gao Ruidong.",

Gross profit increased 35% to GBP283,000 from GBP210,000.Executive Chair Don Goulding said he was \"pleased to report that the business has returned to growth\".This followed disappointing results for the year ended March 31, when revenue fell 55% to GBP1.3 million from GBP2.9 million, and gross profit plummeted to GBP684,000 from GBP1.6 million.Distil added that administrative costs increased 12% to GBP489,000 while cost of sales increased 40% to GBP349,000. The company also reduced investment in brand marketing and promotion by 58% to GBP159,000.Distil noted the \"business remodel\" undergone in the first half of 2022; Goulding said the first half of financial 2023 \"has enabled us to embrace the autonomy that [this] was designed to afford\".Additionally, Goulding commented: \"H1 has not been without its challenges, as the business continues to face wide-spread cost of goods increases in response to inflation and the war in Ukraine, as well as a UK duty increase on all alcoholic beverages.\"Reflecting the economic climate, consumers globally remain cautious, the impact of which is being felt in the trade and is expected to continue in the short to medium term.\"However, he said Distil was \"confident we will continue to build on promising wins within both the UK on-trade and export markets for the remainder of the year, demonstrating that we are successfully rebuilding from a stronger position.\"We head into our biggest trading period having implemented price premiumisation across the portfolio and as a result of this, coupled with the work of the operations team to reduce cost of goods, we anticipate that we will begin to recover margins.\"By Emma Curzon, Alliance News reporterComments and questions to newsroom@alliancenews.comCopyright 2023 Alliance News Ltd.

The migration has accelerated in recent years as U.S. tariffs push up costs for factories, and China\u2019s coastal megacities focus on high-tech electronics, electric vehicles and other advanced industries.The result has been an export boom for China\u2019s inland provinces that dwarfs the acceleration in overseas sales enjoyed by would-be rivals to China\u2019s manufacturing crown.As inland China develops further, it is helping China deepen its dominance in swaths of global manufacturing, even as Western nations grow wary of China as a supplier for critical industries such as semiconductors and renewable energy.China still faces major challenges in holding on to its top-dog status. Worsening demographics mean its manufacturing workforce is shrinking, and foreign investment in China is drying up.The U.S. and its allies are dangling subsidies and other incentives to persuade businesses to embrace alternatives to China, though a sizable shift in companies\u2019 sourcing is likely years away, economists say.\u201cChina is going to be a major player in global manufacturing for the foreseeable future,\" said Gordon Hanson, an economist and professor of urban policy at Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School, who explored the possibility of more manufacturing moving to inland China in a 2020 paper.\u201cChina just has too much capacity for the world not to need to rely on it for a good while.\"Since the start of 2018, exports from 15 of China\u2019s central and western provinces have rocketed 94% as factory production expanded beyond the Pearl and Yangtze River deltas that are the engine rooms of China\u2019s industrial economy.In the 12 months through August, those provinces exported a combined $630 billion\u2014more than India\u2019s $425 billion, Mexico\u2019s $590 billion, and Vietnam\u2019s $346 billion over the same period, according to official figures compiled by data provider CEIC.Exports from China\u2019s interior have been growing faster than those countries\u2019 exports, too, despite the surge in interest in alternative locations for manufacturing other than China.Since the beginning of 2018, exports from India have risen 41%, exports from Mexico have risen 43%, and exports from Vietnam have increased 56%. All three countries have benefited from the reshuffling of global supply chains in the wake of the U.S.-China trade war and the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2018, Mexico was exporting more than China\u2019s interior but was overtaken in 2020.China\u2019s coastal provinces, which encompass manufacturing hubs such as Guangzhou and Shenzhen in the south, Ningbo and Shanghai in the east and Qingdao and Tianjin in the northeast, remain the powerhouse of global manufacturing. Together, those regions exported $2.7 trillion of goods in the 12 months through August, around half the total exports of the U.S., European Union and Japan combined.A hunt for lower costsBehind the shift inland is a search for labor. In the 1990s and 2000s, millions of Chinese left the countryside to work in the factories sprouting in the coastal cities.Today, that trend is all but played out, and wages in coastal areas have risen sharply as companies jostle for staff.Average annual private-sector wages in Guangdong more than doubled in the 10 years through 2021, according to China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics. Better-educated younger workers in coastal cities are skipping tough factory work for jobs in services.View Full Image (WSJ)Ray Zhou, head of supply chains at Commerse, a fashion brand based in New York and China, said his company began shifting production to inland China from the coast in the second half of 2022.Now, about half of the machine sewing work is done by factories based in China\u2019s interior, including Guangxi and Hunan provinces. While producing garments inland means longer shipping times to the U.S., overall labor costs are about 30% cheaper than in Guangzhou, he said.Most workers hired by the factories that supply Commerse are in their 30s and 40s. \u201cYoung people would rather deliver takeout than be sewing clothes at factories,\" Zhou said.Other forces pushing companies into the interior include a search for cheaper factory space and tighter rules in coastal cities to reduce pollution or rezone industrial areas for residential development.Niche industries sometimes cluster in one place. A town in Anhui specializes in brushes, while one in Henan makes measuring tapes. In Guizhou, a mountainous province that also exports Kweichow Moutai, a fiery spirit, dozens of firms make high-quality guitars.Inland China\u2019s upsidesIn many ways, the shift in China mirrors the migration of industrial activity in the U.S. after World War II, when new highways and the advent of the shipping container enabled factories to move out of big cities in search of lower taxes and cheaper workers.Development of China\u2019s interior has been on Chinese leaders\u2019 minds since the 1960s, when Mao Zedong grew fearful of invasion by the Soviet Union from the north and the U.S. from south, where it was fighting in Vietnam. Authorities pushed to move basic industries such as power generation and steel and arms manufacturing into China\u2019s interior to protect them in the event of war.Beijing concluded in the 1980s that the effort was mostly a waste of resources. But Covell Meyskens, a historian of China and associate professor at the Naval Postgraduate School in California, said it laid foundations that nurtured industry later, such as the building of roads, schools and electricity grids.China\u2019s central planners have for decades emphasized the importance of creating an integrated national economy, said Meyskens. The interior \u201cisn\u2019t just treated as a rust belt you can completely abandon.\"Even today, the industries flourishing inland tend to be labor or resource-intensive or relatively low-value-added manufacturing, leaving China\u2019s coastal regions to concentrate on more advanced manufacturing.In Hubei, a central province with around 58 million residents, exports of heavy industry products such as chemicals, metals and vehicles more than doubled between 2018 and 2022, while exports from labor-intensive sectors such as clothes, furniture and toys rose 90%, according to Chinese customs data.View Full Image (WSJ)The landlocked province, which includes the city of Wuhan and the Three Gorges Dam, has many attractions for companies seeking a new base: Access to the coast and world beyond via roads, rail and rivers; universities focused on technology, science and business; and average private-sector wages that are 77% of the level in Guangdong.Garrett Motion, a maker of turbochargers, said in June it expanded production capacity at a plant in Wuhan by 50%. German auto parts maker Webasto has said it plans to establish a global research center in the city.Why China\u2019s grip is firmThe U.S. and other Western countries have grown uneasy about their dependency on China for manufactured goods, especially now that China isn\u2019t just providing cheap furniture and toys but is competing with Western manufacturers in sales of smartphones, machinery and, increasingly, autos.Washington and other capitals are offering subsidies to lure more manufacturing back home. They are also restricting China\u2019s access to Western technologies, such as semiconductors, that could have military applications.Many companies scarred by the pandemic and spooked by tensions between Beijing and the U.S.-led West arere fashioning supply chains to make them less reliant on China.But economists say loosening China\u2019s grip on global manufacturing will be tough.China\u2019s share of global goods exports was 14% in 2022, down slightly from 2021, and compared with 8.3% for the U.S. in second place and 6.6% for Germany, in third. A recent report by Rhodium Group, a New York-based research outfit, said moving factories out of China to other countries may have little impact on China\u2019s manufacturing clout, since those factories will remain dependent on Chinese suppliers for materials and components.\u201cIt would not be surprising to see China\u2019s overall share of global exports, manufacturing and supply chains continue to rise, even as diversification away from China accelerates,\" the authors said.View Full Image (WSJ)One advantage for China is its scale. As Japan, South Korea and other countries in East Asia industrialized during the 20th century, they quit manufacturing products such as textiles or furniture to concentrate limited factory capacity on higher-end products, such as cars and consumer electronics.China, by contrast, has maintained a stranglehold in manufacturing all sorts of goods, a testament to its factories\u2019 ability to keep down overall costs even as average wages of Chinese workers have risen.\u201cIt\u2019s not really going anywhere. It is producing everything from semiconductors to your shoes and your garments,\" said Louise Loo, lead economist for China at Oxford Economics.Chinese factories also benefit from cheap loans from domestic banks and a deep bench of suppliers of almost every conceivable component and raw material. Logistics costs in China are a fraction of the cost in India, for example, which can\u2019t match Chinese port and road infrastructure.All that means up-and-coming manufacturing nations such as Vietnam, India and Bangladesh face sizable challenges in competing with China, economists say.\u201cMy concern is very much about the newcomers,\" said Stefan Angrick, senior economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics in Tokyo. \u201cHow do you compete with that?\"Stella Yifan Xie in Hong Kong contributed to this article.Write to Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com",

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and the dividend capture strategy, and go directly to read 5 Best October Dividend Stocks To Buy.Dividend payments around the world have been growing significantly because investors are increasingly interested in income-generating assets. This strong reputation of dividend stocks didn't happen overnight; it's based on historical data that demonstrates how these stocks have consistently performed better than other types of investments over the years. Companies that regularly increase their dividends are particularly attractive in this scenario. They are considered real winners because they not only garner appreciation from investors but also thrive in changing market conditions. According to a report by Morgan Stanley, dividends are a crucial investment for long-term investors. Stocks with high dividends typically do well when inflation is higher than usual but on a downward trend. These stocks are also considered safe and become even more appealing during uncertain economic times because they provide stability and reliable income.As mentioned above, global dividends have experienced significant growth this year. China's largest companies have paid out 1.5 trillion yuan ($206 billion) in dividends this year, which has already exceeded the 1.27 trillion yuan paid out in 2022, according to a report by Bloomberg. The major contributors to this increase are the largest state-owned banks, with PetroChina and Kweichow Moutai following closely behind. Similarly, Janus Henderson reported that 98% of US companies either increased their dividends or maintained them at the same level in the second quarter of 2023. This percentage is significantly higher than the global average.Dividend investing can be a sound strategy for long-term investors. Holding onto stocks with consistently increasing dividends can lead to higher yields on original investment over time. Regular dividend hikes often contribute to an increase in the stock's share price. According to a recent report by T. Rowe Price, between the end of 1985 to the close of 2022, dividend growers in the Russell 1000 Index performed better than the broader benchmark index. Furthermore, these dividend-growing stocks showed lower levels of price fluctuations or volatility. Some of the best dividend stocks in this regard are The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) as these firms have consistently increased their dividend payments for many years.Story continuesIn addition to long-term investors, dividend investing can be appealing to some short-term investors through a dividend capture strategy. It involves purchasing a stock just before it goes ex-dividend and then selling it shortly thereafter, typically after the dividend is received. This strategy aims to capture the dividend income while minimizing exposure to the stock's price fluctuations.

            "description": "Asia is in the midst of a historic e-commerce boom. Online transactions of goods and services grew rapidly during COVID-19 lockdowns and continue to grow. Record numbers of Asian businesses are now selling online, reaching customers across borders. Perhaps unsurprisingly, China remains the region\u2019s largest business-to-consumer e-commerce market, making up about a third of global online retail sales in goods. But Southeast Asian e-commerce has been growing at a blistering 24% year on year in 2020-23 and, in 2022, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam ranked among the fastest-growing e-commerce markets in the world.Despite these impressive growth rates, Asian governments still have much work ahead of them to translate the region\u2019s swift adoption of e-commerce into inclusive digital trade opportunities for more local firms, especially small businesses. This will require a deeper integration of markets, the implementation of international commitments on trade and data, and the improved cross-border interoperability of digital payments and platforms.Integration through trade agreementsGovernments in the region have long sought to facilitate regional e-commerce through broad-brush arrangements such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), alongside more advanced free trade agreements that unite regional economies with international partners to promote digital trade \u2013 for example, the US-Japan Digital Trade Agreement and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). The adoption of the policies and practices in these agreements are conducive to digital trade infrastructural needs, from e-payment laws and export promotion programs to financing for online small and medium-sized enterprises. They have, therefore, all bolstered the e-commerce surge.Yet despite the many digital trade agreements in force, Asian businesses continue to struggle with diverse national digital trade policy frameworks. According to Nextrade Group research for the US Agency for International Development, (USAID), more than one-third of Southeast Asian sellers say they are struggling with the region\u2019s fragmented digital regulatory landscape. The complexity of overlapping or contradictory national data privacy laws, consumer protection rules, and other regulations can be daunting enough in one market, let alone across multiple markets. Firms also worry about potential data localization \u2013 where local authorities require data to be stored in the country \u2013 undermining cross-border e-commerce. This practice hampers the hundreds of thousands of small online seller-exporters that use data about their foreign customers and operations to improve their products and services and want to leverage global cloud providers to store and process their data where most affordable and convenient.These obstacles and concerns point to the clear need for an alignment of the regional policy agenda to promote digital trade. In short, there needs to be further interoperability across national digital regulations in particular to facilitate greater compliance among smaller firms. More regional signatories to the CPTPP and other trade agreements with binding e-commerce rules, for example, could help to foster this convergence and lock each participating economy into standardized rules for digital trade. The intention of ASEAN economies to negotiate a Digital Economy Framework Agreement (DEFA) is a potential positive step towards more robust and binding rules that promote e-commerce, promote digital interoperability, and create a more level playing field.",

Then, a liquor latte that sold more than five million cups on its first day.Last weekend, in a collaboration with chocolate brand Dove, China\u2019s top baijiu brand Kweichow Moutai launched alcohol-infused chocolate truffles that were snapped up online within seconds.More commonly associated with state banquets and business meals, Kweichow Moutai \u2013 China\u2019s second-most valuable company by market valuation \u2013 is on a quest to make itself more accessible to a younger crowd.Likewise, other makers of baijiu, China\u2019s national liquor, are also toasting fun ways to cultivate new customers.A fiery grain liquor that is 53 per cent alcohol, Moutai was known to be the favourite drink of Chairman Mao Zedong, who famously used it to welcome then United States President Richard Nixon on his historic trip to China in 1972.Current Chinese President Xi Jinping also used it to toast his American counterpart Barack Obama in 2013.Largely associated with male and older drinkers, the brand \u2013 renowned for its \u201csauce\u201d fragrance \u2013 found it hard to attract younger consumers, but this changed with the launch of its baijiu ice cream in 2022.Now, consumers can readily buy a cup of baijiu, plum liquor or boozy vanilla ice cream for 59 yuan (S$11), a far cry from the 2,500 yuan for a bottle of Flying Fairy, Moutai\u2019s signature line.Like wine and scotch, aged bottles of Moutai can cost up to 300,000 yuan.\u201cI bought the original baijiu-flavoured ice cream out of curiosity because everyone was talking about it and it looks quite cute in a retro way,\u201d said designer Sonya Fu, 28.Other than regular cups with the Moutai branding, the ice cream is also available in a cup shaped like a tiny baijiu bottle, or as a popsicle.Curiosity also led her to splurge on a bottle of Moutai to share with her friends, whose interest in the typical old man\u2019s drink was similarly piqued after first trying the ice cream.Now, she and her friends are eager to try Moutai coffee and chocolates as well.\u201cI suppose since it\u2019s a local brand that\u2019s trying to innovate, why not support it?\u201d she told The Straits Times.Kweichow Moutai, which originated in the town of Maotai in south-western Guizhou province, had taken a hit in 2013 when Mr Xi launched an anti-corruption drive. Under the campaign, any sign of excesses among officials, including expensive liquor at state banquets, had to be stamped out.The campaign led to \u201cunprecedented pressure\u201d on the alcohol industry, Moutai noted in an earnings report that year. Its sales grew by only around 17 per cent, a steep drop from 44 per cent the previous year. By 2014, this plunged to about 2 per cent.Moutai has since bounced back due to a combination of the brand\u2019s enduring appeal and efforts to market directly to the consumer, and now has a market value of US$315 billion (S$430 billion), just behind Internet behemoth Tencent. In 2022, it reported business revenue of 124 billion yuan, a nearly 17 per cent increase from the previous year.",

Among these mentions, approximately 18.9% express a positive sentiment, while 7.3% express a negative sentiment.Charles Cheung, CARMA\u2019s HK GM said some netizens have applauded the promotional strategy employed in the collaboration between Dove and Kweichow Moutai.Given Dove's established international brand presence, the partnership is viewed as an opportunity for Kweichow Moutai to enhance its brand recognition in the global market, even if the chocolates themselves may not generate significant sales.Meanwhile, social monitoring firm Meltwater saw a total of 88.3k mentions regarding the collab, with 49.9% positive, 42.6% neutral and 7.5% negative sentiments. Keywords associated with the alcoholic chocolates include \u201crepost\u201d, \u201cbrands\u201d, \u201cprice\u201d, \u201ccholocates\u201d, \u201clooking forward\u201d.The \u201cMoutai phenomenon\u201dFounded in 1999, Kweichow Moutai is a historic Chinese spirit brand specialising in the production of the spirit Moutai baijiu, which contains 53% alcohol. Love it or hate it, the latest Moutai-inspired products, from alcoholic-infused latte to branded chocolates and mooncakes, are gaining momentum.Explaining on the \u201cMoutai phenomenon\u201d, industry players MARKETING-INTERACTIVE spoke to believed that this is a strategic move of Moutai to tap into Gen Z consumers, who are less into drinking traditional Chinese spirit like the older generations.Brian Yeung, co-founder, Brandstorm Communications said what Gen Zs spend on and subsequently what they post on social media are part of the way they express their individuality.\"Innovative brand partnership and crossover of products such as Moutai alcohol-infused products are such a draw because Gen Z sees buying them as a way to show their creative spirit on social media,\" he added.The unique collaboration between these two super-brands indeed proved to be an instant hit. Arthur R. Hagopian, senior director, global strategy/digital, SPRG Beijing, said while Kweichow Moutai is generally celebrated by older generations, the combination of this product with coffee, the beverage of choice for younger generations was captivating and alluring to young consumers.\"It also suggests that the \u201cguochao\u201d trend (referring to China \u201cwaves\u201d or \u201cfashion\u201d), along with nostalgia marketing (evoking emotions of a bygone era) continue to be extremely effective strategies to engage younger millennial and Gen Z consumers in China,\" he said.Agreeing with Hagopian was Rudi Leung, director and founder, Hungry Digital, who said as an old-fashioned brand, Moutai is not typically associated with mass products that young consumers would consume.\"By using ingredient marketing, Moutai can tap into other categories and reach different audience segments, such as the younger group. This approach can help the brand penetrate new markets and increase its customer base in the long run,\" he said.In the perpetual search for novelty and surprise in social media, brands are emboldened to experiment and enter counterintuitive segments with individual campaigns. David Ko, managing director, RFI Asia, said by partnering with Moutai, Luckin Coffee and Dove chocolate can enhance their brand image and reputation, as well as increasing their sales and profits.With the new collab, Moutai can attract more young and female consumers, who may not be familiar with or fond of its liquor. \u201cThe collab can also create a positive and fun association with Moutai, which may otherwise be seen as a serious and formal drink,\u201d he added.Is this win-win collaboration for Moutai and partnering brands?In fact, co-branding is not new and it can be quite a common tactic used between high-end brands and fast-moving consumer goods brands. Back in February this year, Nike and Tiffany & Co.\u2019s surprise collab made waves on social media back in February. The co-branded merchandise drew plenty of positive comments and a check by MARKETING-INTERACTIVE revealed that many consumers were excited to see the final product.Don't miss: Love it or hate it: Do you think the Nike X Tiffany & Co. partnership makes sense?Most recently, Moutai joined forces with Luckin coffee to produce a Moutai-flavoured latte, which is made with a liquour-flavoured milk that contains Kweichow Moutai. The level of alcohol in the beverage is less than 0.5%, making it easier for youngsters to try it for the first time.Co-branding can be a marketing tactic to generate new excitement to engage with a wider audience nowadays. Celine Cheung, account director, RSVP Communications said this Moutai x Dove collab is a kind of joy promotion, and it has evolved from offering discounts upon product purchases to enhancing consumer experiences.\"Consumers are looking for new excitements nowadays. Apart from new tools leveraged in campaigns, consumers also look at whether the product is attractive enough. It is brave for a historic brand to collaborate with different brands to offer new consumer experiences,\" she added.These types of exciting and innovative collaborations are vital for \u201ctraditional\u201d brands in China to tap into millennial and Gen Z audiences, who have increased spending power\u2014 and are keen to experience (and pay for) unique product experiences that are culturally relevant, said SPRG Beijing\u2019s Hagopian.\"Creating this type of buzz also contributes to a valuable curiosity and FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) effect\u2014 as many young consumers ran to try the recent collaboration after seeing all their friends posting about it on their WeChat friend circles,\" he added.He added that brands that fully understand consumer dispositions and embrace innovative strategies for emotional engagement will succeed among this increasingly vital youth segment.On the creative front, Kenneth Wan, director, The Bread Digital, said these moves not only help the brands to expand their client repertoire, but this also helps to project an approachable, modern and innovative brand image.\"These will help to promote their wider range of product portfolio. Next challenge (a happy one) for Moutai will be how to make good use of the demand generated,\" he said.In this instance, products such as coffee and chocolate are appealing to young consumers and so, for brands in this space, co-branding is quick way to engage with this group, according to Stella He, director, TEAM LEWIS Beijing.However, for high-end brands such as Moutai, it remains a question whether it will benefit from these collabs in terms of its effectiveness to convert young consumers into consumers of their own.\"What brands may not realise is that depending on this tactic may cause it to lose its novelty and eventually, the influence it has over consumers,\" she added.Related articles:Not the right time for the Swatch X Blancpain collab?Newest installation of Levi's x NewJeans collaboration drops",

            "description": "A few years before integrated casino resorts became popular in the Philippines, there was already what was then called Resorts World Manila\u2014a joint venture project of Megaworld (later Alliance Global Group) and the foreign Genting Group.But with the exit of the latter from the business, the father-and-son team of Andrew and Kevin Tan decided to transform the sprawling development in Pasay City into a more attractive undertaking, starting with the project\u2019s recent rebranding into \u201cNewport World Resorts.\u201dKevin, in particular, spends a substantial part of his productive hours nowadays reimagining Newport World into a new development, inside and out.ADVERTISEMENTAnd one key component of this transformed venue is the younger Tan\u2019s very own pet project dubbed The Whisky Library, described as \u201ca haven of luxury hosting the largest collection of whisky in Manila along with cosmopolitan liquors that taste of its global origins.\u201dThat may sound like marketing exaggeration but seeing its insides gives credence to this claim. That\u2019s because The Whisky Library is home to over 240 selected fine aged Scottish and international single malt whiskies from leading producers worth over\u2014brace yourselves\u2014P100 million.Specifically, there are over a dozen types of distilled spirits from whisky, rum, cognac, tequila and mezcal, vodka, gin, Moutai and various liqueurs, and contained in 670 bottles on display at the bar. That\u2019s quite a sizable collection, and a pricey one, at that.ADVERTISEMENTBiz Buzz recently got a glimpse of the collection\u2019s highlights which include the Dalmore Constellation series (exclusive to The Whisky Library); the Dalmore Constellation series of 1971 (P3.4 million); Glenrothes 8-year-old MacPhail\u2019s Collection from the HighlandPark Distillery single malt Scotch whisky; Mars Komagatake 2020 limited edition single malt Japanese whisky; 30-year-old Kweichow Moutai Baijiu (P465,920); Clase Azul Tequila Ultra (P380,000), and even Brockmans Gin (P13,000).But Biz Buzz hears that the transformation of Newport World Resorts has just started because, in a few weeks time, the brand will be announcing a new restaurant concept owned by a foreign celebrity chef that will soon open for the first time in the Philippines.

            "description": "Multinational and regional caf\u00e9 chains have rapidly proliferated across Mainland China over the last two decades. As the top-tier cities become saturated, more caf\u00e9 chain operators, including Luckin Coffee and Starbucks, are expanding into smaller towns. However, intensifying competition is accelerating product innovation and triggering price wars among these operators. As per-outlet revenues are squeezed, the expansion spree will taper off. Following double-digit growth over 2017\u201322, the number of coffee & tea shop outlets in China will thereby inch up at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1.4% over 2023\u201327*, according to GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company.Kiki Wu, China Senior Business Development Manager at GlobalData China, comments: \u201cLuckin Coffee, a domestic food tech company, stole the lead from global giant Starbucks China, opening its milestone 10,000th outlet in China in mid-2023. Starbucks China is hot on the trail, striving to expand its network to 9,000 stores by 2025. Besides the two market leaders, a host of local and international dine-in, takeaway, and delivery chain operators, including Hey Tea, Coffee Box, Pacific Coffee, and Manner Coffee, are expanding their footprint in China.\u201cWith Beijing and Shanghai being packed with coffee and tea shops and rental costs surging, operators are spreading their roots into smaller cities and towns. Caf\u00e9 operators also face competition from direct-to-consumer brands, such as Saturnbird Coffee and Yongpu Coffee; convenience store brands, such as Convenience Bee Coffee, Family Mart Coffee, K-Coffee, and 7/11 Coffee; and vending machines dispensing ready-to-drink coffees.\u201dBobby Verghese, Consumer Analyst at GlobalData, notes: \u201cThe intense competition is stimulating product innovation. Local operators are more agile, responding rapidly to changing consumer preferences. For instance, through a partnership with domestic beverages giant Kweichow Moutai, Luckin Coffee launched The Moutai Latte, a low-alcohol latte infused with Moutai baiju, an iconic local spirit. Millions of cups of Moutai Latte were sold at its launch, and the drink attained viral popularity on social media sites. Such unique offerings are designed to attract 50% of Chinese consumers whose product and service choices are often or always influenced by how enjoyable or unique the product/service is**. Not to be left behind, Starbucks recently opened its China Coffee Innovation Park at a cost of $220 million to digitize its supply chain and accelerate its sustainability initiatives in China.\u201dWu adds: \u201cUnder rising competitive pressure, domestic operators are also rolling out special discounts and price promotions to expand their consumer base. Though inflation has not been a concern for China as it has in the rest of Asia-Pacific, such budget-price offerings are gaining appeal among Chinese consumers in light of the economic slowdown. This ties in with GlobaData\u2019s consumer survey finding, wherein 42% of Chinese respondents say their spending on coffee & tea shops is quite/very high**. However, a long-term price war can take a toll on operators\u2019 revenue and profit margins, particularly for large-scale caf\u00e9 operators, whose unique selling point lies in their premium dine-in experience.\u201dVerghese concludes: \u201cThe increasing availability of high-quality domestically cultivated coffee from the Yunan Province will aid operators in lowering their product costs. Additionally, the rising demand from outlets in smaller cities will boost volume sales. However, these cities\u2019 lower household disposable incomes will suppress operators\u2019 pricing power. In this scenario, operators can apply the brakes on network expansion and consolidate revenues. For instance, in 2021, the Yum China and Lavazza partnership targeted 1,000 stores by 2025. However, the pace of new outlet openings has slowed, with the joint venture operating under 100 stores even as late as September 2023. Other operators can also follow suit and hold off on their ambitious expansion plans for the time being.\u201d*GlobalData Consumer Intelligence Center \u2013 Market Analyzers, accessed in September 2023**GlobalData 2023 Q2 Consumer Survey \u2013 China, with 716 respondents, published in May 2023",

            "description": "\u201cFast\u201d has always been a label attached to Luckin Coffee. In the second quarter of this year, the Chinese coffee company\u2019s total revenue reached RMB 6.2 billion (USD 848.7 million), competing head to head with Starbucks China, which racked up RMB 5.9 billion (USD 807.6 million) in net income for the same quarter. It\u2019s worth noting that Starbucks has been cultivating the coffee market for over 24 years, while Luckin Coffee opened its first store less than six years ago.As of the end of this year\u2019s second quarter, the total number of stores operated by Luckin Coffee reached 10,836, officially entering the five-figure range. Only four other Chinese food-related brands have accomplished this feat, including:Mixue Bingcheng, an ice cream and tea store chain.Juewei Food, a braised product chain specializing in duck products.Zhengxin Food Group, a diversified food conglomerate.Wallace, a Fujian-headquartered fast food chain.Prior to Luckin Coffee, the fastest brand to establish 10,000 stores was Zhengxin Food Group, which took around 11 years.Last year, however, a fierce competitor unexpectedly emerged in the coffee industry: Cotti Coffee. In the span of less than a year, Cotti Coffee has established over 5,000 stores nationwide, which seems miraculous but also controversial.Cotti Coffee\u2019s fast-paced growthA conspicuous feature of Cotti Coffee is its connection to Luckin Coffee. This can be attributed to Cotti Coffee\u2019s founding team, comprising Lu Zhengyao and Qian Zhiya, former chairman and former CEO of Luckin Coffee respectively. Both Lu and Qian left Luckin Coffee following the company\u2019s financial scandal in 2020. Thus, it\u2019s not surprising that Cotti Coffee\u2019s \u201cLuckin genes\u201d are apparent.One aspect is store location, which aligns closely with Luckin Coffee\u2019s. Cotti Coffee\u2019s stores are generally small-scale, resembling Luckin Coffee\u2019s pick-up stores. In terms of franchising, Cotti Coffee also adopted the same cooperative model by collecting service fees based on gross and operating profit instead of charging franchising fees. According to Bohu Finance, Cotti Coffee\u2019s business development team has emphasized to external parties that the company\u2019s founders and team are from the original Luckin Coffee team, and that the products, supply chain, and business model are identical to Luckin Coffee\u2019s. These claims are unfounded in reality, as both companies are unrelated.Another aspect is burn rate. On one hand, Cotti Coffee invests heavily in marketing. For example, it partnered with Argentina\u2019s national football team last year to launch a series of co-branded World Cup products. This helped the company gain significant exposure following Argentina\u2019s victory in Qatar.On the other hand, Cotti Coffee uses low prices to drive growth. In February this year, it initiated a two-month \u201cCoffee Carnival\u201d campaign, pricing over 70 of its products at prices as low as RMB 9.9 per cup. Similar campaigns followed suit starting May this year, including the \u201cSummer Iced Drinks Season, 9.9 Yuan Everyday\u201d marketing campaign and the \u201c8.8 Yuan For Any Purchase\u201d Douyin campaign. Cotti Coffee has also been launching a variety of growth activities, including programs that allow customers to drink coffee for free in exchange for bringing in new customers.The results have been evident. The \u201cCoffee Carnival\u201d campaign helped sell over 1.53 million cups of coffee within two weeks, and in less than a year, Cotti Coffee has opened over 5,000 stores and even expanded its operations overseas.Luckin Coffee responded by introducing a RMB 9.9 coupon in May this year, and subsequently initiated a regular RMB 9.9 weekly promotion a month later. In August, Luckin Coffee chairman Guo Jin announced during an earnings conference that the RMB 9.9 promotion would be extended to last for at least two years. Luckin Coffee\u2019s sales grew massively afterward, especially for popular products such as an alcohol-infused latte that was collaboratively developed with Chinese state-owned alcohol producer Kweichow Moutai. The first-day sales volume of that product exceeded 5.42 million cups, earning over RMB 1 billion in revenue.Whether Cotti Coffee can stay competitive in the coming years remains unknown, but some of Cotti Coffee\u2019s franchisees have started to break even.The other side of the coinAccording to Luckin Coffee\u2019s semi-annual report, the number of its paying customers for the second quarter of this year reached 43.1 million after it introduced the RMB 9.9 coupon, representing a 107.9% year-on-year increase. At the same time, the company\u2019s general and rental expenses decreased by 3.5% and 1.6% respectively, demonstrating an overall improvement in operational efficiency. By combining its scale (of over 10,000 stores) with its digital operational capabilities, Luckin Coffee can still make a profit selling each cup of coffee at RMB 9.9.Cotti Coffee\u2019s situation, however, seems less optimistic.Firstly, sales have significantly declined, especially after Cotti Coffee began to raise its prices. In July, Cotti Coffee changed the terms of its Douyin group-buying coupon, raising the promotional price in increments from RMB 9.9 per cup of coffee to RMB 13.5, RMB 14.9, and so on. The following month, it discontinued the \u201c9.9 Yuan Everyday\u201d promotion, and also removed the RMB 8.8 store-exclusive coupon. The discounted price of RMB 8.8 subsequently applied only to its coconut milk latte product.With Cotti Coffee frequently raising its prices, its franchisees have started to comment on social media platforms like Xiaohongshu and Douyin about the significant decline in sales they have started to experience. Bohu Finance quoted a Cotti Coffee employee who stated that the daily sales volume of a Cotti Coffee outlet in a second-tier city is only 200 cups. Some netizens even shared that some Cotti Coffee stores closed after just one month of operation after spending three months to complete renovations.Increasing its prices has made Cotti Coffee less appealing to consumers, and by extension, franchisees. The main factor that enabled Cotti Coffee to open so many stores within a short span of time has been the efforts of its large pool of franchisees. So how long can Cotti Coffee, which relies heavily on its franchisees, sustain itself?A report by 36Kr states that Cotti Coffee\u2019s fast-paced expansion isn\u2019t a proactive strategy of the company, but a reflection of \u201cmarket demand.\u201d According to a survey conducted by a coffee industry experts, there are three main groups of franchisees who joined Cotti Coffee:The first group consists of those who were previously part of Luckin Coffee and made money through Luckin Coffee\u2019s franchising model. They joined Cotti Coffee after Luckin Coffee tightened its franchising policy.The second group includes franchising novices who want to start a business but are unsure of what to do. They joined Cotti Coffee after being attracted by its investment and promotional activities.The third group falls somewhere in between the first two. It comprises franchisees who believe Cotti Coffee has a shot at success since its core team has been successful before and hold a significant track record.However, according to a report by Amber Consumer Research Society, statistics for June and July 2023 show that most of the 20-odd stores in the city of Linyi are experiencing a decline in sales.The RMB 8.8 strategy proves unprofitable for Cotti Coffee, leaving franchisees waiting for a return on investment. At \u201cnormal prices\u201d, Cotti Coffee is struggling to increase its sales, making losses harder for franchisees to stomach.Furthermore, Cotti Coffee is also frequently facing supply chain issues related to product quality control, facilities, among others. Several media reports have indicated that Cotti Coffee\u2019s stores utilize a variety of coffee machines, lacking consistency in brand and model. Franchisees have also complained about Cotti Coffee\u2019s erratic delivery schedules, which have affected their businesses. According to a netizen who posted on Xiaohongshu (also internationally known as Red), a Cotti Coffee product was unavailable for over a week at a store because there was no stock in the company\u2019s warehouse at all.Meanwhile, Cotti Coffee franchisees need to stave off not only intense market competition, but also internal pressures driven by the company\u2019s pursuit of rapid, large-scale growth. Some franchisees have expressed that shortly after they opened their stores, new Cotti Coffee outlets emerged within a one-kilometer radius.These issues have led to a growing chorus of pessimism about Cotti Coffee in the market, suggesting that the company has much to do if it hopes to remedy the situation.Plenty of homework to be doneCoupling low prices with rapid store expansion is not a completely new business strategy\u2014it was something attempted by other players in the past, including Mixue Bingcheng and Luckin Coffee. However, these companies have the edge of being benchmarks in their respective markets. Under the glamor of operating over ten thousand stores, Mixue Bingcheng has built an effective supply chain, while Luckin Coffee has innovated to develop unique products and digitalized its business operations.So, what Cotti Coffee needs to figure out urgently is not how to become the next Luckin Coffee, but to discover an identity that fits what Cotti Coffee is (or was meant to be).On this point, perhaps looking at recent tea trends can offer some valuable insights.Heytea leveraged new media effectively, turning it into a form of social currency by creating scenes where customers have to wait hours before they can get their hands on a cup of tea. At the same time, it capitalized on shifts in consumer preferences, abandoning slightly lower-priced ingredients used in traditional media tea and opting for high quality tea, cheese, and milk, positioning its brand more effectively.Naixue (formerly known as Nayuki), with its large-scale stores and high-end product concept that amalgamates milk tea with European pastries, became the first publicly listed milk tea brand. Shanghai\u2019s Auntea Jenny tapped into the growing demand for healthier options among the younger generation by focusing on fresh fruit teas, carving out a sizable spot for itself in the market. The Alley successfully broke into the market by adopting a \u201ctea plus milk tea\u201d approach, becoming the top dog for several years. New tea drinks are booming, and brands are staking their claim by developing and showcasing their unique selling points.In the case of Cotti Coffee, while it managed to attract customers quickly through low and subsidized prices, it\u2019s ultimately not a long-term solution.Leaving aside other factors, competing solely based on price pits it not only against strong competitors like Luckin Coffee, but also a steady stream of emerging companies selling ultra-low-priced coffee. For example, even in Shanghai where rent is steep, Cubic3 is selling premium coffee for prices as low as RMB 5 per cup (the original price is RMB 10, but only RMB 5 is chargeable if customers bring their own cup).Cotti Coffee\u2019s current low-price business model doesn\u2019t have much appeal, and it\u2019s hard to say how long its franchisees will continue to support it.To survive in this increasing competitive market, Cotti Coffee needs to develop its unique way of standing out while addressing issues with its supply chain and operational capabilities.It\u2019s worthwhile to note that this problem doesn\u2019t apply solely to Cotti Coffee. Even Luckin Coffee lacks the branding it needs to avoid entering a price war. Otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t have needed to resort to launching a regular RMB 9.9 promotion.The key difference in circumstance between Luckin Coffee and Cotti Coffee is that the former still has time to adjust and grow. On the contrary, Cotti Coffee needs to adapt quickly. China\u2019s coffee market is already highly saturated in its first- and second-tier cities. From the perspective of companies hoping to contend for market share in third- and fourth-tier cities, there\u2019s no time to wait anymore.This article was adapted based on a feature originally written by and published on Bohu Finance (WeChat ID: bohuFN).

The product was an instant hit and was sold out within minutes after it was put on sale at the online store.As of Monday morning, the chocolate remains unavailable on Kweichow Moutai's official online store.On Chinese e-commerce platform Pinduoduo.com, dealers added markup for the trending chocolate. For example, the official pricing of the sugar-reduced chocolate was set at 39 yuan per box of 2 pcs (20g), but it was selling at 98 yuan per box on a Pinduoduo.com store, an increase of 151 percent in prices.To date, more than 10,000 consumers have applied to purchase the co-branded chocolate at the official Moutai online store on JD.com, with the 12-piece chocolate box being the most popular, while more than 4,200 people have made reservations for tomorrow's rush.Chocolate is more of a gift attribute than a daily food choice. And, considering the price of Moutai chocolate, most consumers might use them as gifts for special days, Zhu Danpeng, a veteran food industry analyst said on Thursday before the chocolate hit online store.Given Moutai's strong presence in the Chinese liquor market and Dove's long standing prestige among Chinese consumers, the co-branded baijiu-infused chocolate attracted consumers' attention before it hit the market. A hashtag linked to the collaboration of the two brands reached top of the trending topics list on Weibo with over 150 million views and 120 million discussions after it was released on Thursday.The co-branded chocolate product is another attempt by Moutai to get closer to young consumers, and taking into account of Dove's brand reputation overseas, Moutai could leverage this collaboration to promote Chinese baijiu to the international market, said Zhu.In early 2023, another Chinese liquor maker Fenjiu Group made a co-branded baijiu chocolate product with Danish chocolate company Anthon Berg. The Danish chocolate maker also had cooperated with another Chinese liquor company YangHe Group to produce alcohol-infused chocolates during the 4th CIIE in Shanghai.The hot-selling co-branded chocolate marks Moutai's success in its attempt to win over young consumers after launching baijiu-infused latte and ice cream. Luckin Coffee, Moutai's cobranding partner announced on September 5 that the brand's Jiangxiang Latte had sold 5.42 million cups on its first day of release.",

The stores were hurrying to restock, with a reduced sugar version also on its way to the hypermarket chain's 26 locations in the city.Each chocolate weighs 10 grams and contains 2 grams of Kweichow Moutai's baijiu, which is 53 percent alcohol by volume. Baijiu is a traditional Chinese fiery liquor made from sorghum and grains such as wheat, barley, or rice.Baijiu makers are taking steps to attract more young consumers as alcohol preferences undergo a generational shift in China. Co-branding became a trend in 2016 when baijiu distiller Luzhou Laojiao came out with liquor-infused chocolate, ice cream, milk tea, and perfume, with the last becoming a smash hit.The baijiu-laced lattes that Kweichow Moutai and Luckin Coffee debuted on Sept. 4 also quickly ran out. The product was gradually restocked at some of Luckin\u2019s cafes in China on Sept. 10, with nationwide supplies to resume tomorrow, the Xiamen-based firm said on Sept. 11.Ice cream, coffee, and chocolate have added to the ways that baijiu can be consumed, but not all liquor brands are suited to this kind of collaboration, an insider at one maker told Yicai. Brands can benefit from cooperating with Kweichow Moutai because its liquor has a certain rarity and luxury, but the Zunyi-based company may not always profit from such tie-ups, the person noted.The unique taste of Kweichow Moutai liquor is its core competitiveness, according to a senior liquor dealer. Older people tend to order it in for banquets and business dinners as the pricey tipple has cachet, the person said.But the short-term consumption fad among the young will fade, the dealer pointed out, adding that the young will not have any special preference for high-end baijiu such as Kweichow Moutai.Editors: Shi Yi, Martin Kadiev",

            "description": "Only one day after its launch, a \"sauce-flavored\" latte has received widespread attention and created heated discussion on social media. Last week, China's domestic coffee brand Luckin launched the \"sauce-flavored\" latte laced with alcohol claimed to be from the high-end liquor brand Kweichow Moutai. According to Luckin, 5.42 million cups of the drink were sold on the first day of its launch, with the sales of the single product topping 100 million yuan (about $13.9 million), setting a new sales record for the coffee chain. At numerous outlets, the latte drink was in such high demand that it sold out within hours over the past several days. This unexpected, yet reasonable co-branding has allowed Luckin and Moutai to draw massive attention, creating a craze for coffee lovers to share pictures on social media. In recent years, co-branding strategy has become one of the most popular marketing methods. A successful co-branding can not only attract followers of both brands, increase the brand value, but also create greater commercial value and increase sales and profits. However, is co-branding truly a win-win cooperation or just a gimmick trying to get attention?03:30Creating 'trending topics' The collaboration between Moutai and Luckin has attracted a number of young consumers. On China's social media platform Weibo, words such as \"sauce-flavored latte\" and \"Moutai plus Luckin\" swept across trending topics. \"Young people's first cup of Moutai and elderly people's first cup of latte,\" a netizen wrote on social media, adding that Moutai is beyond the purse of most people in China. As China's liquor giant, Moutai's main consumer group is mainly those with relatively strong spending power, and the target audience of Luckin is mainly young people and urban white-collars. \"Through cooperation, the two brands can get closer to the consumers, and expand its respective consumer bases,\" a customer told CGTN. Moreover, a trendy Chinese tea chain store recently collaborated with an Italian luxury fashion brand to launch a time-limited co-branded drink at 19 yuan per cup. According to a trending topic in May, some people have even been able to sell a used cup at 10 yuan online. Industries such as ice cream, coffee and chocolate have become \"testing fields\" for brand innovation in recent years. For instance, Moutai has just announced its collaboration with chocolate brand Dove to launch liquor-filled chocolate. Through cross-border co-branding, different brands engage in cultural exchanges, integrating the characteristics and styles of both sides and creating more distinctive and meaningful products. Amid the popularization of symbols, different types of consumers have reached a consensus concerning what these symbols mean, and the direct impact is that most people tend to conform to the latest trends to manifest their status and taste. \"For us consumers, posting photos of these products on social media is a fulfilling moment and a good way to bond with friends,\" a consumer, who works as an advertising planner, told CGTN. \"I think it's all about chasing trends. If there is something new or interesting, I will give it a try,\" said another consumer. \"This kind of co-branding adds excitement and freshness into our daily life and Gen Z are more likely to be attracted to this,\" Doris Ke, founder&CEO of Digipont, told CGTN.04:01",

            "description": "(Yicai) Sept. 14 -- Kweichow Moutai, the world\u2019s most valuable distiller, has teamed up with Mars-owned Dove to launch baijiu-filled chocolate liquors this weekend in the hope of winning over more young Chinese consumers.The boozey chocolates will be sold at Kweichow Moutai\u2019s ice cream outlets and through Dove\u2019s sales channels, a person familiar with the matter told Yicai. A gift box costs between CNY35 and CNY179 (USD5 and USD24) on the firm\u2019s ice cream app, though orders are not yet being taken.The co-branded product is the latest from the CNY2.29 trillion (USD314 billion) company, which is experimenting with ways to boost its relevance to younger consumers. Less than two weeks ago, it released a hit baijiu-infused latte with China\u2019s Luckin Coffee and over 5.4 million cups worth CNY100 million (USD13.7 million) sold on the very first day.Baijiu is a traditional Chinese fiery liquor made from sorghum and grains such as wheat, barley, or rice. The best baijiu can command astronomical prices.The tie-up with Mars, which ranked as the world\u2019s top confectioner last year, is aimed at people who buy gifts for the holidays, said Zhu Danpeng, a food industry analyst. Chocolates tend to be bought as presents and not so much as part of the regular food shop, as people are paying more regard to their weight and nutrition.An eight-day Golden Week break that combines China\u2019s Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holiday will start at the end of this month.The chocolates are also part of Kweichow Moutai\u2019s go-global strategy, Zhu said. Even if they do not sell well, Dove is a well-known brand worldwide and the partnership will help Kweichow Moutai promote its baijiu on the international market, he added.Liquor makers are keen to seek more co-branding as they are worried about losing young consumers, analysts said. Habits are changing and baijiu is no longer the staple alcohol among younger generations.Only 11.2 percent of young people prefer drinks with an alcohol content of more than 30 percent, according to a report by Ries Positioning Pioneers. Baijiu only accounts for 13 percent of the group\u2019s preferred tipple, behind wine, cider, whiskey and beer.As an industry leader, Kweichow Moutai is keen to stay relevant and has been trying to build a more stylish and youthful image in recent years. In May last year, it launched Moutai ice cream with dairy firm Mengniu Dairy and sold nearly 10 million cups of the ice cream in the first 12 months.But Kweichow Moutai must not overdo it with co-brand products because there is a risk that they will hurt the value of its own brand if they are overdeveloped or inappropriately developed, said Cai Xuefei, an alcoholic beverage industry analyst.In the first half of this year, Kweichow Moutai\u2019s net profit jumped nearly 21 percent to CNY36 billion (USD5 billion) from a year ago thanks to rising sales through direct channels. Revenue also jumped 21 percent to CNY69.6 billion. Both figures beat expectations.Editor: Kim Taylor",

WU DONGJUN/FOR CHINA DAILYKweichow Moutai, a homegrown luxury liquor brand, has partnered with Mars Inc-owned Dove to make liquor-filled chocolate, in a bid to make its products more appealing to the country's younger generation.The product, which is expected to retail from Saturday, is priced at 35 yuan ($4.81) for a gift box of two pieces and 99 yuan for a box of six, according to Moutai's WeChat mini program. Products with less sugar are priced at 39 yuan for a box of two, 109 yuan for a box of six and 179 yuan for a box with a dozen pieces.Moutai announced the partnership with Dove on Thursday, just 12 days after it teamed up with China's largest coffee chain Luckin Coffee on a liquor-coffee drink which sold 5.42 million cups and reached sales of 100 million yuan on launch day.Mid-Autumn Festival that falls on Sept 29 is the primary gifting season for chocolate and alcoholic products in China.The Moutai-Dove tie-up has buoyed the chocolate market mood \u2014 which experienced growth challenges during the past three years \u2014 and is set to make the Moutai brand more accessible to young consumers in the country, said Jason Yu, general manager of Kantar Worldpanel China.Since young consumers often pursue healthy lifestyles, the consumption of chocolate has grown slowly in China, thereby entailing greater innovation in taste and packaging.According to market research firm Euromonitor International, the retail value of the chocolate confectionery sector in China has grown marginally in recent years, from 21.5 billion yuan in 2018 to 22.3 billion yuan in 2023. The sector is forecast to reach 25.6 billion yuan in 2028.The partnership means more in terms of branding than sales volume, said Zhu Danpeng, an independent food and beverages analyst.\"Behind every collaboration, the corporate value and persistence in long-term development make the longevity of a brand, not a one-time deal,\" he said. In recent years, \"liquor plus\" has become a driving force for Moutai to grow revenue and to get closer to consumers, he added.The domestic chocolate market is dominated by international confectionery brands. According to a 2021 report by iiMedia that ranked chocolate brands in China, Dove, Ferrero Rocher and Snickers were in the first tier, with sales higher than all other brands combined.Moutai has of late paid more attention to diversification and internationalization.In May, the nation's most renowned liquor brand said it had rolled out six types of ice cream products and begun to develop liquor-filled chocolate.The company said it now has 11 types of ice cream with the Moutai flavor, selling nearly 10 million cups this year. In 2022, sales of Moutai-flavored ice cream hit 262 million yuan, according to the company.Moreover, culturally innovative products, such as Moutai-themed blind-box gift sets, have been developed since 2022, contributing to nearly 600 million yuan in revenue last year.\"Dove's global branding and reputation offer Moutai a pivot to double down on its expansion in the home and overseas markets,\" said Zhu.",

            "description": "The buzz over the Luckin latte using Moutai liquor hasn't waned, with many ongoing discussions about how to tap into customers' enthusiasm for new flavors.The buzz over the Luckin latte using Moutai liquor hasn't waned, with many ongoing discussions about how to tap into customers' enthusiasm for new flavors, and also the implications and lessons for food and beverage innovation.It's much more popular than just a new-flavored coffee.Compared with the fresh coconut latte, one of Luckin's most popular drink previously that was sold an average 400,000 cups daily, the latte flavor using Kweichow Moutai-flavored distilled milk easily surpassed that number by tenfold.Priced at 19 yuan (US$2.62) in Luckin stores and online delivery, the Moutai latte sold 5.42 million cups on its launch day last week.Although some called the flavor just plain chocolate-touched latte, it did prove to be a sweeping business success generating more than 100 million yuan of sales in just one day. With the expected replenish of more Moutai liquor, the campaign is destined to be a record-breaking one in many aspects.ImaginechinaMarket watchers said it was a textbook case which not only involves marketing stunts, but a long-term strategy, carefully-designed tactics, thorough preparation for the supply chain, and detailed implementation.It's certainly a win-win situation where both parties are eyeing long term strategy instead of a short-term buzz.Kweichow Moutai, with the general version costing around 3,000 yuan for a 500ml bottle at most retail stores, is best known for its scarcity especially at premium dining and gifting occasions. It has now becomes more familiar and recognized as trendy and stylish by youngsters.It's ambition to become stylish and stay close to daily consumption was evident after its tie-up with Mengniu Dairy for liquor-flavored ice cream was launched last year.For Luckin, it also consolidated its leading position as an innovative coffee brand with easily accessible and reasonable price, along with the suitable taste.The coffee chain runs 10,836 outlets on the Chinese mainland, according to its second-quarter fiscal report, almost double the number of Starbucks stores.In addition to frequent buyers, it also attracted newcomers and might have well turned one-time visitors into long-term loyal customers.Some call it a classic \"lipstick effect\" which gives consumer the chance to get affordable luxury, having the feeling of riding on the latest wave.Indeed, some customers complained they have to wait hours for delivery and also missing coffee cup holders, but most regard the spending would not be something regretful for a sip of exceptional taste.ImaginechinaIt's not the first time beverage vendors have tied up with liquor brands, but the high exposure on social media and spontaneous discussions by the mass audience still surprised many.Manner's tie-up with the bourbon whisky brand Jim Bean also plays into the idea of coffee lover's taste for afterwork leisure demands.In August, Chinese milk tea leader Naixue worked with domestic liquor brand Luzhou Laojiao to roll out its new gifting package and online games.More than 40 tie-up coffee drinks and 60 cross-over tea drinks have been offered in the first half this year, according to a report by market and data consultancy Quest Mobile.It's hardly possible for other beverage vendors to match the level of success even with similar recipe. The idea of \"alcoholic coffee\" might not be intriguing for customers anymore.At the very least, Moutai and Luckin respond to most consumers' sentiment: curiosity, and the contradictory association of two iconic flavors.Coffee enthusiasts and liquor aficionados might not be the same group of people, but both are curious of how it would taste, generating significant excitement and anticipation even before the actual product launch.HelloRFThis also opens up the horizon for both home and foreign drink or snack vendors, allowing for more imagination for future collaborations that blend different flavors and cultural elements together.Drinks from specialist coffee and tea shops are expected to enjoy exponential growth in the coming years and gives much imagination when different elements converge into new tastes.Euromonitor International expects combined annual sales value at specialist coffee and tea shops such as Starbucks, Luckin, Tim Hortons as well as Heytea and Naixue to more than double to 283 billion yuan by 2027 from around 120 billion yuan in 2023.But not all remain positive regarding the long term perspective for the overall beverage sector.Nash Feng, vice president of Ries Positioning Strategy & Consulting China, pointed out Moutai has made its brand image and the elite liquor taste wildly accessible to the mass audience, and that might become an issue to retain its premium status.From the sales perspective Moutai has not gained tangible business income and it might risk not being regarded as scarce and luxurious anymore after it's put into millions of cups of coffee, he noted.Although such successful outcome would be unparalleled for later comers, the discussions are likely to go on and leaving much food for thought.",

(Photo by Alex Tai/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesChinese coffee giant Luckin Coffee hit 10,000 stores in China in June, surpassing Starbucks as the largest coffee chain brand in the country following rapid nationwide expansion this year. Founded in 2017, Luckin Coffee burst onto the Chinese coffee scene to challenge Starbucks through affordable coffee options and mobile ordering. China is Starbucks' second-largest market after the U.S. Luckin Coffee grew to 10,829 stores in China at the end of June, surpassing Starbucks as the largest coffee chain brand in the country following what one analyst calls an \"aggressive\" expansion. In comparison, Starbucks operated 6,480 stores in mainland China at the end of the second quarter. \"They are very aggressive in store expansion and in China, it is very common to buy a drink from Luckin for $2 or less after heavy discounts,\" said Jianggan Li, founder and CEO of tech research company Momentum Works.Luckin stores are also of a smaller format compared to Starbucks, which has much larger stores. Rahul Maheshwari Early-stage investorChina is traditionally a tea-drinking market, but over the last few years, coffee sales have been increasing steadily, especially in urban areas and among younger professionals. China's overall coffee sales will rise at an 8.7% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2022\u20132027, according to analytics firm GlobalData. CAGR is a measure of investment returns, which takes into account what an investment yields at an annual rate over a specified period.Aggressive expansionIn the quarter ended June 30, Luckin Coffee opened 1,485 new stores, averaging 16.5 new stores daily. Of the 10,829 stores in China, 7,181 are self-operated and 3,648 are partnership stores, according to the company's earnings transcript. The Chinese coffee chain expanded to Singapore in March in its first international foray and has opened 14 stores in the city-state so far, according to a CNBC check. Cumulative transacting customers surpassed 170 million, while average monthly transacting customers reached 43.07 million in the second quarter, according to the company. \"Luckin was able to expand so fast because of its operating model \u2014 which includes self-operated stores and franchises,\" said Li of Momentum Works. Meanwhile, Starbucks' stores worldwide are company-owned and the American coffee chain does not franchise operations, according to its website. Instead, it sells licenses to operate. In the quarter ended July 2, the company opened 588 new stores \u2014 about 40% of Luckin's count. Vivian Leung, an office worker residing in Guangzhou, said that there are at least two Luckin Coffee outlets within 50 meters from her apartment.TIANJIN, CHINA - 2023/07/24: Customers are waiting in front of the counter. Zhang Peng | Lightrocket | Getty Images\"Franchising unlocks very fast growth because you don't have to put that amount of capital. Otherwise you will always be limited from growth. The density of Luckin stores is so high where there's a store in almost every neighborhood,\" said Rahul Maheshwari, an early-stage investor in Asia. He previously worked in Beijing at a Chinese venture capital firm and as a general manager with a Chinese app. \"Luckin stores are also of a smaller format compared to Starbucks, which has much larger stores,\" said Maheshwari.Luckin found mass market appeal. Price wise, it is already differentiated from Starbucks. Quality wise, it's still better, compared to many of the low end brands. Jianggan Li Founder and CEO at Momentum Works\"As you can imagine, the asset-heavy model is expensive to operate and slow to scale,\" said Momentum Works in a report. Luckin operates a grab-and-go model, where customers order from the app and pick up their orders at the store, unlike Starbucks which offers a cozy environment for people to work and socialize. As a result, Luckin has lower operating costs and can \"break even within a year,\" said Maheshwari.Mass market appealLuckin and Starbucks have different pricing strategies. A cup of coffee from Luckin costs 10 to 20 yuan, or about $1.40 to $2.75. That's because Luckin offers heavy discounts and offers. Meanwhile, a cup of coffee from Starbucks is priced at 30 yuan or more \u2014 that's at least $4.10. \"Luckin found mass market appeal. Price wise, it is already differentiated from Starbucks. Quality wise, it's still better, compared to many of the low end brands,\" said Li. According to Guangzhou resident Leung, she said that Luckin Coffee is \"delicious and affordable.\" Luckin is also looking to collaboration and partnerships to raise the profile of its brand. Last Tuesday, the company launched a new drink with Kweichow Moutai, a Chinese liquor maker famed for its \"baijiu,\" or white liquor made from rice grains. The Chinese coffee chain said that it sold 5.42 million Moutai alcohol-infused lattes on the first day of its launch.Moutai, sometimes called maotai, is a premium distilled Chinese liquor and has been dubbed the \"national liquor of China.\" Moutai topped the list of spirits brands with a value of $42.9 billion, according to a 2022 study by valuation consultancy Brand Finance. Shawn Yang, managing director at Blue Lotus Research Institute, said it was a strategic move to \"offer premium products to offset the sense of cheapness from 9.9 yuan per cup.\" \"Luckin [extended its] customer base by leveraging the influence of legacy Chinese brands, including Moutai and Coconut Palm,\" said Yang in a report. Other localized hits with the Chinese market include brown sugar boba latte, as well as cheese latte and coconut latte. \"Luckin Coffee has played an important role in deepening the coffee market in China by introducing products which would suit the Chinese customer,\" said Maheshwari in a recent blog post.Making a comeback?",

He entrusted a significant portion of his family\u2019s fortune \u2014 $88 million \u2014 to Li Lu, often referred to as the Chinese Warren Buffett.This bold investment, though carrying its share of risk, not only remained secure but also experienced substantial growth. It is now estimated at approximately $400 million.\u201cWe made unholy good returns for a long, long time,\u201d Munger said. \u201cThat $88 million has become four or five times that.\u201dDon\u2019t Miss:It used to take a fortune to own premium bottles, but right now, $25 is enough to get started in this $229.4 billion asset class.Their first encounter took place at a mutual friend\u2019s residence in Los Angeles shortly after Li\u2019s college graduation. Munger initially came across as somewhat reserved, absorbed in his thoughts rather than fully immersed in conversation. Despite this initial impression, their discourse was imbued with Munger\u2019s concise yet profoundly insightful words of wisdom.It wasn\u2019t until seven years later, during a Thanksgiving lunch in 2003, that Munger and Li engaged in what Li described as a \u201clong heart-to-heart conversation.\u201d Impressed by Li\u2019s prowess in the realm of investments, Munger backed him with personal funds when Li embarked on a new fund venture in 2004.Li\u2019s investment track record boasts notable achievements, including Kweichow Moutai, a liquor brand that has surged in value over the past two decades and ranks among China\u2019s largest listed companies. It\u2019s even been named China\u2019s national liquor.Despite being amid the pandemic, Kweichow Moutai had a fantastic year. In 2020, its stock on the Shanghai Stock Exchange rose by about 70%. The company, which is partly owned by the government and partly publicly traded, is China\u2019s most valuable business outside of the tech sector. It\u2019s worth more than the country\u2019s four largest banks.Munger commended Li\u2019s astute decision-making, noting, \u201cIt was real cheap, four to five times earnings, and Li Lu just backed up the truck, bought all he could and made a killing.\u201dLoading... Loading... Loading...The investment strategy Li employed hinges on his knack for identifying undervalued prospects. This approach underscores that sometimes, it is the less conventional investments that harbor the greatest potential for substantial growth. Li\u2019s ability to recognize opportunities when companies are undervalued has allowed him to unlock exceptional value over time.Li\u2019s most renowned investment is in BYD Co. Ltd., a manufacturer of batteries and electric vehicles. Li initially invested in BYD in 2002, a move that laid the groundwork for both Buffett and Munger to follow suit six years later.Munger, acknowledging the extraordinary success, described the early investment in BYD as a \u201cmiracle.\u201d In a CNBC interview, he said that BYD has outpaced Tesla Inc. in China, a statement that contrasts with Buffett\u2019s views on the electric vehicle industry. Buffett has expressed concerns about excessive competition.While Munger placed immense trust in Li, considering him the sole outsider he has ever entrusted with his finances, he also predicted that Li would eventually assume a significant role at Berkshire Hathaway.Read Next:Goldman Sachs says: Portfolio(s) with a slice of real assets [like art] performed even better than the 60/40 over the long run.",

But it happened in our very own Nanjing.Luckin Coffee launched its new drink on 4 September, through a cooperation with Kweichow Moutai in which the baijiu producer hopes to bring in a new, younger generation of drinkers.And drivers, it would perhaps seem, as Nanjing Daily reported this morning, 14 September.It was at approximately 23:00 on 8 September when Nanjing Traffic Police inspected a car registered to the city of Dongguan in Guangdong Province. That was at the Heye Shan Service Area on the G4221 Shanghai\u2013Wuhan Expressway as it makes its way through Nanjing\u2019s Lishui District.The driver, surnamed Xu, was found to have a blood-alcohol content of 21mg/100ml, sufficient to reach the standard for driving under the influence.Yet, Xu coloured the issue by saying he had been drinking Luckin\u2019s new baijiu coffee and that it was responsible for his high blood-alcohol content.Later however, Xu admitted that he had also drank two glasses of draft beer in Changshu of Suzhou City at around 14:00 that day. He explained that he had heard from his friends he would nevertheless be safe to drive in in 4 hours, so he waited until the evening to drive back.In the end, Xu will face a fine of \u00a51,000 for driving a non-commercial motor vehicle after drinking alcohol, his driver\u2019s license will be deducted 12 points and he shall be suspended from driving for 6 months.The Luckin latte\u2019s alcohol content is in fact less than 0.5 percent. Our inebriated driver would have had to drink so much of the stuff to be over the driving limit that he would have been sick from the coffee, not the alcohol.",

The companies said the latte alcohol content was lower than 0.5% of its volume.The launch comes amid a slowing economy and as Kweichow Moutai, whose alcohol sells at an average market guide price of 1,499 yuan, has been looking for ways to be more accessible and pull in a new generation of users. The company, based in China's southwestern Guizhou province, also launched a baijiu-infused ice cream last year.Chinese social media users posted videos of themselves picking up cups of the drink and being told by sales staff that they should not drive after drinking it. By Monday afternoon in Beijing and Shanghai, Luckin's app showed that the drink had sold out at several stores.Independent food industry analyst Zhu Danpeng said the collaboration would most likely benefit both brands.\"Moutai and Luckin are the leading enterprises in the domestic liquor and coffee sectors, respectively,\" Zhu said. \"On the one hand, Moutai accelerates its brand rejuvenation through cooperation with Luckin and on the other hand, for Luckin, its cooperation with Moutai also helps to improve its comprehensive strength and brand tone in the coffee industry.\"Luckin has been aggressively expanding its store portfolio in China after surviving an accounting fraud scandal in 2020 that forced it to withdraw from the Nasdaq exchange and brought it to the brink of collapse.($1 = 7.2640 Chinese yuan)Reporting by Sophie Yu and Brenda Goh; Editing by Gerry DoyleOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

Customers who order with an online coupon will be able to receive 50% off for a limited time, it said.The \u201csauce\u201d in the name is an apparent reference to the slightly savory notes of Moutai\u2019s liquor that has been compared by some drinkers to soy sauce.The new drink quickly became a hot topic on Chinese social media, with many users wondering if it was safe to consume on the go. The question \u201cCan we drive a car after drinking that Moutai coffee?\u201d was the number one subject on social network Weibo on Monday, with 430 million views.Moutai\u2019s baijiu is a throat-tingling spirit that typically contains 53% alcohol.The clear, potent spirit has been dubbed \u201cfirewater,\u201d thanks to its strong taste. The red-and-white bottles of Moutai\u2019s flagship product, \u201cFeitian,\u201d or \u201cFlying Fairy,\u201d are a staple at Chinese state banquets and business events.For its new tie-up with Luckin, each cup has just a tiny fraction of liquor, with an overall alcohol content of about 0.5%, according to Luckin.The company suggests, though, that drivers, teenagers and pregnant women should refrain from drinking the latte.The new drink, offered to customers with a spurt of whipped cream on top, is the latest effort by Moutai to diversify its offerings.Last year, the brand showcased another surprising use of its liquor by opening a Moutai ice cream store, selling spiked desserts to consumers in the city of Zunyi in southwest China\u2019s Guizhou province.The format proved a big hit, with nearly 10 million cups sold as of a year later, the company said in a statement this May.Luckin Coffee has made a comeback with consumers after becoming mired in a fraud scandal that caused its ejection from Wall Street three years ago.The coffee chain is once again a leading brand in China, and currently says it operates as many as 10,000 stores across more than 240 Chinese cities.\u2014 Nectar Gan contributed to this report.",

The collaboration was an instant hit, with long queues forming outside the 10,000-plus Luckin coffee shops distributed across China, and several related hashtags topping Weibo\u2019s Hot List, each with over 100 million views. For instance, the Luckin Coffee Real Moutai (\u745e\u5e78 \u771f\u8305\u53f0) hashtag has amassed over 120 million views on Weibo to date.According to the official online release, \u2018Moutai Latte\u2019 is made with a liquor-flavored milk that contains Kweichow Moutai. The level of alcohol in the beverage is less than 0.50 percent, making it acceptable for young cohorts trying it for the first time.Price-wise, the tie-up is pocket-friendly. A cup costs 38 RMB ($5.3), and if paired with coupons as little as $2.6 (19 RMB), which widens the beverage\u2019s appeal.The surprising partnership has taken Chinese social media by storm. Weibo user @Yuexiwu commented that her WeChat\u2019s Friend\u2019s post feeds \u201care dominated by this Moutai Latte.\u201dThe Jing Take: Kweichow Moutai, produced by state-owned Kweichow Moutai Company, is a high-end liquor, traditionally beloved by middle-aged and older people, and usually served at important gatherings. However, young Chinese are rejecting these baijiu, or white spirit brands believed to be more for seniors rather than the young. Instead, coffee is becoming the favored beverage by young consumers.Through the partnership with Luckin Coffee, Moutai is using a fresh way to popularize its product\u2019s taste and brand among China\u2019s younger demographic. More than a PR stunt, the collaboration is a shrewd strategy for Moutai to lay the foundation for future sales.On the one hand, Kweichow Moutai Company has bigger ambitions. The spirits giant hopes to expand from the alcohol category to the food industry. Since setting foot in the ice cream sector in 2021, when it collaborated with homegrown diary label Meng Niu, Moutai-flavored ice cream has been sold in over 160 Chinese cities. In May this year, the chairman of Moutai group, Ding Xiong Jun, claimed sales of Moutai ice cream had hit nearly 10 million cups, priced at $9 (66 RMB) per cup.Meanwhile, in 2023, Luckin Coffee surpassed Starbucks\u2019 sales in China for the first time, thanks to its rapid expansion. Luckin reported an impressive 88 percent year-on-year increase in revenue in the second quarter of 2023, amounting to $862 million (6.2 billion RMB), surpassing Starbucks\u2019 sales by more than $27.5 million (200 million RMB). No wonder Moutai chose Luckin to engage China\u2019s young consumers.The collaboration seems to be a winning formula for both. The high-low partnership has tapped China\u2019s guochao trend, offered surprise, delight, and nostalgia for consumers, and earned both brands new virality.The Jing Take reports on a piece of the leading news and presents our editorial team\u2019s analysis of the key implications for the luxury industry.

Given the ongoing price war being waged in China\u2019s coffee market, which has seen the average price of a cup of coffee plummet to 9.9 RMB (1.4 USD), consumers are curious as to how the campaign will strike the balance between premiumisation and remaining competitive.The campaign has prompted jokes about the potential outcome of combining coffee and alcohol in one product, with remarks like \u201cdrunk and alert at the same time\u201d and \u201ccan I drive a car after drinking this?\u201d filling comments sections under relevant posts on Xiaohongshu and Weibo. Netizens also joked about Luckin\u2019s penchant for boundary-pushing collaborations, coming up with their own predictions for the next collaboration, such as \u201cLuckin x Chongqing hot pot soup base\u201d.While Luckin looks to add prestige to its brand image, Moutai hopes to connect more with younger consumers. The past 18 months have seen Moutai push alcohol-flavoured snacks to new limits, with the most notable example being Moutai Ice Cream launched in partnership with the dairy giant Mengniu in May 2022.The upcoming collaboration with Luckin is reportedly not Moutai\u2019s first experimentation with coffee. Since June, the brand has been testing the waters at its ice cream stores in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Chongqing, with online menus revealing a huge range of bubble tea and coffee, with the option of a 2ml Moutai add-on.ShareJoin our newsletter",

During a signing ceremony between Moutai and Huawei on Sunday, Wang signed a memorandum of strategic cooperation as deputy secretary of the Party Committee and general manager of Moutai.Wang was born in October 1972 in northwest China\u2019s Shaanxi Province. After her graduation in 1994 with a degree in Food Engineering from Northwestern Polytechnical University, she joined the ranks of Moutai.Wang Li. (File photo)Public reports indicate that Wang\u2019s research focuses on fermentation and light industry biotechnology. She received a special government allowance and has been honored with titles such as Leading Talent in China's Liquor Industry and Chinese Liquor Master.In 2004, she collaborated with Jiangnan University to lead Maotai's first-ever flavor research project, titled \"Construction of the Technical System for the Analysis of Flavor Substances in Moutai Liquor.\"The following year, she became deputy director of the Technical Center of Kweichow Moutai Liquor Co., Ltd.She also obtained a master's degree in Light Industry Technology and Engineering from Jiangnan University and co-authored a paper titled \"Near Infrared Spectroscopy and Its Application Prospect in Quality Control of Liquor\" as the lead author.This paper discusses the application of near-infrared spectroscopy technology in raw material detection, fermentation process control, and liquor quality control.On Feb. 9, 2021, the Guizhou Provincial Association for Science and Technology recommended Wang as one of the four proposed candidates for the Chinese Academy of Engineering in Guizhou Province for 2021.This notice sparked widespread public attention and debate over the necessity of academic involvement in the brewing industry. Some netizens humorously referred to her as the \"Moutai Academician\" or the \"Sauce Fragrance Academician.\"In response, the Guizhou Daily published a commentary criticizing such identity-centric labeling, stating that proficient researchers in any technical field hold the right to engage in high-level discussions. Such confidence and courage in this regard should not be taken lightly. Whether Wang can ultimately become a finalist or awardee depends on a more detailed and professional evaluation process.In April 2021, the Chinese Academy of Engineering released a list of valid candidates for the year's academicians, a list on which Wang's name did not appear.",

La decisi\u00f3n podr\u00eda llegar en cualquier momento; El Ministerio de Finanzas, encabezado por el Consejo de Estado, present\u00f3 un proyecto de propuesta al Gabinete a principios de agosto. Los analistas, sin embargo, dudan de que esto realmente ayude a los \u00edndices. Morgan Stanley redujo su expectativa de junio de 2024 para el \u00edndice MSCI China en un 14%, citando valoraciones de empresas excesivamente altas en medio de menores expectativas de ganancias para el a\u00f1o en curso, incertidumbre en el mercado inmobiliario y el fallido apoyo del Banco Popular de China a la econom\u00eda. Fuente: Bloomberg Finance LP Comience a invertir hoy o pruebe una demo gratuitamente Hazte Cliente PRUEBE UNA DEMO Descarga la app m\u00f3vil Descarga la app m\u00f3vil Actualmente, se espera que una propuesta para reducir el actual impuesto (actualmente del 0,1%) sobre la compra de valores sugiera un recorte del 20% o del 50% (la primera medida de este tipo desde 2008). Los impuestos y tasas por la negociaci\u00f3n de acciones en 2023 equivalieron al 1,35% de los ingresos del presupuesto de China.Los analistas apuntan a este impulso a corto plazo, ya que las preocupaciones sobre la econom\u00eda siguen vivas y la situaci\u00f3n del mercado inmobiliario y la \"banca en la sombra\" contin\u00faan frenando el apetito por el riesgo. Las autoridades chinas siguen mostr\u00e1ndose reticentes a lanzar un amplio est\u00edmulo a la econom\u00eda.Durante 13 sesiones consecutivas, los inversores extranjeros vendieron acciones de empresas que cotizan en Hong Kong, con ventas totales que ascendieron a unos 11.000 millones de d\u00f3lares. Esta fue la salida m\u00e1s grande de inversores del mercado de valores en la historia del mercado de valores chino; se vendieron principalmente acciones de empresas de primera l\u00ednea chinas, lo que refleja la incertidumbre en torno al impulso de la econom\u00eda.La liquidaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s fuerte la registr\u00f3 Kweichow Moutai (el mayor productor de licores de China), con casi 851 millones de d\u00f3lares. Las acciones de China Merchants Bank y de empresas de energ\u00eda renovable, incluida LONGi Green Energy Technology, tambi\u00e9n sufrieron fuertes ventas. Como vemos en el gr\u00e1fico del indice, los alcistas detuvieron las ca\u00eddas en el importante nivel de 17.500 puntos donde tambi\u00e9n se puede ver el retroceso de Fibonacci de 61,8 de la onda ascendente de 2022. En el escenario de un rebote m\u00e1s amplio, una resistencia importante parece ser en el nivel entre 19.500 y 20.000 puntos donde vemos el SMA200 (l\u00ednea roja) y el retroceso de Fibonacci de 38,2. Si la econom\u00eda muestra debilidad, la zona de soporte se presentaria en 17.000 puntos o 71,6 de Fibonacci.

            "description": "Hong Kong | Financial TimesOutrora conhecida como uma das prov\u00edncias mais pobres da China, a regi\u00e3o montanhosa de Guizhou ficou famosa na \u00faltima d\u00e9cada por uma raz\u00e3o diferente: ela abriga algumas das pontes mais altas do mundo.Desde a ponte sobre o Rio Duge Beipan, com 565 metros de altura, que liga Guizhou \u00e0 prov\u00edncia vizinha de Yunnan, at\u00e9 a ponte Pingtang, com 332 metros de altura, que atravessa o desfiladeiro do Rio Caodu, o investimento de Guizhou em infraestruturas ajudou a tirar a prov\u00edncia da pobreza, conquistando elogios especiais do presidente Xi Jinping.Mas o terreno elevado tamb\u00e9m tem um alto custo. A d\u00edvida de Guizhou totalizava 1,2 bilh\u00e3o de iuans (R$ 800 milh\u00f5es) no final de 2022. Com uma propor\u00e7\u00e3o d\u00edvida/produto interno bruto de 62%, \u00e9 uma das prov\u00edncias mais endividadas da China.Pr\u00e9dios em constru\u00e7\u00e3o em Pequim, na China - Tingshu Wang - 11.jan.2023/ReutersA enorme quantidade de empr\u00e9stimos acumulados pelas prov\u00edncias chinesas, muitos deles atrav\u00e9s de ve\u00edculos de financiamento dos governos locais (LGFV na sigla em ingl\u00eas) \u2013empresas de investimento que contraem d\u00edvidas e constroem infraestruturas em nome dos governos locais\u2013, tornou-se um enorme problema para a segunda maior economia do mundo. O aumento da tens\u00e3o entre os governos locais e centrais sobre a d\u00edvida surge num momento em que Pequim procura novos modelos de crescimento econ\u00f4mico regional.\"Os LGFVs s\u00e3o um legado do antigo modelo de crescimento de expans\u00e3o da oferta que dependia de investimentos pesados para criar empregos e rendimentos\", disse Chi Lo, estrategista s\u00eanior de investimentos do BNP Paribas Asset Management em Hong Kong. \"A estrutura de crescimento da China est\u00e1 mudando agora. Quando ela muda, os antigos ve\u00edculos de financiamento que serviram \u00e0 velha economia tornam-se obsoletos.\"Os governos locais, normalmente sustentados por verbas de Pequim e pelos lucros provenientes da venda de terrenos, h\u00e1 muito s\u00e3o incentivados a contrair empr\u00e9stimos para financiar o desenvolvimento regional.O primeiro LGFV foi criado por volta de 1998 para financiar a constru\u00e7\u00e3o de uma rodovia. A pr\u00e1tica ganhou tra\u00e7\u00e3o ap\u00f3s um pacote de est\u00edmulo de 4 bilh\u00f5es de iuans (R$ 2,68 bilh\u00f5es) em 2009, que incentivou as prov\u00edncias a investir e impulsionar o crescimento. Os bancos viam os LGFVs \u2013implicitamente apoiados pelos governos locais\u2013 como clientes seguros e, no final de 2022, a d\u00edvida oficial dos governos locais da China totalizava 94 bilh\u00f5es de iuans (R$ 62,98 bilh\u00f5es), de acordo com uma estimativa do Goldman Sachs.As finan\u00e7as dos governos locais entraram em colapso durante a pandemia do coronav\u00edrus, em parte devido ao aumento das despesas p\u00fablicas relacionadas \u00e0 Covid e a uma queda na venda de terrenos dos quais dependiam para obter receitas. Com uma enorme pilha de repagamentos de d\u00edvidas onshore com vencimento em 2023 e 2024, aumentou a press\u00e3o sobre os governos locais, que j\u00e1 enfrentam dificuldades durante uma desacelera\u00e7\u00e3o econ\u00f4mica.\"A d\u00edvida local est\u00e1 aumentando de forma incontrol\u00e1vel\", disse Victor Shih, professor de economia pol\u00edtica chinesa na Universidade da Calif\u00f3rnia em San Diego. \"A depend\u00eancia dos governos locais do governo central e da emiss\u00e3o de d\u00edvida est\u00e1 piorando cada vez mais, de uma forma muito r\u00e1pida.\"Uma quase inadimpl\u00eancia por parte de Zunyi, segunda maior cidade de Guizhou, em dezembro, alimentou preocupa\u00e7\u00f5es de uma crise financeira sist\u00eamica e esperan\u00e7as de resgates do governo central. A Zunyi reestruturou seu empr\u00e9stimo de 15,6 bilh\u00f5es de iuans junto dos bancos em janeiro, chocando os credores. A Comiss\u00e3o Reguladora de Valores Mobili\u00e1rios da China prometeu na semana passada evitar inadimpl\u00eancias nos t\u00edtulos LGFV.Pequim decidiu enviar equipes de funcion\u00e1rios do banco central, do Minist\u00e9rio das Finan\u00e7as e do \u00f3rg\u00e3o de fiscaliza\u00e7\u00e3o de valores mobili\u00e1rios para mais de dez prov\u00edncias com finan\u00e7as mais fracas, para examinarem seus livros e encontrarem formas de reduzir as d\u00edvidas. Ser\u00e3o avaliados os balan\u00e7os dos governos para decidir qual a melhor forma de reduzir os ativos duvidosos e a d\u00edvida. Acad\u00eamicos, especialistas e outros j\u00e1 deram informa\u00e7\u00f5es \u00e0s autoridades, incluindo o primeiro-ministro, Li Qiang, segundo documentos de representa\u00e7\u00e3o obtidos pelo Financial Times.Uma sugest\u00e3o \u00e9 trocar parte dos estimados 59 bilh\u00f5es de iuans por \"d\u00edvida oculta\" \u2013empr\u00e9stimos que n\u00e3o s\u00e3o contabilizados e muitas vezes obtidos atrav\u00e9s de canais privados por t\u00edtulos oficiais do governo local. A ag\u00eancia de informa\u00e7\u00f5es financeiras chinesa Caixin informou no domingo que at\u00e9 1,5 trilh\u00e3o de iuans poder\u00e3o ser trocados. Mas, como argumentou repetidamente em discursos p\u00fablicos o antigo ministro das Finan\u00e7as, Lou Jiwei, muitas dessas trocas apenas atrasariam a resolu\u00e7\u00e3o do problema, em \u00faltima an\u00e1lise aumentando a alavancagem.Espera-se tamb\u00e9m que os especialistas sugiram o aumento da maturidade dos empr\u00e9stimos aos LGFVs para 25-30 anos e a redu\u00e7\u00e3o das taxas de juros, dando aos LGFVs algum espa\u00e7o para respirar para encontrar novas fontes de receitas. Os bancos absorveriam indiretamente os custos. O risco de tal reestrutura\u00e7\u00e3o levou alguns bancos de investimento a reavaliarem as classifica\u00e7\u00f5es dos bancos estatais com elevada exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a LGFVs. Os lucros dos bancos comerciais seriam 6% mais baixos se 10% dos seus empr\u00e9stimos LGFVs fossem reestruturados, de acordo com uma simula\u00e7\u00e3o hist\u00f3rica de estresse conduzida por Wang Jian, analista da Guosen Securities.A maneira mais direta de reduzir a d\u00edvida seria a venda de ativos. No caso de Guizhou, especialistas sugeriram durante anos a venda ou penhora parcial de sua participa\u00e7\u00e3o na Kweichow Moutai, a fabricante de bebidas alco\u00f3licas mais valiosa do mundo, disse uma pessoa familiarizada com as negocia\u00e7\u00f5es. Mas, apesar da press\u00e3o do governo central para a venda, os governos locais se mostraram relutantes.\"A suposi\u00e7\u00e3o do governo central \u00e9 que o ativo \u00e9 mais do que suficiente para pagar a d\u00edvida, o que \u00e9 verdade at\u00e9 certo ponto\", disse Ivan Chung, diretor-gerente da Moody's Investors Service. \"Mas \u00e9 uma quest\u00e3o de qu\u00e3o rapidamente esses ativos podem ser transformados em dinheiro, especialmente nas prov\u00edncias ocidentais mais fracas.\"Esta relut\u00e2ncia fala de uma tens\u00e3o entre os governos locais e o central sobre o problema da d\u00edvida.\"A mentalidade subjacente [da resist\u00eancia] \u00e9 pol\u00edtica\", disse um importante banqueiro estatal que lida com a d\u00edvida do governo local de Guizhou. \"Pontes e estradas s\u00e3o constru\u00eddas em resposta aos apelos ao crescimento econ\u00f4mico e \u00e0 redu\u00e7\u00e3o da pobreza. Mas por que as localidades deveriam agora assumir todos os custos em nome do governo central?\"Numa declara\u00e7\u00e3o dirigida \u00e0s autoridades locais, o Minist\u00e9rio das Finan\u00e7as disse em fevereiro: \"Se o beb\u00ea \u00e9 seu, voc\u00ea \u00e9 quem deve segur\u00e1-lo... O governo central n\u00e3o vai socorr\u00ea-lo\".Em maio, o departamento financeiro de Guiyang, capital da prov\u00edncia, afirmou em comunicado que tinha \"feito todo o poss\u00edvel\" para lidar com sua d\u00edvida. A declara\u00e7\u00e3o foi posteriormente retirada do site da ag\u00eancia.Em longo prazo, especialistas argumentam que o papel dos LGFVs na economia da China precisa ser fundamentalmente reformulado.Numa apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o ao primeiro-ministro Li em julho, Luo Zhiheng, analista macroecon\u00f4mico-chefe da Yuekai Securities, disse que os governos locais deveriam reduzir seus gastos alimentados pela d\u00edvida e confiar mais nas receitas fiscais ou nos fundos do governo central para investimento. Isto estaria em linha com a tentativa da China de \"reconstruir a base das receitas fiscais\", disse Luo, conforme uma c\u00f3pia da apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o vista pelo Financial Times. Mais impostos sobre im\u00f3veis e renda pessoal poderiam ser implementados quando chegar a hora certa, disseram outros especialistas.Outra solu\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 permitir que o governo central capte mais dinheiro. \"Ainda h\u00e1 espa\u00e7o para o governo central incorrer em d\u00e9ficits. Mas penso que \u00e9 amplamente entendido pelos economistas na China como sendo a \u00faltima 'muni\u00e7\u00e3o' fiscal que o governo chin\u00eas tem\", disse Shih.O impacto da crise da d\u00edvida tem sido evidente nos servi\u00e7os prestados pelos governos locais.Na prov\u00edncia de Heilongjiang, no extremo norte, os moradores tiveram dificuldades para aquecer suas casas no inverno, depois que os fornecedores locais de g\u00e1s restringiram a oferta. As empresas culparam a falta de subs\u00eddios governamentais.Na cidade de Zhangjiakou, na prov\u00edncia de Hebei, onde foram realizados parte dos Jogos Ol\u00edmpicos de Inverno de Pequim em 2022, os or\u00e7amentos locais est\u00e3o cada vez mais sobrecarregados.Um funcion\u00e1rio p\u00fablico em Zhangjiakou, que pediu o anonimato porque n\u00e3o estava autorizado a falar com a imprensa, disse que n\u00e3o confiava mais em receber o pagamento. \"Receber sal\u00e1rio \u00e9 como jogar dados\", disse o servidor. \"Voc\u00ea nunca sabe quanto receber\u00e1 no pr\u00f3ximo pagamento mensal.\"A constru\u00e7\u00e3o das pontes em Guizhou foi um processo que durou d\u00e9cadas. Desfazer a complexa rede de finan\u00e7as locais tamb\u00e9m pode levar anos.\"O processo de limpeza provavelmente ser\u00e1 caro e economicamente doloroso\", disse Lo, do BNP Paribas. \"\u00c9 um processo de inadimpl\u00eancia controlado para eliminar ativos ruins e desalavancar o sistema, permitindo que mais LGFVs ruins v\u00e3o \u00e0 fal\u00eancia... enquanto os processos de reestrutura\u00e7\u00e3o e redu\u00e7\u00e3o da d\u00edvida avan\u00e7am.\"(Colaborou Edward White, em Seul)Tradu\u00e7\u00e3o de Luiz Roberto M.

Photo: Leah Millis/Pool Photo via AP (Leah Millis, Associated Press)The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) continued its positive run on Wednesday, outperforming against its peers, as traders offloaded shares in China\u2019s blue-chip firms at a record pace amid growing concerns about the world\u2019s second largest economy.London's benchmark index rose 0.6% and closed the session in the green, helped by a weaker pound and a rise in mining stocks on the back of gains in metal and gold prices.Meanwhile the CAC (^FCHI) was treading water in Paris but also closed higher, and the Frankfurt DAX (^GDAXI) also gained despite new data showing that Germany suffered the steepest drop in business activity since May 2020.Across the pond, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was up 0.7% an hour before the European close and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) was 1.1% higher. The Dow Jones (^DJI) was 0.2% higher.It came as overseas funds fled the Chinese market, offloading the equivalent of \u00a37.3bn ($9.29bn) in a 12-day run of withdrawals to Tuesday, the longest since Bloomberg began tracking the data in 2016.According to the latest data on individual stocks available, foreign investors sold 6.2bn yuan (\u00a3676m) of Kweichow Moutai (600519.SS) from 7 to 18 August, making China\u2019s largest spirits maker the most heavily sold stock via trading links with Hong Kong.It was followed by 4.7bn yuan of selling each for leading renewables stock LONGi Green Energy Technology (601012.SS) and major lender China Merchants Bank (600036.SS).\"The FTSE 100 managed to finally break its worst run of losses since 2019 yesterday, posting its first daily gain since 10 August.

Newbabyandyou \u00b7 Follow 2 min read \u00b7 Aug 23 -- ShareIntroductionHey, business enthusiasts and market watchers! \ud83d\udcc8 If you\u2019ve ever wondered which companies are ruling the world in 2023, you\u2019re in for a treat. We\u2019re diving deep into the 50 most valuable companies, and trust me, the numbers are staggering! So, let\u2019s get into it.The Trillion-Dollar ClubFirst off, let\u2019s talk about the big guns. There are only a handful of companies that have crossed the trillion-dollar mark, and they are the usual suspects: Apple, Microsoft, Saudi Aramco, Amazon, Alphabet, and Nvidia. Meta and Tesla used to be part of this elite club but have fallen to the $700 billion range. What happened? Well, Meta faced a decline in earnings, and Tesla had some demand concerns.Sector Spotlight: IT Takes the Cake \ud83c\udf70When it comes to sectors, Information Technology is the undisputed king, with a combined market cap of $9.3 trillion. Following IT, the Consumer Discretionary sector stands at $4.0 trillion, and Health Care is at $3.3 trillion. It\u2019s clear that tech is not just a trend; it\u2019s a titan!The American Dream is Alive and Well \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8Geographically speaking, the majority of these top 50 companies are based in the United States. But let\u2019s not forget about Switzerland, France, and China, each contributing three companies to the list. From Switzerland, we have healthcare giants like Roche and Novartis. France gives us fashion moguls like LVMH and Herm\u00e8s, and China brings in tech giants Tencent and Alibaba.The Richest Man in the WorldSpeaking of LVMH, its CEO Bernard Arnault was officially declared the richest person in the world earlier this year, with a fortune of $215 billion. Now that\u2019s what I call \u201cfashionably rich!\u201dThe Underdog: Kweichow Moutai \ud83c\udf7eChina\u2019s third entry, Kweichow Moutai, deserves a special mention. It\u2019s a partially state-owned producer of alcoholic beverages. While it may not be as globally recognized as Tencent or Alibaba, it\u2019s a testament to the diverse range of industries that can make it to the top.The Limitations of Market CapWhile market capitalization is a straightforward way to rank companies, it\u2019s not without its limitations. It doesn\u2019t account for debt or cash, so take these rankings with a grain of salt.Note: The facts and statistics in this blog are based on an article from Visual Capitalist.",

            "description": "Starbucks may be the largest coffee chain in the world, but in China, it\u2019s now left to play second fiddle to Luckin Coffee, which has officially claimed the title of China\u2019s largest branded coffee chain.After surpassing Starbucks in domestic store count in 2021, Luckin overtook the American coffee chain in terms of revenue too, as of the second quarter of 2023. In this quarter, it even achieved its goal of establishing 10,000 stores ahead of schedule, achieving an operating profit margin of 18.9%.With China\u2019s domestic coffee market expected to reach a value of RMB 1 trillion by 2025, Luckin\u2019s newfound lead is drawing widespread interest.Overthrowing the incumbentLuckin\u2019s latest financial report highlights remarkable progress. In Q2 2023, its revenue surged by 88% year-on-year, reaching RMB 6.2 billion, outperforming Starbucks in China (RMB 5.96 billion).To celebrate this milestone, Jinyi Guo, chairman and CEO of Luckin, announced that the RMB 9.9 coffee promotion will extend for at least two more years. Luckin will also accelerate the expansion of self-operated and joint-operated stores in the foreseeable future.In the second quarter of this year, Luckin opened 1,485 new stores, averaging 16.3 new stores daily, and opened a total of 10,829 stores by the end of June 2023. In the Chinese food and beverage market, 10,000 stores represent a massive market scale and volume, which can translate to cost control advantages. Luckin is China\u2019s first coffee chain brand to achieve the milestone of operating more than 10,000 stores.Luckin also introduced an unconventional franchise model to seize market share. Shop and commercial property owners that are already working with other brands can opt to work with Luckin instead. There are certain requirements such as store locations, business licenses, and distance from pollution, that qualify a franchisee to adopt this model, but it is reported that 247 store applications have already been approved.Investing in promotions and expansion did not hinder profits, evidenced by a same-store sales growth rate of 20.8%, and a monthly transaction count of 43.07 million, as of Q2 2023. Luckin\u2019s operating profit margin reached 18.9%, with self-operated stores boasting a 29.1% profit margin.Luckin\u2019s robust expansion plan aligns with China\u2019s rapidly growing coffee market. An Analysys white paper forecasts a 25% annual compound growth rate in China\u2019s freshly ground coffee market by 2025, a rare high-growth avenue in the domestic consumer industry.In comparison, Starbucks, which adopts a fully self-operated model, added 237 stores in the same quarter, less than a fifth of Luckin\u2019s count. Starbucks currently has 6,480 stores in China and is projected to operate 9,000 stores nationwide by 2025.Additionally, according to Canyan Data, 47.67% of Starbucks\u2019 stores are located in shopping malls, while Luckin\u2019s presence in such locations stands at only 24.84%. Starbucks\u2019 average customer transaction price is RMB 38.81, while Luckin\u2019s is RMB 18.13.Recovering from its downfallSince its debut store at Beijing\u2019s Galaxy SOHO in October 2017, Luckin has dominated the domestic market in less than six years, thanks to its tripartite approach: burn money, offer subsidies, and expand rapidly.Utilizing promotional strategies like buy-two-get-one-free and peer-to-peer referrals, early-stage Luckin swiftly expanded under founder Zhengyao Lu\u2019s guidance, opening nearly 2,000 stores in a year, albeit at a substantial cost\u2014the company reported losses of RMB 1.6 billion and RMB 3.2 billion in 2018 and 2019 respectively.In April 2020, Luckin admitted to financial fraud, paying USD 180 million in penalties to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and announced its delisting, marking the end of this rapid growth phase with Lu stepping down.Following the settlement, Luckin entered into a new round of financing agreements worth USD 250 million. Centurium Capital contributed USD 240 million, increasing its ownership of Luckin to 17.2%, essentially putting them in control of the company. In July 2020, the company voted long-serving Luckin employee, Jinyi Guo, as the new CEO and chairman of the board.With the support of Centurium Capital, the new management team led by Guo achieved several things: reveal the facts, remove fraudulent employees, prioritize accountability, retain core talents, adjust development strategies, and transition Luckin toward a modern corporate governance system. Luckin subsequently created a new, digital-enabled business model with people, product, and location as the three main pillars.Guo was the first to introduce Luckin\u2019s strategy of crafting trendy products. From 2020 to 2022, Luckin launched three hits: \u201cMascarpone Cheese Latte,\u201d \u201cCoconut Latte,\u201d and \u201cCreamy Dreamy Latte,\u201d driving sales. Over 1.31 million cups of the latter were sold on its debut day, and 6.59 million cups had been sold by the end of the first week. Luckin tested products rapidly like an internet company, launching 77 new items in 2020, 113 in 2021, and 140 in 2022.Luckin\u2019s core business strategy centers on achieving cost efficiency, according to major shareholder Centurium Capital. This is accomplished by pricing its products within the RMB 20 range to maintain a healthy profit margin while appealing to consumers with superior product quality in comparison to competing alternatives in the same price category.Reducing costs through economies of scale also gives Luckin leverage in price wars, allowing it to hold off budget coffee rivals. Its RMB 9.9 promotion led to the sale of 39 million cups of coffee in the first week. This year, insiders revealed that each cup of coffee sold through the promotion is \u201cprofitable.\u201dStiff competitionAs of Q2 2023, 3,648 of Luckin\u2019s 10,836 stores are franchises, equivalent to 33.7%, up 2.7% from a year ago. Most of these stores are located in lower-tier markets. However, profit margins in these markets are significantly lower than in top-tier cities, with franchisees taking over two years to break even.Despite reporting strong financials this year, Luckin is struggling to produce new popular products. Its limited edition \u201cBiluochun Green Tea Latte,\u201d received mixed reviews on Weibo. \u201cThe tea is good, the coffee is good, but putting them together feels odd,\u201d said netizens on Weibo.Its evergreen \u201cCoconut Velvet Latte\u201d has also inspired other coffee and tea chain brands to follow suit, making coconut-themed drinks a standard offering in the market.In the latter half of 2023, well-known tea beverage brands, including Chagee and Mixue, announced plans to IPO and set up 10,000 stores. Most of them also sell coffee.According to Tianyancha, China has added 31,600 coffee-related firms so far this year, 70.81% more than the figure reported for the same period last year. Among its rivals, Cotti Coffee, led by Luckin founder and former chairman Zhengyao Lu, serves as the biggest threat, opening 3,000 stores in seven months, significantly faster than Luckin. Cotti Coffee\u2019s price war strategy is even more aggressive, selling a cup of \u201cpremium\u201d coffee for only RMB 8.8.",

The Netherlands exported a total of 2.6 billion litres of beer, accounting for 27% of the total EU beer exports.The Netherlands was followed by Belgium (1.6 billion litres; 17%), Germany (1.5 billion litres; 16%), Czechia (0.6 billion litres; 6%) and Ireland (0.4 billion litres; 5%).For imports, there was also no change compared with 2021, as France continued to be the largest importer of beer in 2022, with 0.9 billion litres, representing 17% of EU total imports. The other big importers were Italy with more than 0.7 billion litres (14%), Germany with less than 0.7 billion (12%), the Netherlands with 0.6 billion litres (11%) and Spain with 0.5 billion litres (10%).The biggest export destination for beer however, was the UK which snapped up 860 million litres of beer from the EU, equivalent to 21% of total EU beer exports. The Brits were closely followed by the US which snaffled 716 million litres of EU beer equal to around 18%followed by China (349 million litres; 9%), Russia (271 million litres; 7%), and Canada (155 million litres; 4%).Imports of beers containing alcohol from countries outside the EU are marginal compared to imports within the EU, the findings showed. Also, when importing from non-EU countries, EU countries typically favoured British beer (290 million litres equal to 57% of all EU imports of beer in 2022). Also popular in the EU was Mexican beer (99 million litres; 19% respectively) followed by Serbia (40 million litres; 8%), Ukraine (15 million; 3%) and China (11 million; 2%) which were all top import partners but with much smaller values.",

The standard deviation of yields is 0.76 (n=236).The current dividend yield is 0.85 standard deviations below the historical average.Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 2.19. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.The company has not increased its dividend in the last three years.What is the Fund Sentiment?There are 1115 funds or institutions reporting positions in Diageo plc - ADR.

            "description": "(Yicai) Aug. 4 -- China\u2019s imports of rice halved in the first six months from the same period last year as the price soars on the global market and many countries introduce export bans. Given that the cost is unlikely to fall significantly, the country\u2019s imports of the grain will remain depressed in the second half, experts said.In the first half, China imported 1.8 million tons of rice, a drop of 49.6 percent from the same period last year, according to the latest data. But the price surged 33 percent over the period to CNY3,603 (USD501) per ton.China has an abundant supply of rice and imported varieties are now much more expensive than homegrown ones. The wholesale price of early indica rice in Guangdong was CNY3,710 (USD516) per ton as of June 28, while the arrival prices of rice imported from Thailand, Vietnam, and Pakistan were CNY4,307 (USD600), CNY4,188, and CNY4,037 per ton respectively.The international price of rice has been on the rise since July last year. The FOB export price of rice from Thailand surged 40 percent on Aug. 1 from a year earlier to USD572 per ton, while that from Vietnam jumped 30 percent to USD545 per ton, according to the National Grain and Oils Information Center. They are both now the highest they have been in a decade.In order to rein in runaway prices and ensure domestic supply, many countries, such as India, the United Arab Emirates and Russia, have started to ban rice exports. The world's second and third largest rice exporters, Thailand and Vietnam, have yet to do so.Most of China's rice imports are from Vietnam, followed by Myanmar, Thailand, India and Pakistan. India used to be the biggest exporter to China, but after the export curbs were introduced, it slipped to fourth place, accounting for 38 percent of imports.But imports of polished rice, which is almost as popular as domestic rice in some parts of the country, are expected to stay stable, said Zheng Wenhui, a grain economy researcher at the Guangdong South China Grain Exchange Center. After years of development, certain varieties of rice from countries such as Vietnam, Thailand, and Pakistan have become staple foods in Guangdong.Companies are likely to continue to import rice, even if the cost is high, although the quantity may be reduced, Zheng said. However, if the price remains significantly higher than that of homegrown rice, they may need to consider adjusting their sources of supply.Editor: Kim Taylor",

            "description": "Tailing just closely behind Mo\u00ebt & Chandon, China's biggest winery Changyu is named the world's second most valuable wine brand in 2023.China\u2019s biggest winery Changyu Pioneer Wine Company has emerged as a major player in the global wine brand ranking, posing a strong challenge to the long-standing champion, Mo\u00ebt & Chandon.According to the latest Brand Finance Alcoholic Drinks 2023 report, an annual report on the most valuable and strongest alcoholic drinks brands, Mo\u00ebt & Chandon retains its title as the world\u2019s most valuable wine brand, with a brand valuation of US$ 1.3 billion, despite experiencing a 10% decrease in value.However, the biggest revelation came with Changyu\u2019s impressive rise in the rankings. The Chinese wine brand, one of the biggest wine producers by volume, leaped two positions to secure the second spot with a brand value of US$1.2 billion, marking a remarkable 33% growth.Founded in 1892, Changyu dominates China\u2019d domestic wine market with close to 50% market share. Changyu\u2019s unexpected surge is attributed to the massive and rapidly growing market for domestically produced Chinese wine, which has significantly boosted the brand\u2019s value. Consumption of domestic wines in China is projected to reach US$19.5 billion in 2022, compared with US$16.5 billion, based on a 2021 IWSR/Vinexpo report.Following Changyu, US Chandon came in third at US$1 billion valuation, ahead of Veuve Clicquot, Dom Perignon, Barefoot Wine, Penfolds, Beringer, Concha y Toro and Jacob\u2019s Creek.Henry Farr, Associate Director at Brand Finance, noted that high-end Champagne this year have taken a hit in ranking. \u201cDifficult growing conditions, reduced availability and price hikes have steered some consumers towards lower-end sparkling wines as an alternative. For those less effected by harsher financial situations, this could be due to not wanting to appear vulgar or ostentatious by indulging in luxury products when others are struggling with the rising costs of living,\u201d he explained.Aside from ranking as second most valuable wine brand, Changyu was named \u201cthe strongest wine brand in 2023\u201d by Brand Finance after it earned an impressive BSI score of 83.2 out of 100, securing a AAA- rating. This distinction is attributed to the brand\u2019s consistent growth in brand strength over three consecutive years.The scoring was reached after evaluating a set of metrics including marketing investment, stakeholder equity, and business performance. Compliant with ISO 20671, Brand Finance\u2019s assessment of stakeholder equity incorporates original market research data from over 100,000 respondents in 38 countries and across 31 sectors.Despite its rise in valuation, China\u2019s biggest wine producer pales in comparison with the country\u2019s most known Baijiu producer Kweichow Moutai, whose market valuation stands over US$2.3 trillion.Meanwhile, Penfolds, an Australian-based brand, emerged as the fastest-growing Wine & Champagne brand this year, experiencing a remarkable 48% increase in brand value, reaching US$ 659 million. The brand also earned the second-highest strength rating in the category, with a BSI of 81.6 out of 100, and an AAA- rating.Penfolds\u2018 success can be attributed to its consumer-centric approach, driven by embracing new technologies and innovation. The brand\u2019s 2022 wine collection, which expanded beyond Australian-made wines to include French and Californian wines, played a pivotal role in enhancing global brand awareness and market share. This strategic move led to significant improvements in brand value and strength.Additionally, Penfolds\u2019 commitment to sustainability was recognized, as the collection aimed to alleviate pressures on regions with harsher climates and reduced crop yields. This earned the brand a Sustainability Perceptions Score of 4.59 out of 10, positioning it third in the ranking based on this metric.Like this: Like Loading...",

A Shede Spirits subiu mais de 4%, Kweichow Moutai e Shanxi Fen Wine subiram mais de 3%, Shunxin Agriculture, Gujing Gongjiu, entre outros, subiram mais de 2%.Embora a ind\u00fastria de bebidas alco\u00f3licas tenha sido afetada por v\u00e1rios fatores adversos, a maioria das empresas de bebidas ainda manteve um crescimento de dois d\u00edgitos. Como empresas l\u00edderes de bebidas alco\u00f3licas com distribui\u00e7\u00e3o nacional, Kweichow Moutai e Shanxi Fen Wine anunciaram recentemente dados operacionais do primeiro semestre, mostrando que a receita e o lucro l\u00edquido ambos cresceram dois d\u00edgitos.Os dados divulgados pela Kweichow Moutai mostram que, no primeiro semestre de 2023, a empresa espera alcan\u00e7ar uma receita total de cerca de 70,6 bilh\u00f5es de yuans (dos quais a receita de vendas do Moutai foi de cerca de 59,1 bilh\u00f5es de yuans, e a receita de vendas de vinhos da s\u00e9rie foi de cerca de 9,9 bilh\u00f5es de yuans), um aumento de cerca de 18,8% em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao mesmo per\u00edodo do ano anterior.Em contraste com o crescimento est\u00e1vel das empresas l\u00edderes, o desempenho de algumas empresas de bebidas alco\u00f3licas de m\u00e9dio e baixo padr\u00e3o n\u00e3o \u00e9 muito otimista. A Jinniu Liquor espera que o lucro l\u00edquido atribu\u00eddo aos acionistas da empresa listada no primeiro semestre seja de -32 milh\u00f5es a -48 milh\u00f5es de yuans.Desde o in\u00edcio do ano, devido ao impacto do ambiente econ\u00f4mico e do ambiente de consumo, houve uma diferencia\u00e7\u00e3o estrutural evidente no consumo b\u00e1sico de bebidas alco\u00f3licas, e a situa\u00e7\u00e3o de involu\u00e7\u00e3o ocorreu em diferentes graus nos lados da oferta e demanda.

            "description": "France star Wendie Renard was injured in her first appearance of this Women's World Cup and her status is now in question for an important match against Brazil. Renard was injured during France's underwhelming 0-0 draw against Jamaica, and although she played the entire 90 minutes in the opener, she was believed to be hurt in second-half stoppage time in a tackle that earned Khadija Shaw a second yellow card of the game. The France captain trained with her squad ahead of Saturday's match in Brisbane, but if she can't play, Les Bleues could be in big trouble in Group F. Brazil romped to a 4-0 win over Panama in its opener behind a hat trick from Ary Borges and are holding strong as the group leaders. France, which is ranked No. 5 in the world, had few good scoring chances against the 43rd-ranked Jamaicans. But coach Herve Renard was pragmatic about the team's challenges.\u201cThere are lots of people, lots of teams that start with the fanfare and are not there come the final, and others are maybe slow to get out of the starting blocks,\u201d he said.A loss to Brazil could potentially lead to France's elimination after the group stage, something the French have avoided since 2003. France did not qualify in 2007, but advanced out of its group in the last three World Cups.The French are undefeated against Brazil in 11 matches, with six victories and five draws.Brazil, which is ranked eighth in the world, would be guaranteed a spot in the knockout round with a victory Saturday. Brazil has advanced to the knockout stage in the last six Women's World Cups, but has never won the trophy. Brazil played in the 2007 final but lost 2-0 to champions Germany. Brazil star Marta, playing in her sixth and final World Cup, is trying to make history as the first player \u2014 male or female \u2014 to score in six tournaments. She's already the all-time leading scorer in the Women's World Cup with 17 goals.She came off the bench against Panama. SWEDEN-ITALY The third-ranked team in the world opened the Women's World Cup with a monstrous scare when Sweden needed a goal in the 90th minute for a 2-1 win over South Africa.The Swedes next play a Group G match against Italy on Saturday in Wellington and this game should be even tougher than Sweden's first opponent. Italy beat Argentina to open the tournament, but needed a goal in the 87th minute to secure its 1-0 victory. Sweden defender Jonna Andersson expects Italy, ranked 16th, to be a completely different opponent than the South African squad that troubled the Swedes.\u201cSouth Africa was really strong in the counter-attacks with fast strikers, and now we're going to face Italy, that's maybe a more technically good team and they maybe press a little bit higher in defense,'' said Andersson, who insisted Sweden never panicked when South Africa struck first. \u201cWe as a team are so strong and I could feel that we had the feeling and the trust in the team that we could change the momentum and change the game,\u201d she said. ''And finally, we scored two goals and we won the game. So I think we had a good feeling even if they scored the first goal, (we had) the feeling that we could change it and that we could win.\u201d Sweden has had to overcome some injuries as Fridolina Rolfo has been recovering from a knee injury, and then was ill ahead of the South Africa match. Although she scored the equalizer in the opening match, she was substituted midway through the second half.Amanda Ilestedt played the entire match and scored the game-winner despite a thigh injury, but fellow defender Linda Sembrant did not play. Sweden star player Caroline Seger has been plagued by calf injuries and came off the bench against South Africa. Italy is healthy and features 16-year-old Giulia Dragoni, who is nicknamed \u201cLittle Messi.\u201d She's been lauded for her passing and ability to stay out of trouble on the field. She said she's ready to take Italy through the group stage, despite her young age. \u201cI don't feel any pressure because I know my value,'' she said. ''People know me. I'm very confident and patient.\u201d PANAMA-JAMAICA Jamaica scored its first competition point in Women's World Cup history when it played France to a scoreless draw in its opening Group F game. Now the Reggae Girlz play Panama with a chance of collecting their first win in the global tournament.Panama, one of eight teams playing in the Women's World Cup for the first time, lost its opening match 4-0 to Brazil. Panama is still trying to figure out its identity after reeling off 10 wins in 14 games, only to lose its next three matches by a combined score of 16-0 against superior talent. Las Canaleras will drop out of contention for spot in the knockout round if they lose to Jamaica in the Saturday game scheduled to be played in Perth, Western Australia state. Jamaica played above its level against France and did not concede a goal even when it was down to 10 players following Khadija Shaw's late red card. Shaw, the leading scorer for Jamaica, will miss the game because of the red card against France. Jamaica could move Cheyne Matthews into the front two.(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

            "description": "(Yicai Global) July 26 -- The net inflow of northbound capital into the Chinese mainland stock market through the China-Hong Kong Stock Connect reached CNY19 billion (USD2.7 billion) yesterday, the highest since December 2021.The net inflow was also the sixth-highest recorded since the launch of the northbound leg of the stock connect program that links the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses with that in Hong Kong.The daily record was set the day after the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China suggested to \u201cactivate capital markets\u201d with a view to boosting investor sentiment. All three major stock indexes in the mainland climbed over 2 percent yesterday, with the Shanghai Composite Index gaining 2.13 percent to 3,231.The stocks of firms in communications, autos, home appliances, real estate, and media were the ones offshore capital flowed into the most last week, according to Wind Information.The most-bought stock was Kweichow Moutai [SHA: 600519]. Some CNY3.9 billion (USD544.9 million) of the liquor maker\u2019s shares were snapped up last week. Ranking second to fifth were financial data platform East Money Information [SHE: 300059], distiller Wuliangye Yibin [SHE: 000858], new energy vehicle giant BYD [SHE: 002594], and insurance and financial company Ping An Insurance Group [SHA: 601318].Many foreign-funded institutions recently released their investment outlook for the global and Chinese markets for the second half of the year. UBS analysts anticipate a 10 percent increase in the earnings of firms listed on Chinese stock markets, given that stock prices have already factored in the second quarter\u2019s economic slowdown and the expected recovery over the next six months.If government policies are moderate, UBS has a positive outlook on some sectors indirectly related to real estate, such as home appliances, food, and beverages, Meng Lei, a China equity strategist at UBS Securities, said at a press conference yesterday. Meng also recommended insurance and utilities firms as defensive stocks.The price-to-earnings ratio of the Morgan Stanley Capital International China Index is only a little over nine times, which is low for the past six or seven years, Wang Ying, chief market strategist at Morgan Stanley China, told Yicai Global last month.The MSCI China Index has a 20 percent discount on the valuation of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. \u201cNo matter the absolute or relative valuation, China\u2019s stock market is attractive,\u201d Wang noted. \u201cIt is unreasonable to go short on Chinese stocks or expect a sharp decline in China\u2019s stock market with the current market prices.\u201dEditor: Futura Costaglione",

            "description": "NewsBy Arabella MilehamA quick check of the wines in the Liv-ex Power 100 would suggest that many of the world\u2019s top wines on the secondary market are now organic. Arabella Mileham asks what is driving this trend, and if organic is becoming a prerequisite for fine wine.According to French fine wine auctioneer iDealwine\u2019s recent annual Barometer, organic and biodynamic wine has also been \u201cthriving\u201d at auction over the past few years, with the rankings of the most expensive organic and biodynamic wines at auction bearing a \u201cstriking resemblance to the overall rankings of the highest-priced wines in 2022\u201d, particularly at the top of the list.It showed that 15 of the top 20 highest-selling wines at auction in the Barometer came from Burgundy, along with two from Bordeaux (Ch\u00e2teau Palmer and Ch\u00e2teau Latour), however this the data reflects the growing demand for Burgundy rather than a specific consumer-led demand for organic wines \u2013 particularly as the region is by no means the largest or the most advanced in terms of organic production.As iDealwine\u2019s co-founder Ang\u00e9lique de Lencquesaing notes, this trend \u201cdoes seem to be more producer-driven\u201d, with a raft of high-end producers moving to organic production and many top producers, such as Leroy, Ch\u00e2teau Latour, and Domaine de la Roman\u00e9e-Conti becoming certified as organic.For example, in June, Burgundy\u2019s Maison Joseph Drouhin, which is aiming to be fully certified by 2028, announced it had started to convert the recently acquired Ch\u00e2teau de Chasselas in Saint-V\u00e9ran to organic viticulture, while St \u00c9milion grand cru Ch\u00e2teau Fleur Cardinale in Burgundy is also undergoing conversion, and is expected to be fully certified organic by 2024. The Vranken-Pommery group in Champagne is in the process of converting, while Champagne Telmont announced its aim to convert 100% of its cultivated areas, comprising both its own 24.5- hectare Telmont Estate vineyards (of which 72% is already certified) as well as those of its partner winegrowers, to organic agriculture by 2031.Champagne Telmont\u2019s president, Ludovic du Plessis, explains that while converting Telmont\u2019s own estate to organic was relatively simple, the challenge facing all Champagne producers lies in persuading grower partners who supply grapes to also go organic as well, making it easier for up and coming grower Champagnes to do, given their control over their own supply. This is evidenced by the number of the top grower champagnes that are already organic, such as Cedric Bouchard, Ulysse Colin, and Frederic Savart, along with larger icons such as Louis Roederer \u2019s Cristal, and Leclerq Briant\u2019s Abyss.But this also highlights a truism in that there is huge variation between wine-growing regions, with individual regions and producers facing very different climatic challenges when it comes to the implementing organic practices.\u201cFor example, Burgundy is a region where the quality of terroir and microclimates makes up a great deal of the demand, yet organic production was still only found on 15% of the surface area as of 2020,\u201d de Lencquesaing explains, whereas \u201cin Provence organic vineyards already represented over 43% of the total surface area.\u201d\u201cBurgundy\u2019s climate presents more challenges throughout the growing season than that of Provence, which helps explain the difference,\u201d she says.For many organic producers, organic viticulture is synonymous with the idea of quality. Spanish wine producer Artadi sees the terroir as inextricably linked to soil health, and farming organically is key to this. As export manager Ana Rodr\u00edguez says: \u201cOrganic is not an argument, it is a must. If you want to get the profile and character of the wine, to have the possibility of a wine with respect, and to have \u2018honest\u2019 wines, then growing on an organic basis is a must.\u201dOthers, such as Olivia Bodle, global head of events at wine investment company Cult Wines, see more nuance in the argument. \u201cI think that organic doesn\u2019t necessarily equal premium,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are other things which winemakers are doing which are much better for the environment, using products that they are still allowed to be used with organic certification. It\u2019s not necessarily making the biggest impact on the environment.\u201d\u201cFor example, Ch\u00e2teau Cheval Blanc employs agro-forestry practices in its vineyard, which involves planting trees and bushes among the vines, which can have a positive impact on the water, climate and quality of the soil,\u201d de Lencquesaing agrees.At its most basic definition, organic production means the strict adherence of eschewing chemical fertilisers, pesticides, herbicides, or fungicides, however the ethos tends to fit into the broader philosophy of sustainable agriculture, with a commitment to eradicate monocultures and introduce more regenerative farming practices including cover crops, hedges, and increasing biodiversity. \u201cThat is a huge step in the right direction,\u201d Bodle argues. \u201cIt would be difficult to find a high-quality winemaker that does not take environmental concerns into account during the production of its wines.\u201dIt is perhaps this complexity that makes some merchants and fine wine platforms apparently reluctant to build organic search facilities into their online platforms. The websites of Cult Wines, Bordeaux Index, Berry Bros. & Rudd and BBX, or Liv-ex, for example, do not have the option for consumers to search explicitly for organic wines.\u201cIf you tried to buy only organic wine through Cult Wines, I think that you\u2019d find it very difficult. The information is out there but determining the accuracy, and how accessible it is, is very challenging,\u201d Bodle admits. \u201cIt\u2019s very much on a region-by-region basis.\u201d\u201cAnd where do we draw the line? Do they count as an organic producer because they\u2019ve been following these principles for 15 years? Or do you only count the ones who have the certificate as a \u2018bona fide\u2019 organic producer?\u201d she questions.Bodle cites Ch\u00e2teau Montrose in Saint-Est\u00e8phe, which is in the process of converting to organic, noting that there is no mention of the word \u2018organic\u2019 on the producer \u2019s profile, and out of 10 critics\u2019 reviews, only James Suckling mentioned organic grapes. \u201cThe organic movement is very much being led by the producers in Bordeaux, and if merchants and critics aren\u2019t mentioning it, then it\u2019s not being passed on to consumers and it\u2019s not on the radar of people who are buying wines en primeur.\u201d\u201cBut does converting to organic make the wines any better, or are producers already making the very best wine and they\u2019ve just added another string to their bow?\u201dWith such a layered debate around organics at the top end of the wine market, it seems likely that where the producers lead, the consumer will followed. As iDealwine concludes: \u201cWhen it comes to dealing with the wines that attract the highest prices, organic or even biodynamic production methods are somewhat of a prerequisite.\u201dOrganic producers in the Liv-ex Power 100\u2022 Domaine Leroy, Burgundy \u2013 farmed organically and biodynamically from the start and now certified by Ecocert.\u2022 Domaine Arnoux-Lachaux, Burgundy, C\u00f4te de Nuits \u2013 has used an organic and biodynamic approach to farming since around 2000. It has been certified since 2016.\u2022 Domaine Leflaive, Puligny-Montrachet: grands crus are cultivated biodynamically, premiers crus and villages organically, without certification, because it \u201cdoesn\u2019t hesitate to make a chemical treatment if necessary\u201d.\u2022 Domaine Armand Rousseau, Gevrey-Chambertin, C\u00f4te de Nuits \u2013 is noted for its dedication to organic farming and sustainable practices, which include using wild rather than cultivated yeasts.\u2022 Domaine Prieur\u00e9 Roch \u2013 \u201cdoes not use any synthetic product in the vineyard (biodynamics) or in winemaking\u201d but is not certified organic.\u2022 Dom P\u00e9rignon \u2013 while neither organic or biodynamic, the Champagne house is reportedly making changes to work towards organic certification, including halting its use of herbicides.\u2022 Louis Roederer \u2013 the Champagne house began biodynamic farming in 2000, and by 2021 more than half of its estates were certified as organic. 2012 was the first vintage of flagship cuv\u00e9e Cristal to be produced entirely from biodynamically-grown grapes (though is not certified as such).\u2022 Domaine De la Roman\u00e9e-Conti \u2013 Since 1985, this Burgundy icon has practised organic farming in the vineyard, certifying as organic and biodynamic. Traditional winemaking methods are used, including the use of only natural yeasts.This was an extract of the organic feature in the July issue of The Drinks Business",

            "description": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 50 most valuable companies in the world by market cap. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the most valuable industries, you can go directly to 10 Most Valuable Companies in the World by Market Cap.The most valuable companies in the world operate within various industries, including technology, energy, healthcare, financial services, and communication services. It is important to note that some of the technology and energy companies are listed as the biggest companies in the world by market cap. Many of these biggest companies have had to deal with a number of hurdles in the past few years, such as recessionary fears, overcoming the COVID-19 crisis, needs and demands of the employees, and the consequences of the war in Ukraine.In one of our previous articles, 25 largest energy companies by market cap, we discussed how the Russian invasion of Ukraine caused the global supply of fossil fuels to fall and demand to rise significantly, causing oil prices to surge. However, according to an article published by CNBC on March 3, new data shows that the war in Ukraine has actually helped the US oil and gas industry as the US became one of the biggest energy-exporting countries. The US exported an average ten million barrels a day during the four-week period, which ended on February 24.In addition to the energy sector, the information technology industry also ranks among the biggest industries in the world. In fact, some of the most valuable companies in our list, such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), all belong to the technology sector. Let's discuss what the future of the technology industry looks like before we move on to the most valuable companies in the world in terms of market cap.The Information Technology Sector on Track to Hit $12 Trillion By 2027Previously, the information technology industry had been subjected to supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 crisis. While the supply chain disruptions are back due to the Russia-Ukraine war, the industry is expected to continue growing in the long term. The information technology market was valued above $8.85 trillion in 2023, according to Research and Markets. The industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.9% from 2023 through 2027, to reach a value of around $11.99 trillion by the end of the forecasted period.Story continuesThe technology industry has become one of the biggest industries in the world and has also perhaps been the most consequential over the last couple of decades. In the modern day, technology has changed the way we live our lives and consumer demand for more technology continues to rise.As an obvious consequence, technology companies rank among the most valuable companies in the world in terms of market cap. According to an article posted by Reuters on July 1, the market cap for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reached above the $3 trillion mark for the first time. This milestone follows the company\u2019s launch of a mixed-reality headset.Moreover, the rising demand for tools powered by artificial intelligence as well as cloud computing services is expected to help boost the profits for technology companies. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) appreciates the potential of both AI and cloud services as they offer their products and services, including Microsoft Azure which is their cloud computing platform, to some of the biggest enterprises around the world. Here are some comments from the company\u2019s Q3 2023 earnings call:\u201cWe continue to focus on three priorities. First, helping customers use the breadth and depth of the Microsoft Cloud to get the most value out of their digital spend. Second, investing to lead in the new AI wave across our solution areas and expanding our TAM. And third, driving operating leverage, aligning our cost structure with our revenue growth. Now I'll highlight examples of our progress, starting with infrastructure. Azure took share as customers continue to choose our ubiquitous computing fabric from cloud to edge, especially as every application becomes AI-powered. We have the most powerful AI infrastructure and it\u2019s being used by our partner, OpenAI, as well as NVIDIA and leading AI start-ups like Adept and Inflection to train large models. Our Azure OpenAI Service brings together advanced models, including ChatGPT and GPT-4 with the enterprise capabilities of Azure. From Coursera and Grammarly to Mercedes-Benz and Shell, we now have more than 2,500 Azure OpenAI Service customers, up 10x quarter-over-quarter. Just last week, Epic Systems shared that it was using Azure OpenAI Service to integrate the next generation of AI with its industry-leading EHR software. Azure also powers OpenAI API and we are pleased to see brands like Shopify and Snap use the API to integrate OpenAI's models. More broadly, we continue to see the world's largest enterprises migrate key workloads to our cloud. Unilever, for example, went all in on Azure this quarter in one of the largest ever cloud migrations in the consumer goods industry. IKEA Retail, ING Bank, Rabobank, Telstra and Wolverine Worldwide, all use Azure Arc to run Azure services across on-premises, edge and multi-cloud environments. We now have more than 15,000 Azure Arc customers, up over 150% year-over-year. And we are extending our infrastructure to 5G network edge with Azure for Operators. We are the cloud of choice for telcos, and at MWC last month, AT&T, Deutsche Telekom, Singtel and Telefonica all shared how they are using our infrastructure to modernize and monetize their networks.\u201dOn February 8, Reuters had reported that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) will be rolling out an AI chatbot to operate alongside Bing's search results, as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) seeks to challenge Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google in search and browser technology.The AI war got ignited when Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) made a hefty $10 billion investment in OpenAI, the company we all know from ChatGPT.While Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google was previously at a disadvantage with regards to generative AI, but favorable demand trends for AI tools caused the company to take a big step forward. On May 12, Forbes reported that Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google had announced that their AI chatbot \u201cBard\u201d is open to all and that the users will soon experience a completely new \u201csearch generation experience\u201d.On July 25, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) posted market-beating earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $1.44 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.10. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $74.60 billion, up 7.06% year over year and ahead of Wall Street consensus by $1.85 billion.Now that we have discussed what's been happening in one of the most valuable industries in the world, let's take a look at some of the most valuable companies in the world, by market cap.50 Most Valuable Companies in the World by Market CapCopyright: yuliufu / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodologyFor this article, we will be looking at the most valuable companies in the world in terms of market cap.

            "description": "So far, though, nothing on the ground has changed . Of course, now we have come out of travel restrictions and closed-loop factories \u2013 where staff lived in their workplaces \u2013 things are moving in the right direction, but at a very slow speed. Our members always talk about promise fatigue. When can we have more market access? Can we have more exports into China? Last year, China sent 6.4 million containers to Europe, but we only shipped 1.6 million containers to China, and overall, the EU sold only 23% more to China than we sold to Switzerland. That imbalance is problematic for us.European investment into China stumblingEuropean investment in China was around $9 billion last year, which looks good \u2013 the best ever. But if you take one deal out \u2013 BMW\u2019s acquisition of local car-maker Brilliance in Shenyang for 4.2bn euros \u2013 our investment actually went down. And we haven\u2019t really seen any significant commitments beyond the three areas where there has always been big investment \u2013 chemicals, cars, and machinery. So, we\u2019re still in a \u2018wait and see\u2019 situation. But China doesn\u2019t have that much time left. Companies are looking elsewhere.Derisking over decouplingAll the same, decoupling is impossible, as EU President Ursula von der Leyen has said, and I\u2019m grateful she has made that point very clearly. But derisking is something we need to learn from China. It started derisking 20 years ago when it pushed out foreign internet companies. Behind the Great Firewall, Chinese companies built up their own capabilities and did very well.During COVID, we learned how dependent we were on Chinese pharmaceutical precursors and that China might threaten to cut us off from rare earths. We also have a tremendous dependency on its magnesium and vitamin B1. These items are of not much value, but China supplies 80-90% of our needs. It\u2019s prudent to see where we are excessively exposed. As the European Commission said in April 2019, we are partners as well as competitors and rivals, so we need to be in touch. That\u2019s why I\u2019m grateful when our leaders come here. But we should not kid ourselves that relations are good.Fading optimismWe\u2019ve made it clear what we want. We put 967 assessments and recommendations into our annual report \u2013 for legislation, for opening up customs, for opening equity possibilities. But will China do this? I don\u2019t know. I have had good meetings with local and regional leaders and again in Beijing, but nothing changes.",

            "description": "Learn to live with the tensions between China and the US.A recalibration of the power balance between China and the US has been underway for a long time, and the end is not yet in sight. Companies and organizations need to find a new balance in this dynamic rather than choosing sides. As the recent field trip by the JPMorgan CEO to Shanghai seems to suggest, leaders around the world need to learn to live with tensions. The interdependencies between these economies and the rest of the world are simply too costly to unravel.Understand, urgently, how political and business decisions are made in China.The need to build bridges by deepening our understanding of how political and business decisions are made in China has never been more urgent. With a two-decade low in the number of exchange students visiting China and the general rhetoric of decoupling, we are embarking on a decade of limited understanding. In 2023, only 400 American exchange students entered China, and many Chinese students are reconsidering their overseas studies. This trend does not bode well, so new ways to build bridges should be sought.Keep in mind that the next China is innovative China.Oversimplified and often politized discussions around semiconductors, TikTok's algorithms, and other technological issues are preventing many global leaders from seeing the substantial wave of new tech advancements, business models, and management approaches emerging from Chinese companies. Numerous companies, such as Mindray, Hikvision, Amer, Luxshare, and AAC Technologies, are global champions in their respective fields. (If you don\u2019t already know them, look them up!) Firms such as Midea, Handu, Haier, and Alibaba are not merely innovating in terms of technology and products but are also reinventing management approaches. It is essential to focus on these champions of innovation for learning and collaboration. In fact, the last company I mentioned above, Alibaba, is a fascinating case to study. In its recent restructuring, each of the company\u2019s six business groups now has its own chief executive and board of directors. In May, chief executive Daniel Zhang laid out specific plans for separate stock market listings for three of the six over the next 18 months. Raising capital from outside investors is one way to help the businesses adapt to the country\u2019s dynamic consumer market, cutthroat competition, and other pressing issues, as its rival JD.com did.Include China and its technology and business acumen in your sustainability discussions.The transition to greater sustainability that many countries around the world have embarked upon depends on access to technology and business from China. The field of new energy is largely dominated by Chinese companies, which not only develop technologies but also bring them to commercial scale, at a cost level that makes the energy transition manageable. Both US and European leaders have acknowledged this, while at the same time struggling politically with the idea of limiting dependencies on Chinese technologies. As such, it's of utmost importance to put China at the center of the sustainability discussion.Rethink strategies, opportunities, and risks for multinationals in China.In a multipolar world, China remains an economy brimming with both old and new opportunities. Multinational corporations have enjoyed a relatively long period of growth. However, these times are changing, and global companies need to reconsider their opportunities and risks. The largest risk remains the competitive edge of Chinese companies, while political risk has significantly increased. Perhaps a simple decision to \u201cstay or go\u201d is not productive. Clearly, for some sectors \u2013 like cars, luxury, and industrial equipment, where China comprises 25-40% of the global market \u2013 this question is not even up for debate. Not being present in China may pose the biggest risk for multinationals\u2019 competitive position in overseas markets, such as Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, where Chinese companies are gaining ground rapidly.",

The debate has raged since on both sides of the world as to whether the ruling was in the \u201cspirit of the game\u201d.It has caused ire in Australia and its national press, after former controversies involving the England team where they benefited from debatable decisions, and resulted in numerous images and memes of England cricketers as crying babies.That\u2019s definitely not me, since when did I bowl with the new ball https://t.co/24wI5GzohD \u2014 Ben Stokes (@benstokes38) July 3, 2023According to Victoria Bitter, the beer being sent will be a \u201cnew Big Warm Beer for our old English foes\u201d, and Australian fans will also be able to pick-up \u2018English Bitter\u2019 tee-shirts at Headingley during the current third Ashes test.A note with the beers reads: \u201cYou can get it not protecting your stumps, you can get it ignoring the umps \u2013 Victoria Bitter for the English.\u201dIt follows England head coach and New Zealander Brendon McCullum \u2013 the creator of the infamous \u2018Bazball\u2019 aggressive-stroke-playing method of cricket \u2013 stating he was so upset by the Australian team\u2019s decision to not reverse the Bairstow stumping that he said he wouldn\u2019t share the traditional beers with the Australian team at the end of the test.Speaking about the move, VB marketing manager, Marc Lord, said: \u201cWe know the English are bitter about the Lord\u2019s Test, but when they\u2019re feeling less bitter we\u2019ve got a beer to shout them\u2026 our fresh new England Bitter.\u201d\u201cEngland Bitter has got their name on it and we\u2019re sending a few slabs to the English Cricket Team to enjoy once they\u2019ve cooled off.\u201cWe raise our glass to the whole Australian team for securing a famous win in the second test and wish them the best of luck in winning the series.\u201dThe brand has even re-recorded its famous jingle to include the \u2018English Bitter\u2019 line.You can get it getting stumped.You can get it complaining to the umps.You can get it throwing away your wicketYou can get it invoking the spirit of cricketYou get it if your Ben Stokes You can get it if you\u2019re the coach./i>Yes our beer may be bitter.

Rising wages in Japan will likely boost consumption while a weakening yen may help draw in more tourists from abroad, she said.The South Korean fund had been bullish on China until earlier this year, but it has shifted its views because of sluggish consumer spending and insufficient policy support that are making the country take longer than expected to recover, Yoo said.",

            "description": "(Yicai Global) July 5 -- China\u2019s southwestern province of Sichuan aims to create a world-class premium baijiu industry cluster, according to a recently published policy document, in a bid to better compete with Guizhou province-based producers such as Kweichow Moutai.Sichuan intends to consolidate and enhance the quality and reputation of Sichuan-made baijiu and increase the share of locally produced liquors worldwide, the document said without providing much detail.The province, which mainly produces strong-aroma baijiu, has introduced policies to support the development of the industry almost every year since 2015. Some encouraged financial institutions to increase fixed-income investment in baijiu makers and enhanced the set up of local brands.Sichuan\u2019s baijiu industry is not small, but faces fierce competition from Guizhou\u2019s Jiang-flavor Chinese spirit makers, especially Kweichow Moutai, Luo Ling, dean of Sichuan\u2019s provincial economy research institute, told Yicai Global.Sichuan boasts six renowned baijiu brands -- Wuliangye Yibin, Jiannanchun, Luzhou Laojiao, Langjiu, Quanxing, and Tuopai -- but they lack coordination, Luo noted. Wuliangye should be promoted to become the province\u2019s leading player and take on Kweichow Moutai, he added.Guizhou\u2019s produced more than CNY140 billion (USD19.3 billion) of the popular Jiang-flavor spirits last year. The industry\u2019s revenue and net profit in Guizhou reached CNY125.2 billion and CNY97.5 billion (USD13.5 billion), accounting for about 19 percent and 44 percent, respectively, of the country\u2019s total.Sichuan makes a little more than half of China\u2019s strong-aroma baijiu, with its baijiu industry\u2019s revenue and profit making up 52 percent and 34 percent, respectively, of the national total.Editors: Zhang Yushuo, Futura Costaglione",

            "description": "Last month, Beijing launched China\u2019s first metaverse patent pool, allowing enterprises and academic institutions to cross-license technologies related to the emerging sector.The project \u2013 part of the capital\u2019s ambition to attract more than 100 metaverse enterprises by the end of 2024 \u2013 includes about 170 metaverse-related patents so far. But Beijing is one of many Chinese cities that aims to become a hub of digital world technologies.In October last year, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued a three-year plan for China\u2019s \u201cindustrial metaverse\u201d making the technology part of a national strategy to build a digital economy that complements its current economy, which at US$18 trillion is second only to the U.S.The government of Beijing issued a Web 3.0 whitepaper on May 27, which includes plans to develop the metaverse industry. Image: Envato ElementsChina\u2019s interest in the metaverse primarily lies in its benefits to real-world industries, said Deng Jian-peng, a fintech law specialist and law professor at the Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing.\u201cAn example (of metaverse\u2019s usage in legacy industries) could be BMW\u2019s industrial metaverse built by [Artificial Intelligence leader] Nvidia, which provides a digital replica of BMW\u2019s production line so that the automobile maker can test and optimize its performance at lower costs,\u201d said Deng.Metaverse with China characteristicsEarlier in January, China\u2019s financial capital Shanghai unveiled 20 metaverse use cases it plans to develop by the end of 2025. They range from a virtual replica of a state-owned steel plant to a metaverse hospital for patients to receive remote diagnosis.Illustrating the government\u2019s focus, not a single use case seeks to build open metaverse games, such as Decentraland and Sandbox.Zhao Xing, a professor at the Institute of Big Data at Shanghai\u2019s Fudan University, reiterated the point that China\u2019s metaverse projects focus on real-world scenarios.\u201cFundamentally, China aims to use the metaverse to solve the issues in the existing technologies, industries and administrations,\u201d Zhao said.\u201cAfter missing the [earlier] opportunities in the internet, mobile web and artificial intelligence, China\u2019s regional governments are striving for leadership in the metaverse, which is still at its early stage and undetermined.\u201dOn the corporate side, \u201cthe adoption of the metaverse in real-world use cases may grant legacy industries an opportunity to incubate innovations at the front of information technologies,\u201d said Zhao. He cited the metaverse collaboration between major Chinese liquor company Kweichow Moutai and tech giant NetEase that launched a winery-themed metaverse and issued NFTs linked to liquor bottles.China is adopting metaverse in real-world scenarios to improve legacy industries, services and government administration. Image: Getty ImagesChina\u2019s restrictions on cryptocurrencies and NFTs are another factor driving the focus on the industrial metaverse, according to Deng.\u201cOpen metaverses like Sandbox usually include cryptocurrencies as an incentivization. For example, Sandbox issues SAND, which users acquire to purchase NFTs. Then there will be trading, investments, speculations and potential money laundering in this ecosystem, but metaverse platforms might not meet the standards of financial regulators,\u201d he said.Deng noted that cryptocurrencies and NFTs are vital to verify ownership and facilitate transactions in open metaverses, which might be a future trend in metaverse technologies. However, the compliance issue outweighs the opportunity.\u201cThis (involvement of cryptocurrencies and NFTs) raises legal risks, and can be a policy-sensitive topic in China,\u201d said Deng.No cryptoThe financialization of digital assets is a hot-button issue for China\u2019s regulators, who outlawed initial coin offerings (ICO) of cryptocurrencies as early as 2017 and then issued a blanket ban on cryptocurrency trading in September 2021.As a result, policy makers have shunned public blockchains like Ethereum and Solana for private or permissioned networks without cryptocurrencies, where access is controlled by a single or several identified entities.\u201cChina\u2019s government favors a blockchain ecosystem without cryptocurrencies, making public blockchains hard to promote,\u201d said Deng. \u201cMeanwhile, private or permissioned blockchains are controlled by one big company or several centralized nodes, which are easier to supervise for regulators.\u201dHowever, China\u2019s crypto regulations might be open for revisions in the future, especially since Hong Kong introduced new rules for trading cryptocurrencies on June 1.\u201dIt\u2019s like what we did with Shenzhen in the Chinese Economic Reform in the 1980s,\u201d said Deng. \u201cWe can evaluate the risks in crypto assets through the experiments in Hong Kong, and then decide whether or how to adjust the crypto regulation in the mainland, which I think should definitely be open for consideration.\u201dHong Kong could be a sandbox for China to test Web 3.0 regulation. Image: Getty ImagesAnd public blockchains are still within the scope of China\u2019s policy makers. On June 13, the government of Shanghai released a three-year plan for technical research in the blockchain industry, which includes support for developer tools for both consortium blockchains and \u201cmainstream public blockchains,\u201d and to improve the interoperability between differently structured blockchain networks.Metaverse hypeWhile China aims to set a national metaverse strategy, that hasn\u2019t stopped the hype around the potential of the technology across the country and the FOMO (fear of missing out), with more than a dozen Chinese provinces and cities rolling out metaverse plans and policies.Regardless of different economic conditions, regional governments seem to boast the same ambitions: \u201cIntroducing at least 100 metaverse companies\u201d or \u201cbuilding at least 30 exemplary metaverse use cases.\u201dThese statements repeat in metaverse plans, whether they are the country\u2019s massive metropolises, such as Beijing and Shanghai, or less prominent ones like Jinan and Zhengzhou.Rivalry among Chinese government officials plays a role in the metaverse hype, said Deng, as careers rely on a jurisdiction\u2019s economic performance. The more revenue generated by local enterprises, the more likely local policy makers will receive a promotion.Shanghai plans to have a US$1.4 billion metaverse industrial fund by the end of 2025. Image: Envato ElementsSome cities are dangling cash. Zhengzhou City, which issued its metaverse plan relatively late on May 24, offers a startup capital investment of up to 200 million yuan (US$28.34 million) to metaverse companies that move their headquarters to the city.\u201cIt might be bad for the industry if so many regional governments rush out metaverse policies,\u201d said Deng.\u201cIt would be better to develop technologies first in tier-one cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhou and Hangzhou, and then use these cities as examples to expand the metaverse adoption in other regions,\u201d he said.ChallengesDespite the governments\u2019 ambition, some of China\u2019s biggest technology companies are seemingly winding down their metaverse businesses.In February 2023, Tencent, which runs China\u2019s top social media Wechat, ran what it called a \u201cpersonal reshuffle\u201d in its 300-person extended reality unit that handles metaverse initiatives, which local media said was a disbanding of the division.These developments took place as U.S. corporations such as Meta cut jobs and reported billions of dollars in losses at its metaverse operations. Disney also scrapped its metaverse plans.Baidu, the Chinese technology giant known as the country\u2019s equivalent of Google, also appears to be losing its interest in the metaverse.In May, Majie, the project manager of Baidu\u2019s Xi-rang metaverse, reportedly left the company, citing poor profitability and the company switching its focus to artificial intelligence. Baidu has not replied to Forkast.News request for comment.\u201cBuilding an immersive metaverse has great demands for hardware, software and research talents,\u201d Deng said.\u201cThe metaverse experience built by the above corporations (Tencent and Baidu) are still far from users\u2019 expectations. And Apple\u2019s recent virtual reality headset release indicates that the U.S. companies are still leading the global metaverse developments.\u201dChina\u2019s metaverse ambition face challenges from the U.S., South Korea and Japan. Image: Envato ElementsChina\u2019s metaverse developments face other challenges.\u201cMetaverse relies on high-performance computer CPUs, which are primarily produced by U.S. corporations such as Nvidia,\u201d said Deng.With the U.S. controlling the global chip supply and the persistent tension between the U.S. and China, \u201cit might be challenging to acquire enough qualified CPUs to satisfy the computing power demands from the metaverse industry.\u201dElsewhere, Japan and South Korea are also investing heavily in metaverses and their friendlier business environments and regulations might give them an edge, while China enjoys the advantage of user base and funding, said Deng.\u201cIn terms of promoting metaverse adoption with the might of capital, China is definitely the most likely to succeed.\u201dAccording to Zhao from Fudan University, the three countries\u2019 metaverse initiatives represent different aspects of the metaverse, which could all contribute to the future of this emerging industry.\u201cSouth Korea\u2019s metaverse roadmap is closer to the \u2018virtual space\u2019 route advocated by the likes of [Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s] Meta, while Japan focuses on Web 3.0 and digital assets,\u201d said Zhao from Fudan University.\u201cThe routes taken by the three countries have their own features, and I wish to see the three routes merge in 20 years when we finalize the definition of the metaverse.\u201d",

            "description": "Although belated, an unstoppable green investment push and an evolving regulatory framework are prompting companies in China to catch up and take action. Luna Jin reportsIF YOU ARE STILL BIDING your time with environmental and social governance (ESG) strategies, or executing them as mere formalities in China, think twice.In about 10 short years, the mentality of many pioneering businesses around the world has experienced a dramatic change from \u201cmake my business bigger first, then I\u2019ll take care of these issues\u201d to \u201cwhat I can do to help in my day-to-day business\u201d.Unlike developed markets, ESG practice in China has largely been driven by top-down policies. The country has been continually formulating and implementing policies towards international standards since 2012. For business entities, this means sustainability reporting will likely soon shift from voluntary to mandatory.Although these changes may seem late compared to the EU, US and other jurisdictions, once set in motion they will transform business decision-making and challenge the well-known Milton Friedman doctrine that a company\u2019s sole responsibility is to make money for its shareholders. Instead, the focus will shift to a broader consideration of \u201cstakeholders\u201d.Fuelling the irreversible trend, ESG investment is on the rise as capitalism reinvents itself and the world gradually wakes up from the fairy tales of eternal economic growth.Positioned at the intersection of legal, compliance and risk management, the general counsel is well aware that the added legal function is not just another hat that falls onto the legal department.With surging legal demand helping companies navigate ESG transitions, leading law firms in China are seeing great potential and building dedicated ESG service teams.At the forefront of China\u2019s experimentation of financial reform, Hong Kong has recently lined up its ESG regulatory requirements upgrade. As part of its efforts to maintain its status as a sustainable and environmentally friendly financial hub, the HKEX is preparing to enforce mandatory climate-related disclosures by all listed companies.The bourse initiated a three-month consultation in April 2023 regarding the proposed plan \u2013 the Enhancement of Climate-related Disclosure under the Environmental, Social and Governance Framework \u2013 which is expected to be more rigorous and comprehensive than the HKEX\u2019s current \u201ccomply or explain\u201d regime, which requires companies to either disclose or justify their lack of disclosure.GREEN FINANCIAL PUSHTo honour the political commitment of \u201cpeaking carbon emissions by 2030\u201d and \u201cachieving carbon neutral by 2060\u201d, the central government has imposed a series of green finance policies.As early as 2012, the former China Banking Regulatory Commission issued Green Credit Guidelines, which mandated banking and financial institutions to take the initiative to promote green credit and increase their support for the growth of green, low-carbon and circular economies.In 2018, the People\u2019s Bank of China, along with the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the National Development and Reform Commission, and the Ministry of Finance, jointly issued a series of documents, including the Opinions on Further Deepening Financial Services for Small and Micro Enterprises. This directive urged financial institutions to increase their investments in key economic and social areas, as well as address weak links such as small and micro enterprises.Four years later, the CBIRC introduced the Green Finance Guidelines for the Banking and Insurance Industry, requiring bancassurance institutions to promote green finance at a strategic level. For the first time, the guidelines proposed the incorporation of ESG requirements into the management processes and comprehensive risk management systems of these institutions.This has been followed by various industry associations issuing self-regulatory rules in succession, and stock exchanges and the National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors clarifying the definition and issuance requirements of green bonds.The Asset Management Association of China (AMAC) published the Green Investment Guidelines (For Trial Implementation) in 2018. These guidelines defined the meaning of green investment, encouraged the fund industry to develop green investments, and provided guidance to fund managers on using published green criteria to screen investment targets for green investments.A year later, the China Trustee Association announced the Green Trust Guidelines, which encourage trust companies to develop green trusts and require them to follow publicly available green criteria when selecting investment targets for such trusts.\u201cBy imposing green finance business requirements on financial institutions, it will reverse the process of promoting and monitoring ESG cultural construction and fulfilment of ESG commitments by enterprises with financing needs,\u201d says Damon Quan, a Shanghai-based partner at Han Kun Law Offices.Impacted by both international practices and the nationwide domestic rallying cry of green finance, the number of ESG funds in China doubled in 2021, according to public data.",

            "description": "Welcome to Local Heroes, our column dedicated to emerging local and national brands across all categories and geographies.Today\u2019s spotlight falls on bubble milk tea producer BlackBall Taiwanese Dessert, which is gearing up for concerted expansion in travel retail following a debut at Vancouver International Airport and a highly successful showing at May\u2019s TFWA Asia Pacific Exhibition in Singapore for its newly created and pioneering brand BAL.BAL. Remember the name. The Taiwanese brand is ready to burst onto the travel scene. Literally.The Blackball-owned brand produces a variety of bursting boba and fruit and tea dry toppings, including a series of uniquely Taiwanese products. These are made using molecular gastronomy techniques to present a wide range of fruit and food flavors in innovative ways.This year BAL broke new ground globally by becoming the first brand to inject classic spirits (including vodka, rum, tequila, gin and whisky); cocktails \u2013 from Martinis to Daiquiris, Margaritas to Mojitos \u2013 and can even mix Champagne with different flavour bursting bobas.The technique allows the nectar to burst with flavours into the consumer\u2019s mouth, bolstered by a vibrant array of colours. The company believes the concept has huge potential in travel retail, tapping into younger adult drinkers\u2019 tastes and trends.BlackBall is a leader in high-quality desserts and bubble milk tea in Taiwan. It has evolved from a street-side store 20 years ago to a modern central factory that supplies high-quality products to more than 13,000 supermarkets and retail stores throughout Taiwan.That local success has created the platform for rapid international expansion, including travel retail. Today the company has more than 100 stores worldwide in countries including Canada, Australia, Malaysia and Singapore, with a mission \u201cto spread the delicious taste of Taiwan around the world\u201d.\u201cOur product application scenarios are very comprehensive,\u201d the company says. \u201cThey can be put into beverages, juices, yoghurt, beer, Champagne or spirits. The combination turns into an extremely wonderful drink in terms of taste, colour and fun. We also have alcohol-free Popping Boba with different fruit flavours to offer customers more choice.\u201dLeveraging that promising entry, BlackBall and BAL have begun intensive travel retail marketing, starting with Canada and the US, followed by rapid development in Asia Pacific including Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Japan and South Korea. Expansion to Europe including Italy and France will come next.Speaking to The Moodie Davitt Report during the Singapore show, BlackBall Taiwan Dessert Operations & Rebranding Director Watson Chen said: \u201cEveryone in Taiwan knows bubble tea, it\u2019s really famous.\u201cToday, cocktails such as Aperol Spritz are very popular around the world, particularly in countries such as Italy and France. So, many alcohol brands want to make the base for a cocktail.\u201cWe can help the brands create a new solution. We can put the alcohol inside our bubble,\u201d he added, noting that non-alcohol spirits options will also be available.Just as chocolate companies such as Anton Berg work with spirits brands for liqueur- and spirits-infused chocolates, BlackBall plans to partner leading drinks companies to create a range of new alcohol (and low & non-alcohol) option. Besides travel retail, distribution channels will include supermarkets and restaurants.Multipacks featuring different fruit flavours and spirits bases will be made available in duty free at a range of accessible price points. BAL can also tailor specific travel retailer-exclusives, Chen added.\u201cEverything is from Taiwan,\u201d he commented. \u201cSo we want to promote the culture and provide fancy and attractive solutions, not just sell the product.\u201dCommenting on the initiative, The Moodie Davitt Report Chief China Representative Zhang Yimei (former Deputy General Manager at Hainan Tourism Investment Duty Free Co in Sanya) said: \u201cThe concept is very strong because, firstly, BlackBall wants to showcase the Taiwan culture outside the island.\u201cSecondly, while young people still like to drink nowadays, they don\u2019t want to drink too much. So that\u2019s why they love the cocktail kind of drink and also food together with the liquor, which bubble tea offers.\u201cBubble tea was already very famous and is becoming very popular in many more markets. So BlackBall and BAL have made this combination with spirits, which shows a lot of creativity. The concept and even the machine that makes the products were innovated by the owner and by the team.\u201cSo it\u2019s something fresh and new to the market and also a very good solution for the liquor business in reaching new consumers, for example women and those who only drink lightly.\u201cThe product has a very nice image \u2013 and looks really good in photos. So it\u2019s something different and fashionable to attract women and the younger generation just as, say, Jack Daniel\u2019s has done with Coca-Cola and Kweichow Moutai with ice cream.\u201d Look out for more on BAL in coming months via The Moodie Davitt Report. \u2708ContactEmail: watson.chen@bobabal.comWeChat: Watson_Chen1228",

            "description": "\u201cCross-border M&A was the fastest way for Asia-Pacific consumer products companies to build business overseas,\u201d analysts led by Gino Dizon said in the report on Monday.Tracing mergers and acquisitions (M&As) between 2012 and 2021, the consultancy firm said such companies increased their overseas revenue contribution by 27 per cent on average, eight percentage points higher than those without acquisitions.Asia-Pacific consumer products companies that expanded overseas such as China\u2019s Haier and Japan\u2019s Asahi saw revenue growth of up to 1,250 per cent, way higher than those with a domestic focus, according to Bain & Co.Chinese home appliances giant Haier, which closed three deals, was the most successful. It increased overseas revenue by 1,247 per cent to US$18 billion over the course of 10 years.Japanese food and drinks giant Asahi made eight overseas acquisitions between 2012 to 2021. Photo: ReutersIt was followed by Asahi and CJ CheilJedang. The Japanese food and drinks giant closed eight deals and earned 551 per cent more revenue offshore, while the South Korean food manufacturer grew revenue by 337 per cent with four deals.Chinese companies with a domestic focus such as Gree, Kweichow Moutai and Wuliangye Yibin, which did not make any cross-border deals, saw their overseas revenue increase by less than 10 percentage points.Tapping foreign markets was a major driver for companies\u2019 growth, the report found. Between 2012 and 2021, the top 50 consumer products companies in the Asia-Pacific region saw overseas revenue grow 9 per cent on average, compared with domestic revenue of only 3 per cent. Overseas revenue contributed 29 per cent to their total revenue in 2021, up from 20 per cent in 2012.Chinese companies had the fastest offshore growth at 17 per cent during the period, while growth at home stood at 7 per cent. In 2021, 22 mainland companies included in the study saw overseas revenue rise 49 per cent to US$58 trillion from four years ago, accounting for a fifth of their total sales.Offshore growth also helped Japanese companies keep their losses in check. Their overseas revenue grew 6 per cent to offset the 4 per cent decline at home.Chinese companies with a domestic focus such as Kweichow Moutai, which did not make any cross-border deals, saw overseas revenue increase by less than 10 percentage points. Photo: Zigor AldamaBut Bain said expanding overseas business could be challenging for some. \u201cBrands developed for local audiences sometimes fail to resonate with overseas consumers,\u201d the consultancy said. Navigating new regulatory and business environments was also seen as a deterrent.Cross-border acquisitions take a significant amount of time, but it allows companies to get a jump start and allows for effective acquisition of local talent and capabilities, said Bain\u2019s Shanghai-based partner Philip Leung.That is not to say M&A is a simple, quick answer to overseas success. Bain said acquirers need to focus on the intent of the deal, design a value creation plan and navigate fault lines like culture and governance.\u201cWe analysed 3,000 global large companies\u2019 deal activities over 10 years and what we found is that the group that does M&A frequently and at scale achieves the most superior total shareholder return (TSR), 11 per cent versus 7.9 per cent on average,\u201d Leung said.\u201cInterestingly, the group that did a few large deals without enough deal experience achieved the lowest TSR of 5.1 per cent, lower than the group that has been inactive in M&A,\u201d he said.\u201cThis shows that experience and a repeatable M&A model are essential to realising value from a scale and complex deal.\u201d",

            "description": "(Yicai Global) May 19 -- Kweichow Moutai, a leading Chinese liquor distiller, plans to set up two investment funds with CNY10 billion (USD1.4 billion) to increase its financial returns.Kweichow Moutai has partnered with China Merchants Capital and Goldstone Investment, the private equity arms of China Merchants Group and Citic Securities, to establish the funds, the Zunyi-based company said yesterday. Each fund will have CNY5.5 billion (USD782.7 million), with Kweichow Moutai providing 91 percent of the funding.The two will mainly help Kweichow Moutai's return on funds, a person connected with the firm told Yicai Global today. It aims to invest in biotechnology, next-generation information technology, new energy, new materials, high-end equipment, and the mass consumption fields, he noted, adding that the specific investment areas will only be decided once the funds are set up.Kweichow Moutai's performance benchmark for the funds is 6 percent a year, it said, adding that its capital contributions will be made in three phases, with the first set at 40 percent and the other two at 30 percent each.The firm has ample cash flow thanks to stable profits.

            "description": "Luxury has always been a rarefied world that few can access.And as it was in the store, so it was on Wall Street, where the Average Joe or Jolene investors could not easily bet on the big European stalwarts like LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton or Herm\u00e8s International, which trade in Paris.But Tema Global is changing that with a new exchange traded fund \u2014 the Tema Luxury ETF \u2014 that makes it easier to invest in the spending power of the ultra wealthy.While the fund is a democratizing force in luxury investing, the team behind it takes more of a purist view of the sector, focusing on the truly premium players and bypassing the more affordable brands, like Tesla or Nike, that sometimes get lumped into the sector by financial types.The ETF launched this month under the \u201cLUX\u201d ticker and lets traders take a stake in a group of stocks at once, including LVMH and Herm\u00e8s, but also Ferrari, spirit makers Pernod Ricard and Kweichow Moutai Co., beauty giant L\u2019Or\u00e9al and more.Some of those companies make products mere mortals can buy, but the idea hew closer to the spending of the \u201cif-you-have-to-ask, it\u2019s-too-expensive\u201d crowd.It\u2019s a consumer cohort that is relatively small in numbers, but big in spending and has been growing stronger and more resistant to the kind of shocks that caused the industry to slow down in the past.A stock market crash in the U.S. might not be enough anymore to make the luxury shopper wince.\u201cWhat makes luxury so resilient today is geographic diversification, but also demographic diversification,\u201d said Maurits Pot, chief executive officer and founder of Tema. \u201cFirst-time customers are younger, they can participate easier, they can participate quicker and ultimately the category is becoming more accessible financially.\u201cIf you think about luxury ultimately as the aspirational ladder of consumerism, then people can enter the ladder at different points and there\u2019s more entry points for the luxury consumer at both the low end but also at the higher end,\u201d he said.A more global customer base also provides some cushion for the companies.Javier Lastra, fund manager of Lux, said: \u201cThe common message from all the companies is that the U.S. is slowing\u2026and a lot of that is being compensated by Chinese reopening.\u201d\u201cIf you think about how wealth portfolios of wealthy Chinese people are structured, it\u2019s very different to how American portfolios are structured,\u201d Lastra said. \u201cIn China, a lot of it has to do with real estate.\u201dThat makes for less volatility overall in the profile of luxury shoppers, who have ridden what Lastra described as a \u201ctremendous secular trend.\u201d\u201cGenerally global wealth keeps rising and we see it in all the segments of the consumer goods industry,\u201d he said.Parts of the customer base might be new, but the brands are generally old in luxury \u2014 and therefore protected, making the companies all the more attractive to investors.Lastra said a key difference between technology and luxury is \u201cthe longevity of the trend.\u201d\u201cWhen I think about an Apple watch or I think about an iPhone, at the end of the day, it is like a machine, a toasting machine, right? It\u2019s great innovation in year one, but clearly it will be disrupted in year two, year three,\u201d he said. \u201cThis disruption in luxury goods is hard, it hardly exists. We had the issue of the Apple Watch disrupting potentially the high-end watches. It really didn\u2019t disrupt that. The reason why you\u2019re buying a Cartier watch is very different.\u201dThat is the magic of luxury. And, at least lately, that magic has been good for investors.",

            "description": "NewsBy Jessica MasonBelgian monks have responded to Trappist beers being illegally resold at high prices by making changes to how their beers are obtained.After discovering their beers were being legally resold at inflated prices in other countries, the brothers of Belgium\u2019s Saint-Sixtus Abbey have made moves to remind people that Trappist beer is not brewed for the benefit of profiteers.Until now, the sale of Trappist beer from Saint-Sixtus Abbey has been strictly regulated and has previously only truly been available to private individuals able to collect their orders at the abbey door or a nearby visitor centre. Back in 2021, the abbey initially trialled a pilot home delivery project, taking orders of a maximum of one crate of beer to customers with an address in Belgium, but it was not enough to quell demand and profiteering rackets have pushed the abbey to adapt its rules for a trial period of a year to try to stamp out illegal sales.To tackle the issue, this week, the abbey revealed plans for its three beers \u2014 Trappist Westvleteren Blond, Trappist Westvleteren VIII, and Trappist Westvleteren XII \u2014 to be sold in independent Dutch liquor stores for a year in a bid to stop businesses buying crates from the abbey and reselling them over the border at inflated prices. During the year-long trial period, the abbey\u2019s Trappist beer will also be distributed in the Netherlands via an importer in Hulst.According to reports via Dutch newspaper the Algemeen Dagblad, the abbey had managed to tackle illegal reselling in Belgium, but the brothers were still consternated that the problem had shifted over the border.The Dutch Catholic newspaper Katholiek Nieuwsblad highlighted the issue further and pointed out that \u201ca lucrative profiteering business in the Netherlands, with bottles of Trappist being resold to stores, cafes, and restaurants for large sums of money\u201d due to the product\u2019s popularity and scarcity.Currently, a crate of 24 bottles of Trappist Westvleteren XII ordered from the abbey website retails for \u20ac48.80, equal to a little more than \u20ac2 per bottle. But the same beer, when bought through an unauthorised retailer in another country, the same much-coveted beer has been reported to cost more than \u20ac10 per bottle.Responding to the issue, the abbey told reporters: \u201cThese usurious practises are diametrically opposed to the values of the community. After all, the brothers want as many people as possible to enjoy their Trappist beers at a normal, fair price.\u201dThe brewery at Saint-Sixtus Abbey, situated in the Belgian province of West Flanders, dates back to 1839 when it received a brewer\u2019s license signed by Belgium\u2019s King Leopold I.The abbey brewery belongs to the Order of Cistercians of the Strict Observance and has 20 monks and nine lay workers who work just 42 brewing days per year and annually to produce approximately 7,500 hectolitres of its highly-sought-after unfiltered and unpasteurised Trappist beer.The beers must be strictly made by monks using the infusion brew method using only the natural ingredients of water, barley malt, hops, and yeast. Additonally, to qualify for the Trappist mark, all beers must be created within the abbey environs with the process supervised by monks or nuns, and any profits going back to the religious community or charitable works.Only five of Belgium\u2019s beers bear the \u2018Authentic Trappist Product\u2019 logo: Chimay, Orval, Rochefort, Westmalle, and Westvleteren with the Trappist Westvleteren XII beers often considered to be the rarest.Recent reports have shown how the future of Trappist beer faces increasing uncertainty due to fewer people are being drawn to life as a monk. Just this month, another Trappist brewery revealed it was set to close after news that its last four monks had stated their intentions to depart, leaving the Trappist beer category in a precarious position.",

            "description": "Darius McDermott, Chelsea Financial Services & FundCalibreSmall and mid-cap funds tend to fare poorly during a bear market, which should in theory mean that they are set to struggle for the foreseeable future, especially as the US Federal Reserve is still forecasting a mild recession towards the back end of 2023.The Russell 2000 small-caps index is lagging behind the S&P 500 this year, edging up about 0.3% compared with a gain of 7% for the large-cap index as a number of small-cap ETFs have bled billions of dollars, particularly following the bank collapses in March.However, there are many that think that there are reasons to be cheerful this time around. For one thing, valuations are a lot more attractive for small and mid-cap funds than they have been for a long time.This is particularly true in Europe, where over the past decade a lot of money has gone into large companies like L\u2019Oreal and LVMH, leaving behind a long tail of small and mid-cap companies that look undervalued and under-researched.In addition, for those that seek exposure to some of the secular growth themes such as digitalisation and renewable energy, the leaders in those fields are often small and mid-cap companies.Some market observers are drawing parallels between now and the period immediately following the dotcom bubble bursting in 2000. In the seven-year period following the market peak in March 2000, small caps were up by more than 70%, whereas large caps were up by less than 10%.Against this backdrop, Darius McDermott, managing director at Chelsea Financial Services and FundCalibre, selected two small/mid-cap funds for comparison for this week\u2019s head-to-head. He chose the Stewart Investors Asia Pacific Sustainability fund and the Ninety One Asia Pacific Franchise fund.Ninety One Stewart Investors Size $54.1m $825.3m Inception 2018 2005 Managers Charlie Dutton David Gait, Sashi Reddy Three-year cumulative return 1.92% 12.07% Three-year annualised return -4.71% 5.89% Three-year annualised alpha -4.70 7.55 Three-year annualised volatility 19.2% 14.81% Three-year information ratio -0.56 0.67 Morningstar star rating ** ***** Morningstar analyst rating Bronze Silver FE Crown fund rating 2.02% ***** OCF (retail share class) 1.06% 0.93% Source: FE Fundinfo, Morningstar. (Data in US dollars, 16 May 2023)Investment approach\u201cThe Stewart Investors team completely ignore benchmarks and peer groups when selecting investments for their portfolio \u2013 while the sustainability name indicates the managers only invest in businesses where all stakeholders (shareholders, employees and customers) are well treated,\u201d said McDermott.With the team prioritising corporate governance, McDermott observes that the fund\u2019s managers will only invest in companies where the interests of minority shareholders are respected. These requirements immediately rule out a large part of the index and many state-owned enterprises \u2013 immediately creating dispersion in returns when compared to their peers.The fund managers\u2019 process is bottom-up and largely ignores changes in the macroeconomic environment. Investment ideas are generated from company visits, research trips and industry contacts. They largely ignore sell-side analysts and prefer to do their own research. Valuation and price are considered at the initial point of investment. While managers are happy to pay a fair price for a business, they tend to avoid paying extremely high prices, in line with their views on capital preservation. They also avoid investing in speculative companies.Risk is managed primarily at the stock level through investing in soundly managed, financially strong and sensibly priced companies. The portfolio is concentrated, with around 60 holdings. This is an all-cap fund so the managers are not constrained by the size of the companies they choose to include in their portfolio. From a sector perspective, the fund has typically had its largest exposures in consumer products and IT. Fund performance has been consistently excellent for a very long time; it has also been less volatile than the rest of its peer group.\u201cThe Stewart Investors team completely ignore benchmarks and peer groups when selecting investments for their portfolio \u2013 while the sustainability name indicates the managers only invest in businesses where all stakeholders (shareholders, employees and customers) are well treated.\u201d Darius McDermott, Chelsea Financial Services & FundCalibreOn the other hand, the Ninety One fund, which typically holds around 30 companies, is very high conviction in nature. The fund\u2019s emphasis is on finding exceptional businesses through detailed fundamental research. It typically ignores more cyclical and lower quality parts of the market such as energy, materials and utilities. The philosophy is that the market underappreciates the ability of high-quality companies to earn excess returns for long periods of time. These rare businesses are able to deliver consistent growth in intrinsic value.Small companies with a market capitalisation of less than $2bn are removed, as are lower quality sectors and industries. This reduces the universe to just 300 stocks. From this list, ideas are generated from screens, internal research and external sources. The team actively covers around 100 stocks with in-depth fundamental research. From this list between 25 and 40 stocks make it into the final portfolio.To be considered a franchise and have the chance of making it into the portfolio, a company must have the following characteristics: hard-to-replicate enduring competitive advantage; dominant market position in a stable growing industry; low sensitivity to the economic cycle; healthy balance sheets and low capital intensity; and sustainable cash generation and effective capital allocation.The portfolio is predominately large cap, although it is both benchmark agnostic and unconstrained. The quality growth nature of the fund is reflected in a consistently high exposure to telecommunications, media and technology stocks.The fund promotes environmental and social characteristics in line with Article 8 of the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation. Additionally, the fund will not invest in certain sectors or investments.Fund characteristicsSector allocation:NinetyOne Stewart Investors Information Technology 28.1% Information Technology 18.8% Consumer Staples 16.0% Consumer Staples 18.3% Communication Services 15.3% Health Care 17.8% Health Care 14.2% Industrials 15.5% Consumer Discretionary 13.7% Consumer Discretionary 13.1% Financials 9.3% Financials 10.0% Materials 2.8% Communication Services 1.2% Cash 0.6% Cash and Cash Equivalents 5.1% Source: Fund factsheets, 31 Mar 2023Top 5 holdings:NinetyOne Weighting Stewart Investors Weighting Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing 9.8% Tube Investments of India 5.7% Tencent 8.8% Mahindra & Mahindra 5.3% Alibaba Group 7.6% Unicharm Corporation 4.5% Samsung Electronics 7.4% CSL 4.1% Kweichow Moutai 6.2% Voltronic Power Technology 3.1% Source: Fund factsheets, 31 March 2023Geographical Allocation:NinetyOne Weighting Stewart Investors Weighting China 41.6% India 41.1% Australia 12.5% Taiwan 11.6% Taiwan 9.8% China 10.7% United States 9.6% Japan 8.8% South Korea 7.4% Australia 6.0% Source: Fund factsheets, 31 March 2023PerformanceBoth Stewart Investors and Ninety One are high conviction funds but operate in very different ways. Some similarities lie in the screening out of speculative, smaller businesses.According to FE fundinfo data, the Ninety One fund generated 1.92% in terms of three-year cumulative return, while the Stewart Investors fund posted a return of 12.07% for the same period.Three year returns in USDThe Stewart Investors team is an expert in Asia and very risk averse (despite having a reasonably high conviction portfolio in terms of the number of stocks), so while the fund may not capture all the upside in a strongly rising market, it will protect on the downside. This is reflected by the fund being less volatile than its peers, notes McDermott.Meanwhile, he points out that the Ninety One fund is arguably higher conviction in nature. Performance is also indicative of this quality growth focus, with the fund outperforming in these periods and underperforming when value is the more dominant investment style, adds McDermott.Discrete calendar year performanceFund/Sector YTD* 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 NinetyOne 3.61 % -21.33% -9.39% 29.92% 28.83% \u2013 Stewart Investors 2.59% -15.06% 14.13% 26.11% 9.36% 0.87% Asia Pacific ex Japan 1.26% -19.04% 0.11% 21.83% 18.21% -16.05% Source: FE Fundinfo. Annual returns in US dollars. *1 Jan 2023 \u2013 16 May 2023Manager review\u201cWe would have no concerns about either team. The Stewart Investors team are market leaders in Asia, with a huge team of analysts and fund managers \u2013 all of whom have demonstrated the success of their process over a number of decades,\u201d said McDermott.David Gait has been part of the Stewart Investors team since 1997. He has helped manage the similar Stewart Investors Asia Pacific Leaders Sustainability fund since its inception in 2015. Sashi Reddy joined Stewart Investors in 2007. He is also co-manager of the Asia Pacific Leaders Sustainability fund and the Indian Subcontinent Sustainability fund. Both have run this fund since 2019.The Ninety One fund sits in the quality growth team, which runs a few funds at the asset manager. It is also backed by a strong team of both fund managers and research analysts.Charlie Dutton, who runs the fund, has more than 20 years Asian equity investment experience. He began his career as an analyst with HSBC in 1997 and was subsequently head of research for Asian equities at JP Morgan. Prior to joining Ninety One, Dutton was a portfolio manager at Coupland Cardiff.Conclusion\u201cI\u2019d actually argue both can do a job in an investor\u2019s portfolio. If you are looking for a safe pair of hands, then the Stewart Investors fund is ideal. It is quite risk averse, but the team has so much experience that it can -and will \u2013 take advantage of opportunities on the upside. The team has huge amounts of experience in navigating many different environments and has shown the investment process does stand up in any of them. This is an ideal \u2018set and forget\u2019 holding for core Asian equities exposure,\u201d McDermott said.Despite facing headwinds in the past couple of years, the Ninety One fund also has merit for investors, particularly if growth-style investing comes back into fashion. It is important to remember this is a quality growth fund, which dovetails nicely with the emergence of quality in Asia Pacific, in particular the healthcare, IT and consumer sectors. These are long-term trends this fund plays into so you just have to prepare for the ups and downs, cautions McDermott.",

They entered on business visas processed with the help of the Chinese embassy in Singapore. While they paid for their air tickets, all other expenses were borne by the Sichuan government.To explore opportunities for collaboration, the group visited places such as the city of Mianyang, the districts of Wenjiang and Qingyang, and a development area called the Tianfu New Area. In Chengdu, they met officials from the Singapore consulate.There were also discussions with Chinese officials, the highest-ranked of whom was Sichuan Provincial Standing Committee member Zhao Junming. Mr Zhao is also head of the Sichuan arm of the United Front Work Department, which maintains ties with the ethnic Chinese diaspora, especially individuals who play significant roles in their own communities.Mr Du is among a small group of Singaporeans who were among the first to be invited to visit China again after it emerged from nearly three years of travel restrictions. As China doubles down on economic recovery this year, it is on a drive to welcome back foreign businessmen and investors with longstanding ties.Mr Du and others who spoke to The Straits Times described a China that is striving to move forward from one of the world\u2019s longest Covid-19 lockdowns.Former People\u2019s Action Party MP Seng Han Thong visited Yunnan and Guizhou provinces from Feb 25 to March 3 with 20 others.The group made stops at locations such as Maotai town, where the fiery Kweichow Moutai liquor is produced, as well as Zunyi, a historically significant location in Communist Party history.The visit made local news and was hailed by Guizhou state media as the \u201cfirst tourist group from Singapore\u201d to visit the region since the pandemic.Mr Seng said of his visit: \u201cThere were much fewer people, but many shops were open and the desire to recover from the pandemic was there, although my impressions were superficial as I only visited briefly.\u201dThe former politician said that the group travelled on business visas, which were approved with the help of the Chinese embassy. He was invited to join the trip as a regular customer of the organiser, China Express Travel, a Singapore-based agency specialising in tours to the north-western parts of China. Its founder Li Liang Yi was also part of the group.When Mr Seng returned to Singapore, he participated in a Guizhou-Singapore Trade and Investment Cooperation Symposium, which he posted about on his social media account.",

            "description": "(Bloomberg) \u2013 \u00c9 prov\u00e1vel que as a\u00e7\u00f5es chinesas voltem a subir com a recupera\u00e7\u00e3o esperada dos lucros das empresas neste trimestre, de acordo com o co-gestor de um fundo de a\u00e7\u00f5es de mercados emergentes da Vontobel Holding AG.\u201cOs ganhos foram abalados, ent\u00e3o a recupera\u00e7\u00e3o deve ser relativamente ampla\u201d, disse Thomas Schaffner, que ajuda a administrar o fundo Vontobel Fund-mtx Sustainable Emerging Markets Leaders, de US$ 4 bilh\u00f5es. O crescimento dos lucros da China pode chegar a cerca de 20% este ano conforme a economia se recupere, um ritmo que ultrapassaria o de v\u00e1rios pa\u00edses, acrescentou.Uma recupera\u00e7\u00e3o amplamente esperada do rali de reabertura da China n\u00e3o ocorreu em meio \u00e0s tens\u00f5es do pa\u00eds com os Estados Unidos e \u00e0 perspectiva de crescimento incerta. Uma contra\u00e7\u00e3o surpreendente no setor manufatureiro sugere que bols\u00f5es de fraqueza permanecem na economia, mesmo depois que o pa\u00eds abandonou suas r\u00edgidas restri\u00e7\u00f5es devido ao coronav\u00edrus.Os resultados do primeiro trimestre foram prejudicados por um janeiro fraco, conforme a China sa\u00eda de sua pol\u00edtica de Covid zero, e os \u201cdados econ\u00f4micos do segundo trimestre devem realmente come\u00e7ar a parecer melhores\u201d, com o crescimento dos lucros catalisando o mercado, acrescentou.Os \u00edndices de a\u00e7\u00f5es em Hong Kong e na China continental lutam para manter os ganhos de 2023, com fundos estrangeiros se tornando vendedores l\u00edquidos no fim de abril, enquanto os EUA avaliam as restri\u00e7\u00f5es de investimento. O \u00edndice MSCI China caiu cerca de 5% no m\u00eas passado, registrando seu pior abril desde 2004 e tornando-se um retardat\u00e1rio proeminente entre os principais indicadores do mundo.Ainda assim, alguns frutos come\u00e7aram a surgir da atual temporada de balan\u00e7os na China. Muitos executivos da ind\u00fastria, incluindo a fabricante de baterias Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. e a gigante de bebidas Kweichow Moutai Co., relataram resultados mais fortes do que o esperado.CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADESchaffner espera que os lucros se recuperem, j\u00e1 que as press\u00f5es sobre a margem l\u00edquida de juros provavelmente atingiram o pico no setor financeiro. Os bancos chineses lideraram uma recupera\u00e7\u00e3o no mercado nesta segunda-feira (8), quando tr\u00eas institui\u00e7\u00f5es nacionais reduziram as taxas de dep\u00f3sito.Schaffner tamb\u00e9m est\u00e1 explorando investimentos na cadeia dom\u00e9stica de ve\u00edculos el\u00e9tricos, incluindo montadoras, e disse que as recentes guerras de pre\u00e7os com a Tesla e outras fabricantes provavelmente s\u00e3o um fen\u00f4meno de curto prazo.O fundo \u2013 que teve retorno de 2,8% este ano, superando cerca de dois ter\u00e7os de seus pares \u2013 vem reduzindo lentamente seu peso geral na China continental desde o in\u00edcio de 2023, de acordo com seus documentos. No entanto, o peso destas a\u00e7\u00f5es ainda era de 43,8% no final de mar\u00e7o, bem acima da participa\u00e7\u00e3o da China no \u00edndice MSCI Emerging Markets, que era de 30%.O gestor espera que as a\u00e7\u00f5es asi\u00e1ticas superem os mercados desenvolvidos este ano, impulsionadas pelo crescimento dos lucros da China, uma baixa no ciclo de semicondutores e um d\u00f3lar mais fraco.Para os fabricantes de chips de mem\u00f3ria, os n\u00edveis de estoque atingiram o pico, a produ\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e1 sendo cortada ap\u00f3s perdas e \u201cprovavelmente a demanda aumentar\u00e1 no segundo semestre\u201d,\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE"

Connells Group, after its acquisition of Countrywide, and earlier acquisitions, is the largest estate agency group in the UK, with turnover of \u00a3999.5m.In March 2021, the acquisition of Countrywide by Connells was completed after three troubled years for the board. This move brings stability to Countrywide, freeing it from external debt and uncertainty. Connells continues operating Countrywide as a standalone business, but with new investments in technology and personnel to improve its service.Leaders Roman Group, owned by private equity firm Platinum Equity, is the second largest estate agency group in the UK, with a turnover of \u00a3165.0m. In January 2022, Bowmark Capital agreed to sell Leaders Romans Group (LRG), one of the largest property services groups in the UK, to Platinum Equity. LRG was formed in 2016 from the merger of two Bowmark portfolio companies, Leaders Lettings and Romans Group and it has carried out 132 bolt-on acquisitions of branches and lettings portfolios.LSL's estate agency division had a turnover in 2021 of \u00a3154.6m, up from \u00a3128.7m in 2020. The estate agency division's turnover was down in 2022, at \u00a3146.8m. In January 2023, LSL announced the disposal of its London estate agency business, Marsh & Parsons, to Dexters (4th in the list) for a consideration of \u00a329m.The Top Ten UK Estate Agents Groups by Turnover 2021 data comes from Company Insight's UK Estate Agents Company Insight data product, which includes turnover for 45+ largest estate agents; as well as a range of other metrics, including operating profit and margin, turnover per employee, turnover per office, operating profit per employee, number of employees, number of offices, growth, and turnover by segment as well as many more metrics (property sales turnover, lettings turnover, financial products turnover, conveyancing turnover and other turnover).More details on the product can be found on the product page and other press releases. More 'top ten' data rankings will be released over time. Data for 2022 will be available soon and the data will be updated to reflect the new figures.Paul C, Company Insight, Orion Drive, Brackley, UKCompany Insight focuses entirely on analysing the performance of UK companies (and UK performance of companies headquartered elsewhere) within niche and highly fragmented sectors which are often overlooked by other research companies.",

            "description": "A barman stirs a cocktail based on the Chinese spirit baijiu at the Capital Spirits Baijiu Bar in Beijing, China June 22, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas Peter/File Photo Acquire Licensing RightsSYDNEY, April 27 (Reuters) - Chinese spirit maker ZJLD Group's (6979.HK) shares ended down 18% on their first day of trading on Thursday, dampening hopes that a positive debut for the largest new share sale in Hong Kong in 2023 could spark a rush of listings in the second half.The KKR-backed company raised $675.2 million last week in the biggest new share sale in Hong Kong since CALB Group Co (3931.HK) raised $1.3 billion in October.Dealmakers had hoped a strong first day performance by ZJLD could give companies looking to list in Hong Kong confidence to press ahead with new deals and help revive the city's weak IPO market.ZJLD shares opened at HK$9 compared to the issue price of HK$10.82 each. The stock sank to a low of HK$8.82 in the afternoon before it ended at HK$8.88, still down 17.9% from the IPO price. That compared to a 0.4% gain in Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index (.HSI).The IPO price was at the lower end of the HK$10.78 to HK$12.98 per share range indicated to investors when the deal was launched.ZJLD produces baijiu, the clear distilled spirit popular across China. The drink is considered China's national liquor and is the world's most consumed liquor, according to ZJLD's prospectus.\"The tepid listing would probably fail to lift the ECM (equity capital markets) sentiment in Hong Kong and deals in the second half would probably need to come in at a more digestible valuation to garner a successful listing,\" said Clarence Chu, an Aequitas Research analyst who publishes on Smartkarma.ZJLD's three major baijiu rivals, led by Kweichow Moutai (600519.SS), have seen shares fall by between 7.6% and 22% since late January.\"The fall on debut is an adjustment of the relatively high pricing and is in line with the soft market,\" said Linus Yip, chief strategist at First Shanghai Securities referring to the softer premium baijiu sector and broader Hong Kong market.There was just $508.3 million worth of new share sales in Hong Kong in the first quarter, according to Refinitiv data, down from $1.2 billion in the same period last year.Institutional investors subscribed for 3.9 times the amount of ZJLD shares on offer in that tranche, according to the firm's filings, which was above many other Hong Kong IPOs this year.Reporting by Scott Murdoch; Editing by Jacqueline WongOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

ZJLD, a holding company for four of them \u2013 ZhenJiu (\u73cd\u9152), Li Du (\u674e\u6e21), Xiang Jiao (\u6e58\u7a96) and Kai and Kou Xiao (\u958b\u53e3\u7b11)- raised HK$5.3 billion in Hong Kong last week.The listing will be the first for a Chinese Baijiu producer in seven years and the first outside of China.With revenue of RMB 5.1 billion, ZJLD ranked fourth among privately-owned Baijiu companies by value in China and is also the third largest Baijiu producer in terms of revenue that offer three aroma types Baijiu products in China\u2019s Baijiu industry in 2021.Zhen Jiu, a sauce aroma Baijiu, is the flagship liquor brand for ZJLD (pic: Internet)Nicknamed as \u201cGodfather of Baijiu\u201d, Wu built an empire that touches on every aspect of the fiery spirit from production to distribution to brand creation to retailing.He rose to prominence in China\u2019s drinks industry after successfully launching Jin Liu Fu in 1990s, a popular Baijiu brand from his home base in Hunan, which gave him the capital and confidence to later acquire over 10 different spirits brands.Interestingly, Wu intially aspired to build his company into Pernod Ricard or Diageo of China, he revealed in one interview, but was daunted by the fact that it was impossible for his privately owned company to buy the country\u2019s flagship Baijiu brands such as Kweichow Moutai, thus giving him the drive to create brands of his own.Aside from Baijiu production, his empire built a successful distribution business mainly through VATS Liquor store which distributes known Baijiu brands from Kweichow Moutai to its own brands, as well as popular wines such as DBR Lafite and Penfolds.He also owns three wineries in Yunnan and Shandong, including Shangri-la wine group.Like this: Like Loading...",

            "description": "A woman plays an interactive dance game at the booth of China Mobile during the Light of Internet Expo in Wuzhen, East China's Zhejiang Province. File photo: XinhuaChina Mobile, a major mobile carrier, became the most valuable stock on the A-share market on Monday morning, beating top distiller Kweichow Moutai, as investors bet on the blossoming digital transformation in the world's second-largest economy.During the morning session, shares of China Mobile were up by more than 4 percent at one point, pushing its market capitalization to 2.19 trillion yuan ($319 billion).The market cap of Kweichow Moutai came in at 2.18 trillion yuan.As of Monday's closing, China Mobile's shares had risen 4.59 percent.Previously, China's largest oil and gas producer PetroChina, state-owned lender Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Kweichow Moutai had all ranked first in the onshore stock market at different times.\"The performance of China Mobile was within expectations, as its shares had been closing in on those of Kweichow Moutai since mid-March,\" Liu Dingding, a Beijing-based tech analyst, told the Global Times on Monday.With the nation's digital push on track, it is bound to boost demand at the infrastructure level where companies like China Mobile have abundant experience, Liu said.China will strengthen policymaking and institutional building, take forward-looking steps in building its digital infrastructure, foster the innovation and development of digital industries, speed up its digital transformation, upgrade digital public services, and deepen international cooperation, the National Development and Reform Commission, China's top economic planner, said in a statement earlier this month.A national plan for the overall layout of digital development was released in February, which said that important progress would be made in the construction of a digital China by 2025.By 2035, China will be at the global forefront in terms of digital development, and digital progress in the economic, political, cultural, social and environmental fields will be more coordinated and sufficient, according to the plan.\"As we can see from the changes of the most valuable firms on the A-share market, investors are rooting for the company that is better aligned with the nation's strategic deployment,\" Liu said.China Mobile's achievement is also inseparable from its own ability to make a profit.Climbing to the top of the market shows that its transformation from a traditional mobile operator to a technology-driven centrally administered state-owned enterprise in the digital economy over recent years has been well accepted by the market, according to Liu.Profit stood at 125.5 billion yuan last year, up 8 percent, and earnings per share stood at 5.88 yuan, according to an earnings statement in March. Its profitability remained in a leading position among top-tier global telecommunications operators.Chinese operators represented by China Mobile are showing new vitality in the mobile communication industry, and their new value is gradually being recognized by investors, experts said.In their 2022 financial reports, the three major operators - China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom - all emphasized cutting-edge technology concepts such as computing power networks and artificial intelligence, amid their efforts to downplay their operator labels and strengthen their attributes of technological innovation.Yang Jie, the company chairman, said during the earnings call that China Mobile's capabilities in natural language processing (neural networks), deep learning, machine vision and other aspects generated more than 3 billion yuan last year.\"We have now built a computing power network, which will definitely play a huge role in artificial intelligence computing power\u2026 In terms of operation, maintenance and customer service, China Mobile has realized the extensive use of artificial intelligence,\" Yang said.\"Investors can no longer look at China Unicom with old eyes, nor can they look at the information and communication industry with old eyes. Our company is transforming from a traditional operator into a technologically innovative enterprise embracing the digital economy,\" Liu Liehong, chairman of the company, said during its earnings call.China Mobile's rise to the leading A-share spot is related to the market's preference for a valuation system with Chinese characteristics, a term coined by China Securities Regulatory Commission Chairman Yi Huiman at the Financial Street Forum annual conference in November last year.As the reform of centrally administered SOEs steps up, the sentiment of the capital market has undergone a qualitative change, bringing values back to a reasonable level, Yang Delong, chief economist at Shenzhen-based First Seafront Fund Management Co, told the Global Times on Monday.\"The board featuring the valuation system has gained popularity among investors since the start of the year, and more and more indexes focused on centrally administered SOEs were born accordingly,\" Yang said.Hang Seng Indexes Co launched on Monday the Hang Seng China Central SOEs Index. The new index is a market-cap weighted index that reflects the overall performance of stocks listed in Hong Kong with Chinese centrally administered SOEs as the largest shareholder.",

            "description": "NewsBy Alice WadeLeading Port producer Symington Family Estates has made a rare edition of Graham\u2019s The Stone Terraces 2021 Vintage Port following a particularly good yield that year.The making of the micro-terroir wine is a rare decision by the Symington family who only ever produce it when the vines deliver wines of incomparable elegance and complexity. It is just the fifth of its kind following the 2011, 2015, 2016 and 2017 editions.Symington Family Estates has been a port producer in Northern Portugal since 1882 and spans five generations of winemakers. It is now a leading premium Port producer.The wine is produced from two relatively shaded blocks, one east-facing and the other north-facing. This combined with the schist stone terrace, gives a distinctive ability to store and contain the heat from the sun through the night, creating a gradual, homogenous ripening process.The two very cool exposures combine to create a wine with fresh, lifted aromas and hints of tropical fruit, characteristic of the unique terraces in which they are grown. It is concentrated whilst being supremely refined with polished tannins and taut acidity combining to deliver sublime elegance and balance, the brand said in a press release.Because of the cooler temperatures in the 2021 growth cycle, the conditions facilitated a slower, gradual maturation of fruit with balanced ripening.The stone terraces are planted mostly with mature Touriga Nacional and a few younger plantings including Touriga Franca, Sous\u00e3o and Alicante Bouschet. Grapes from these vines were then picked at the same time and co-fermented to enhance complexity, structure, and freshness.Only 4,800 75cl bottles and 280 tappit hens (225cl bottles which are named for their likeness to a hen\u2019s crest) will be made, representing a mere 2% of the years\u2019 total production at Quinta dos Malvedos.Charles Symington, the company\u2019s head winemaker, said of the terroir: \u201cThe hand-built stone terraces at Quinta dos Malvedos have long been prized by my family for producing wines with an incredibly unique profile, which is entirely distinct from the rest of the estate.\u201dThe Stone Terraces 2021 Vintage Port will be bottled in May and be available from mid-June 2023.",

            "description": "shareLink copied toclipboardThe 420 Day is unofficially the World Marijuana Day, and we look at the possible origins of this dayCannabis stocks have been falling, but there\u2019s still a lot of promiseWe take a look at the cannabis stocks on the ASX over the past weekThe date April 20th has become an unofficial holiday among cannabis enthusiasts who call it the World Marijuana Day.The day is also affectionately known simply as \u2018420\u2032, and is celebrated by weed-smokers around the globe and promoted in songs by bands like The Grateful Dead.Nobody really knows about its origin and why this specific date was chosen to pay tribute to marijuana.One theory is that 420 originated from a police code used to denote marijuana use.Another theory takes us to April 20th 1995 Vancouver, where 200 cannabis consumers gathered and smoked weed to protest and demand its decriminalisation.Yet another accepted theory takes us to San Rafael High School in Marian County California in the 1970s, where a group of students used code \u201c420\u2033 to refer to their after-school weed smoking sessions at 4.20pm.The five students called themselves the \u201cWaldos,\u201d which referenced the wall they would sit on at their school.The origin of the Waldos has been documented in letters, military records, and high school newspaper clippings to corroborate these origins.Whichever story you believe, cannabis firms and investors have been struggling to toast 420 over the past couple of years as cannabis stocks have been falling.The largest cannabis ETF, the US$322 million-sized Pure US Cannabis ETF (MSOS), is down 87% over the past two years, and 24% this year alone.The ETF underperforms the benchmark US S&P 500 index by a massive 87% the past two years, and 33% this year.Weed sector still has a lot of runwayJosh Gilbert, a market analyst at eToro, said the fall of listed cannabis shares has mainly been driven by a couple of key factors.\u201cThere has been a lot of disappointment from the sector at the lack of movement towards Federal decriminalisation of cannabis in the US, likely the world\u2019s largest market,\u201d said Gilbert.\u201cSecondly, it has failed to grow at the rate many predicted, and this is illustrated by how small it still is compared to other \u2018sin\u2019 sectors.\u201dTo illustrate, the largest cannabis stock right now is Canada\u2019s Curaleaf, with a market cap of around US$1.5 billion.When compared to the alcohol industry, China\u2019s Shanghai-listed Kweichow Moutai has a market cap of around US$330 billion, and in tobacco, US\u2019 Philip Morris has a market cap of US$150 billion.Gilbert also believes there is more hope for the weed industry under a Democratic President, and warns that it may dwindle further if Republicans are back in office in 2024.\u201cHowever, we should also note that the long-term trend is still towards state-level liberalisation in the US, with consumers becoming increasingly pro-legalisation, according to annual surveys,\u201d he said.European markets to pave the wayFor now, cannabis companies will continue to be hit by costs arising from the complex patchwork of US state and federal laws, while sector growth is restricted.But the sector holds of a lot of promise, with pro-legalisation attitudes continuing to grow in the US.In Europe, Germany is already on the verge of decriminalising and allowing limited recreational use.The new legislation in Germany will allow those aged 21 and over to legally obtain up to 25 grams of cannabis per day from non-profit members\u2019 clubs, with a monthly limit of 50 grams \u2013 but they can\u2019t be consumed on club premises.The German government has justified its new laws by claiming that they will effectively eliminate black markets and organised crime.Malta is the only other country in Europe to have legalised recreational cannabis.Across the rest of the continent however, decriminalisation rather than full legislation has been more the norm so far.\u201cGermany is set to lead the way in Europe by decriminalising its use, and this could make some of the leaders in this sector a promising long-term investment,\u201d Gilbert added.To ASX Weed Stocks \u2026.Code Company Price % Year % Six Month % Month % Week Market Cap LV1 Live Verdure Ltd 0.18 -33.33 9.09 16.13 20.00 $15,256,630 IDT

Jednak osoby, kt\u00f3re zainwestowa\u0142y w akcje zwi\u0105zane z rynkiem marihuany, nie maj\u0105 wielu powod\u00f3w do \u015bwi\u0119towania. Wszystko przez ogromne oczekiwania wobec bran\u017cy, kt\u00f3rych nie uda\u0142o si\u0119 do tej pory zrealizowa\u0107.W Polsce od kilku lat istnieje mo\u017cliwo\u015b\u0107 korzystania z medycznej marihuany. Jednak temat legalizacji rekreacyjnego jej za\u017cywania nadal pozostaje poza g\u0142\u00f3wnym nurtem publicznych dyskusji. W USA i Europie Zachodniej jest jednak inaczej. W Stanach Zjednoczonych badania opinii publicznej, jak i nastawianie cz\u0119\u015bci polityk\u00f3w, jest przychylne legalizacji marihuany na poziomie federalnym. Zanim to si\u0119 stanie, legalizacj\u0119 przeprowadzaj\u0105 poszczeg\u00f3lne stany \u2013 w 38 legalna jest jej medyczna odmiana, a w 21 \u2013 rekreacyjna. Wed\u0142ug statystyk, obecnie 16 proc. Amerykan\u00f3w przyznaje si\u0119 do korzystania z marihuany. Dla por\u00f3wnania, 11 proc. pali papierosy, a 45 proc. pije alkohol.W Europie, punktem zwrotnym w my\u015bleniu o marihuanie i biznesie z ni\u0105 zwi\u0105zanym b\u0119dzie jej legalizacja w Niemczech. Realizacja tego postulatu to element umowy koalicyjnej mi\u0119dzy SPD, Zielonymi i FDP, stanowi\u0105cej podstaw\u0119 dzia\u0142a\u0144 rz\u0105du Olafa Scholza. Legalizacja by\u0142a priorytetem rz\u0105du, jednak prace nad ni\u0105 zwolni\u0142y pod wp\u0142ywem pandemii i wojny. W zesz\u0142ym tygodniu, niemieckie w\u0142adze przedstawi\u0142y projekt rozwi\u0105za\u0144, kt\u00f3re jednak maj\u0105 charakter ograniczony wobec pierwotnych plan\u00f3w. Niemiecki rz\u0105d obawia si\u0119 bowiem, \u017ce dalej id\u0105ce rozwi\u0105zania mog\u0142yby spotka\u0107 si\u0119 ze sprzeciwem Unii Europejskiej lub by\u0107 niezgodne z prawem mi\u0119dzynarodowym. Obecna propozycja zak\u0142ada mo\u017cliwo\u015b\u0107 posiadania do 25g marihuany na w\u0142asny u\u017cytek, a tak\u017ce mo\u017cliwo\u015b\u0107 uprawy marihuany na w\u0142asne potrzeby; samodzielnie lub w formie przeznaczonych do tego klub\u00f3w. Te regulacje powinny wej\u015b\u0107 w \u017cycie w Niemczech po ich uchwaleniu przez Bundestag do ko\u0144ca tego roku.Proces legalizacji post\u0119puje jednak wolniej, ni\u017c oczekiwa\u0142by tego przemys\u0142 zwi\u0105zany z produkcj\u0105 i dystrybucj\u0105 legalnej marihuany. Te firmy ostatnio maj\u0105 mniej powod\u00f3w do \u015bwi\u0119towania \u2013 najwi\u0119kszy sektorowy fundusz ETF, Pure US Cannabis ETF (MSOS) o warto\u015bci 322 mln dolar\u00f3w, w ci\u0105gu ostatnich dw\u00f3ch lat straci\u0142 na warto\u015bci 87 proc., a 24 proc. tylko w tym roku. Jest to wynik gorszy od benchmarkowego ameryka\u0144skiego indeksu S&P 500 o 87 proc. w ci\u0105gu ostatnich dw\u00f3ch lat i 33 proc. w tym roku. Jednak sektor ten nadal jest obiecuj\u0105cy, bo wiele wskazuje, \u017ce procesu legalizacji marihuany na \u015bwiecie nie da si\u0119 ju\u017c zatrzyma\u0107.Notowane na gie\u0142dzie firmy z bran\u017cy konopi indyjskich do\u015bwiadczy\u0142y powa\u017cnych spadk\u00f3w z kilku powod\u00f3w. Bran\u017ca prze\u017cy\u0142a rozczarowanie brakiem ruchu w kierunku federalnej dekryminalizacji marihuany w USA, prawdopodobnie najwi\u0119kszym rynku na \u015bwiecie. Takie by\u0142y oczekiwania wzgl\u0119dem Demokratycznego prezydenta i administracji. Tym bardziej, \u017ce w roku 2024 w\u0142adza mo\u017ce przej\u015b\u0107 w r\u0119ce Republikan\u00f3w.Jednak nie mo\u017cemy zapomina\u0107, \u017ce w d\u0142ugim terminie postawy pro-legalizacyjne staj\u0105 si\u0119 coraz powszechniejsze w USA i na \u015bwiecie. Przyk\u0142adem tego s\u0105 obecne zmiany w Niemczech, kt\u00f3re mog\u0105 wp\u0142yn\u0105\u0107 na pojawienie si\u0119 podobnych rozwi\u0105za\u0144 w innych cz\u0119\u015bciach Europy.Na razie jednak, firmy zajmuj\u0105ce si\u0119 konopiami indyjskimi pozostaj\u0105 nara\u017cone na koszty wynikaj\u0105ce ze skomplikowanej mozaiki przepis\u00f3w stanowych i federalnych w USA, podczas gdy rozw\u00f3j sektora jest ograniczony. Nie ro\u015bnie on tak szybko jak przewidywano jeszcze kilka lat temu. W tym kontek\u015bcie warto wskaza\u0107, \u017ce najwi\u0119ksza gie\u0142dowa sp\u00f3\u0142ka sp\u00f3\u0142ka na rynku konopii (Curaleaf) ma kapitalizacj\u0119 wynosz\u0105c\u0105 7,3 mld z\u0142otych, podczas gdy w bran\u017cy alkoholowej, chi\u0144ski Kweichow Moutai ma kapitalizacj\u0119 rynkow\u0105 w wysoko\u015bci 1,36 bln z\u0142otych.

Najbardziej prawdopodobne jest, \u017ce 420 Day powsta\u0142 w Kalifornii w latach 70-tych, kiedy to grupa nastolatk\u00f3w z San Rafael High School w hrabstwie Marian zbiera\u0142a si\u0119 by pali\u0107 marihuan\u0119 o 4:20 ka\u017cdego dnia.

This can be an incentive for investors to look for emerging market funds with a lower correlation to China.Performance of MSCI China in the last three yearsThere are, however, arguments to have an exposure to China in a portfolio, either as a standalone or as a complement to a global emerging markets or Asia Pacific fund.In the short term, Chinese citizens are expected to spend the money they have saved during the three years of strict Covid restrictions.Catherine Yeung, investment director at Fidelity Asian Values PLC, said: \u201cAfter strict lockdowns, Chinese people want to meet, travel and spend money.\u201cIt is also worth noting that household savings rates in China have risen from 31% to 35%, so it\u2019s expected that a significant war chest will be channelled into the economy over the next few months.\u201dIn the long term, China aims to evolve from a hub for lower quality and low-cost products to an economic model focused on higher quality manufacturing and innovation.Trustnet has asked three fund selectors to pick a fund for investors looking to up their exposure to China.Carly Moorhouse, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot chose Fidelity China Consumer to benefit from the long-term transformation of the Chinese economy, as more people move into the middle class and spend their increased disposable incomes.She said: \u201cThe fund is managed by experienced portfolio manager Hyomi Jie who, outside of Covid restrictions, would undertake her own primary research, staying with a Chinese family in different parts of China every year for two weeks to better understand what they are consuming, in terms of both goods and services, as well as how they are doing so.\u201cThis proprietary research gives her a competitive edge in really understanding the nuances of this particular market.\u201dPerformance of fund over 10 years against sector and indexSource: FE AnalyticsThe fund outperformed both the IA China/Greater China sector as well as the MSCI China index over 10 years.Considering the theme of the fund, its overweights are consumer cyclical and consumer defensive. It also has sizeable allocations to communication services and financial services.China differs from developed markets as it trades three different types of shares. H-shares are traded on the Hong Kong stock exchange in Hong Kong Dollars and are accessible for any investor. The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges trade A-shares in Yuan and are the preserve of Chinese citizens. B-Shares are also traded in mainland China and can be bought and sold by foreigners.Jasper Thornton-Boelman, investment director at Parmenion prefers A-shares because they are less correlated to the wider emerging market universe than H-shares.He said that Parmenion uses Allianz China A Share Equity to gain a direct exposure to China, as it \u201cgives us a way to improve diversification, particularly in our higher risk models.\u201dOver 10 years, the MSCI China A Onshore index has a correlation ratio of 0.51 with the MSCI Emerging Markets. In comparison, the correlation ratio between the MSCI China and MSCI Emerging Markets is 0.77.Performance of fund over 10 years against sector and indexSource: FE AnalyticsAllianz China A Share Equity offers a direct exposure to the domestic Chinese stock market. The top five holdings are Kweichow Moutai, Citic Securities, Contemporary Amperex Technology, East Money Information and China Tourism Group Duty.There are also options for investors who want the best of both worlds.Lorenzo La Posta, fund manager at Momentum Global Investment Management (MGIM) selected the Hereford Bin Yuan Greater China CI , which MGIM uses as its main exposure to the Chinese equity market.He said: \u201cThe strategy is managed by an experienced team who have almost 20 years of live track record in the Chinese equity market and very good numbers to back that up.\u201cHeadquartered in Shanghai, they are well positioned to understand both the onshore and offshore segments. The company is fully employee-owned, which creates an alignment of interest that we like, particularly when investing with a team over the long run.\u201dPerformance of fund over 10 years against sector and indexSource: FE AnalyticsThe fund was launched in April 2018 and has outperformed both the MSCI China benchmark and the FO Equity \u2013 Greater China sector over the past two years.The majority of the fund\u2019s allocation (66%) is in A-shares but it also has a significant exposure (31%) to H-Shares.La Posta added that MGIM particularly likes the fund\u2019s efforts in integrating environmental, social and governance considerations in their investment process.",

            "description": "Brand loyalty is a key component to long-run success in consumer markets. However, Chinese Gen Z consumer behaviour increasingly suggests this is hard to establish with them. This is especially so in e-commerce. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) can help provide a solution to that challenge, but traditional loyalty programs based on points and \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d messages fall well short of what is necessary to achieve that.Online shoppers follow KOLs, not brands or platformsDuring the Double 11 campaign in 2022, 66% of consumers shopped across three or more platforms \u2013 including T-Mall, JD.com, Douyin (Chinese Tiktok), Vip.com, and Dewu, according to Bain & Company. This compares to 34% in 2021. There is very little loyalty to the platforms themselves.Chinese Gen Z consumer behaviour increasingly suggests this is hard to establish a brand loyalty them.Likewise, the tendency to be loyal to individual brands appears to be eroding also. There are examples and anecdotes plenty in the industry at the moment that will surely come through in the research shortly. One story of a well-known, high-performing outdoor brand losing 100% of its business on a particular online live-streaming studio when the KOL associated with that brand migrated to another studio and started pushing another outdoor brand is indicative of this trend.Whilst the days of superstar KOL live-streamers dominating the market seem largely behind us since the governmental regulation, KOLs are still plentiful and pivotal. They establish loyal followers who tune into them and purchase whatever they are promoting at that time. This too seems to be a trend: consumers waiting to be \u201cseeded\u201d by the KOL rather than having a deliberate shopping list.How do we, as brand owners and operators, navigate this landscape of shifting sands in terms of consumer shopping behaviours?This too seems to be a trend: consumers waiting to be \u201cseeded\u201d by the KOL rather than having a deliberate shopping list.Building a deeper connection with your consumersE-commerce platforms certainly seem to be viewing CRM as at least part of the solution. T-Mall\u2019s \u201c88 VIP\u201d program has in excess of 25 million members & the benefits offered are multi-faceted: coupons, priority delivery, and membership of other Alibaba programs all features. 50% of the GMV on T-Mall for Double 11 came from members. For JD.com the same figure is 43% for members of their program \u201cJD Plus\u201d. Clearly, these industry titans are taking CRM very seriously.For brands themselves, the dilemma is acute. Fully one-third of Chinese Gen Z consumers claim they have no brand loyalty as such. 86% say they will choose to buy from the brand that offers superior CRM benefits when comparing similar products across multiple brands.CRM, however, is a simple term that is not so simple to implement successfully. Brands must have a compelling proposition based on deep insight into their consumers which, in turn, must be rooted in data.Loyalty is built on 4 pillars:Financial bonds : value-based benefits that are worth having.: value-based benefits that are worth having. Structural bonds: a relationship that makes it easier to keep buying from the brand. Nike+ Run Club mobile app is a perfect example of this. It is designed to structurally bond to consumers\u2019 fitness routines. Providing tools such as GPS run tracking; audio-guided runs; weekly, monthly, and custom distance challenges; customised coaching plans for your goals; and non-stop motivation from your friends.To meaningfully cut through all of this noise brands should also invest in CRM but must do so holistically across the four pillars.Social bonds : the ability to create and share across platforms content that enhances social status/presence: the ability to create and share across platforms content that enhances social status/presence Emotional bonds: perhaps the trickiest of all \u2013 creating a relationship based on shared values and, thereby, a robust affinity with the brand. Adidas and Parley\u2019s Run for the Oceans is a global movement \u2013 for every 10 minutes of running recorded via the Adidas running community, Parley will clean up the equivalent weight of one plastic bottle from beaches, remote islands, and coastlines before it reaches the ocean. This strong purpose-led program keeps consumers coming back \u2013 it has united over 8.2 million runners worldwide, running a combined total of more than 81.7 million km since 2017.Going beyond the consumer and working with the right KOLsThere is a similar relationship that needs to be built with KOLs. It is far better to establish relationships with KOLs who have a genuine passion for the brand they are promoting. KOLs typically work on short-term contracts (3-6 months is the new norm) so locking them in financially and emotionally will help keep them on board.Overall, consumer loyalty is difficult to establish and even more difficult to maintain in the current environment. The e-commerce platforms recognize this and are investing heavily to build loyalty to their platforms. KOLs are also commanding consumer loyalties. To meaningfully cut through all of this noise brands should also invest in CRM but must do so holistically across the four pillars: financial, structural, social & emotional. Without all four pillars, the program will be on unsound foundations and will, ultimately, fail.Additional research by Gary Liu",

            "description": "China is witnessing the rise of a new artistic phenomenon among youngsters and art fanatics alike \u2013 the Guka sticker trend. To put it simply, \u201cGuka\u201d consists of decorating a card with stickers in a similar fashion as children who grew up between the 80s and 90s did on their desks and books during their childhood.Such stickers have been upgraded to a complete set of exquisite tools including Guka cards for decorating, tweezers, and tag chains to attach to the sticker card. According to one Guka user on Douyin (who is only 11 years old), the art form consists of three main steps: tear off, paste, and string.\u201cGuka\u201d consists of decorating a card with stickers in a similar fashion as children who grew up between the 80s and 90s did on their desks and books during their childhood.First, the user will have to tear off a layer of protective film on the surface of the Guka plate and then, using special tweezers, tear off their sticker of choice. Then, all the user has to do is place the torn sticker on the plate and use their imagination to arrange and combine patterns to create their ideal design or visual story. The last step is to string a small chain to the card in order to hang it for display or attach it to school bags.In terms of pricing, the price has risen from a few cents to tens of dollars. One Guka card priced at 19.9 RMB (2.89 USD) was able to amass 2 million RMB (290,756 USD) in sales from Douyin alone. According to data from Xindou, estimated sales from Guka-related products in one month alone garnered more than one million RMB (145,378 USD). On Taobao, the most expensive Guka set amounts to nearly 400 RMB (58.15 USD).Image: Guka posts on XiaohongshuMiniso has also leaned into the trend, pairing up with Disney to release special edition stickers featuring characters from Toy Story and Monsters Inc.From Disney China\u2019s LinaBell and Duffy and Friends to Sanrio\u2019s character Kuromi, the sticker trend has blown up among elementary school children on Chinese social media. On Xiaohongshu specifically, the topic \u201cGuka\u201d has garnered more than 610,000 notes with 250 million views. Meanwhile, the respective hashtag amassed 2.45 billion views on China\u2019s leading short video platform Douyin.Even parents have become huge proponents of this trend and regard it as an excellent way for their children to use their time (and brains) instead of reverting to playing on their mobile phones all the time.

            "description": "For a long time, burning incense and worshipping in front of Buddha, was regarded as a superstitious activity that was only practiced by elders in China. But now the younger generations are adopting the ritual in China\u2019s ancient temples. Instead of praying for a sweet relationship, securing a job and future prosperity in their careers have become priorities amongst these young devout worshippers.Tourism attractions born from temples and monasteries across the nation saw a more than three-fold increase in bookings since the beginning of this year, with visitors of the post-90s and post-00s accounting for nearly half of the total footfall since February as per the Chinese online travel agency Ctrip.Securing a job and future prosperity in their careers have become priorities amongst these young devout worshippers.The most sought-after amid the temple feverAmong them, Yonghe Temple, is a special place for these young pilgrims. There is \u201cnothing more efficacious\u201d than the lamasery that once stood as the official residence for Yongzheng (one of the most diligent emperors in Chinese history) before he ascended the throne. The emperor\u2019s dedicated spirit is believed to be a lucky charm for young people who are seeking to progress into the next chapter of their professional lives.With good tidings from former adorers who received job opportunities after their visits to Yonghe Temple circulating on social media, it has become even more sacred amongst young Chinese and soon emerged as a popular attraction on the internet, propelling the hashtag \u201cYonghe Temple\u201d to garner more than 150 million views on China\u2019s lifestyle-sharing platform Xiaohongshu, where 72% of its over 200 million monthly active users are post-90s.The emperor\u2019s dedicated spirit is believed to be a lucky charm for young people who are seeking to advance their professional lives.Image: Visitors worship at Yonghe Temple/XiaohongshuEmerging businesses brought out by templegoersWhile posts that show queues outside the lamasery in the early hours continue to be commonplace in March, others are sharing their experience including tips on the best pray practices and details of \u201crules\u201d on burning incense for temple goers who are praying for different reasons, such as passing exams or getting university or job offers. Also trending in the searches are accessories, including Buddha hand chains and necklaces. Normally made of coloured glaze, jade, or wood, these ritualistic items, known amongst worshippers as \u6cd5 ( f\u01ce ) \u7269 ( w\u00f9 ) , are a must-buy after a visit, or in their words \u8bf7 ( q\u01d0ng ) \u56de ( hu\u00ed ) , which means bringing [wishes] back with them, which is deemed a crucial process to make them come true.This religious enthusiasm not only boosted sales of these \u201cmagic items\u201d both offline at the temple and on e-commerce platforms, but also the business of substitute ritual item buyers, or \u201c \u4ee3 ( d\u00e0i ) \u8bf7 ( q\u01d0ng ) \u6cd5 ( f\u01ce ) \u7269 ( w\u00f9 ) \u201d. The Daigou behaviour, where individuals purchase products for those who cannot visit in person while making a profit, has pushed the price of accessories from around one hundred Yuan to more than a thousand, further fuelling the already heated debate around the new obsession of young people.Image: Users share accessories they bought after visiting Yonghe Temple/XiaohongshuOnline debate over young devoteesThe temple fad soon turned into a social media sensation with several relevant hashtags, including \u201cWhy has temple tourism become a hit?\u201d and \u201cMedia commentary on why young people don\u2019t go to class, don\u2019t have a \u2018go-get\u2019 attitude but go pray in a temple\u201d, drawing in over 100 million and 130 million views within 24 hours on 21 March.Media reporting with a patronising tone, such as the one by The Beijing News, sparked anger amongst the young generations. The publisher indicates that \u201cyoung people should clearly distinguish between the imaginary and real worlds. If one banks on Gods to realise their hopes, they are going astray.\u201d Some criticism they are being met with is that they are \u201cdeparting from the general public and have no understanding of the hardships facing the ordinary\u201d, with a reference to a fiercer job market alongside other social challenges involving family pressure, marriage, and parenting.\u201cWe need some spiritual aspects as reassurance and motivation before we go back to fight reality.\u201dEmpathetic media analysis soon arrived, prompting confessions from young netizens, such as one commenting, \u201cTo some extent, this is a tragedy of this generation. Uncertain about their future, not looking at science and turning to supernatural beings. Do we like it? No. Because the dark night is too long and there is no light in sight.\u201dWhile societal problems such as work pressure, low pay, low marriage rates, and an ever-declining birth rate have become the status quo amongst the young demographics, the sudden temple fever mirrors the deteriorating dilemma in China\u2019s employment market post-pandemic. The country\u2019s urban youth unemployment rate hit a record high of 19.9% in July 2022. While an estimated influx of 11.58 million fresh graduates in 2023 is expected to escalate the battle even more, the economy which was traumatised by the pandemic is yet to provide a solution for these eager job hunters.\u201cYoung people need somewhere to let go of their feelings,\u201d one comment reads, \u201c[the Zen ambiance] it provides a space for us to escape and feel relief,\u201d followed another. \u201cI know it\u2019s not real, but we need some spiritual aspects as reassurance and motivation before we go back to fight reality.\u201d",

            "description": "About a hundred years ago, French couturier Coco Chanel pioneered women\u2019s trousers and revolutionised the course of women\u2019s fashion. Her challenging move and defiance of gender norms has inspired so many and passed through generations. Fast forward to 2020, English singer Harry Styles broke the Internet when he appeared on the cover of Vogue in a Gucci dress, further igniting the gender-neutral sensation.Today, younger generations intend to break down social stereotypes of gender identity being either male or female to embrace expressions of individuality and gender fluidity. And thus, led to the ever-increasing favourability of unisex fashion, with gender-neutral outfit topics drawing in over 200 million views on Xiaohongshu, China\u2019s largest lifestyle-sharing platform. This trend was also demonstrated in a report disclosed by CBNData in 2018, China\u2019s marketing platform, where up to 40% of men\u2019s clothing was purchased by female consumers, and sales of gender-neutral fashion products surged by 341%.Younger generations intend to break down social stereotypes of gender identity being either male or female.To capture the demanding market need for diversity, China\u2019s unisex fashion brand \u2018Bosie\u2019 made its first appearance in 2018, aiming to provide ready-to-wear for all gender identities, age groups, and social statuses to express their unique personalities. This edgy brand positioning successfully won over consumers\u2019 hearts, enabling Bosie to make its name in the clothing industry. They have garnered over 2.4 million views on Xiaohongshu as of 28 January and witnessed stable growth in sales of 200% in three conservative years, exceeding 700 million RMB (84.4 million USD) in 2021.What makes Bosie so successful?Bosie is not the first brand to launch gender-neutral clothing in order to hop onto the emerging fashion wave. In 2020, Gucci unveiled a dress for male consumers which was met with wide criticism due to its undesirable design and high price point. The same thing happened to Zara as well.For Bosie, the brand first took body shape differences between genders into consideration, focusing on the development of loose-fitting clothing categories such as hoodies and polos but with a creative flair to tailor to the novel tastes of the young demographics. Take one puffer jacket for example, the transparent outer layer was divided into grids so you can insert different accessories. This not only displays a strong streak of playfulness but also provides consumers with the opportunity to customise and make the jacket unique.Bosie evolved into a label that represents the spectrum of gender in a more inclusive and realistic way.By understanding that the Gen Z cohort never define themselves with only one style and changes outfits according to their moods, this has led to Bosie producing a host of collections in different styles. With the collections being gender-neutral, this better resonates with other aesthetics and emotional factors, such as futuristic, cyberpunk, minimalist, and so much more.In contrast to most unisex brands that solely use black, white, and grey as their main colour palette, Bosie has capitalised on bright colours to deliver a vibrant presence.Despite the aforementioned competencies, as a genderless brand, Bosie needs to tackle the increased possibility of outfit clashes. To resolve this issue, Bosie doubled down the production rate, displayed new styles frequently and standardised the whole process. By doing so, Bosie evolved into a label that represents the spectrum of gender in a more inclusive and realistic way, whilst possessing the edge of both a designer and a fast fashion brand.How did Bosie achieve this?First and foremost, Bosie has consistently collaborated with classic cartoon characters since it was founded, with The Little Prince, Natsume\u2019s Book of Friends, Doraemon, and Toy Story included. The Little Prince collection was adored by a great number of consumers and achieved sales of 40 million RMB (5.76 million USD).These cartoon characters easily evoke positive sentiments of nostalgia for the post-80s, the 90s, and even 00s, which perfectly coincides with the brand\u2019s target consumer groups. By doing so, Bosie can effectively divert online traffic and build up an emotional relationship with consumers.Bosie has consistently collaborated with classic cartoon characters since it was founded.Whilst developing its online channels, Bosie also took their endeavours offline by opening storefronts in Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities like Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hangzhou and Wuhan. Implementing omnichannel strategies to provide consumers with integrated shopping experiences, optimised stock levels, and improved inventory management.It\u2019s worth noting that, most of the brick-and-mortar shops are covered in silver grey with metallic line designs to illustrate a futuristic theme, with a focus on providing consumers with refreshing shopping experiences instead of propelling consumption. Among all the stores, the one in Shanghai is the most popular as it hosts activities on a regular basis and has a corner dedicatedly mapped out for pets.In 2021, in celebration of the brand\u2019s three-year anniversary, Bosie released the brand\u2019s first advertisement video \u2018The Era of Bosie\u2019, embodying the brand spirit through a human image in a virtual world, vividly exemplifying the genderless mission.Looking back at the brand\u2019s promotional strategies, such as the unveiling of the unisex fashion concept, initiating constant collaborative activities and the setup of a virtual community, this has not only drawn in consumer attention with impressive visual elements but also displayed the brand\u2019s dedication and open-mindedness.What\u2019s next?After Bosie raised its profile, the unisex fashion trend has become the new fashion craze with more and more brands foraying into this marketplace. Beaster has become one of the top competitors, chartering its expansion in 7 cities and opening over 13 flagship stores. In comparison to its contenders, Bosie\u2019s price-setting is relatively higher. As such, its new goal is to \u201cbe the most cost-effective among designer brands, while being the most exclusive among fast-fashion peers\u201d.In the future, the brand is seeking out a balance between niche aesthetics and mass business.In order to make Bosie visible to a wide, young audience who are not in the centre of fashion, the unisex brand is eyeing the vast potential of China\u2019s lower-tier cities. In the words of Bosie\u2019s founder, Guangyao Liu, \u201cour generation is developing aesthetics at a fast pace with the help of domestic social media platforms, while the style of most clothing brands in Tier-3 and Tier-4 cities are relatively out of date which leads to immense opportunities waiting to be carved out.\u201dIt\u2019s been 5 years since Bosie opened up the market and started capitalising on the gender-neutral concept. In the future, the brand is seeking out a balance between niche aesthetics and mass business, whilst trying new categories that \u2018our consumers are in favour of\u2019. Bosie is receptive to emerging styles for the different consumer groups and also to the consideration of future brand development, which is completely aligned with Bosie\u2019s slogan \u2013 beyond boundaries.",

            "description": "IFTM Comments is a partnership between Macau News Agency and Macao Institute for Tourism StudiesBy Kitty, Fong Kit Sam and Loretta, Tou Un IengAfter three years of pandemic, we have finally entered its last stage. Vaccination passports and nucleic acid test requirements are gradually becoming optional. Boarders and gates in most countries have been opened and most have starter to welcome tourists again. People\u2019s movement is becoming active once more and people are expecting to go back to their normal daily life prior to pandemic.This epidemic has alerted people that vaccination might be necessary, yet good health is also essential in our lives. Therefore, some people choose to eat healthily; others see the importance to exercise more in order to enhance their immune system and keep their body fit simultaneously. Consequently, more fitness centres and private trainers have appeared in the market. Some entrepreneurs may consider this as an opportunity. Nevertheless, there is no absolute answer yet.Kitty, Fong Kit Sam, lecturer at IFTMLoretta, Tou Un Ieng, lecturer at IFTMDuring these three years, advanced technology has also changed the original norm in this industry. The traditional thought of exercising in fitness centres should be that customers physically have workouts with the machines in an open area or studios. There are some qualified and experienced trainers to assist and accompany customers when they are in need. However, with technology, when people like to exercise, they no longer need to go to a physical centre. Online mode has become more popular and common nowadays. Live streaming is always available on social media platforms; people can exercise based on their own availability, regardless of the place and time.The abovementioned has led the physical fitness centres into difficulty, and the following are the challenges they are encountering.1) High operating expenses \u2013 since physical fitness centres need a physical location and facilities, even during the lockdown periods, the operating expenses of a centre have to be paid in full.2) Low cost and high flexibility to customers \u2013 it is easy to access the internet with low cost and higher flexibility, so some people are more willing to have their training trials online.3) Word-of-mouth \u2013 as students are intensely loyal to the trainers, it makes for a situation where if the reputation of the trainers is good and s/he is famous, many students like to learn from them and be their followers. Some KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders) are good at spreading their names quickly by having gimmicks on the internet as the coverage of the population is extensive. They can make themselves well-known and get more students/followers within a short period.4) Importance of professional qualifications of trainers \u2013 most people may choose their trainers by studying the successful cases they observe from others. They may not be concerned with or understand different types of professional certificates in this field. Not too many people would seriously check the professional qualifications and certificates of their trainers, especially those popular KOL trainers on social media.Undoubtedly, when people care about their health and realize the value of exercising, it is an opportunity for fitness centres. However, how to respond to this opportunity and overcome the challenges would be critical. Firstly, when traditional fitness centres are combined with technology, a hybrid mode can be offered. Both online and offline modes can be assessed concurrently. By doing this, the existing facilities in the centre can be fully utilized and flexible services can also be provided to the customers. Secondly, providing value-added services, such as the consultation for a healthy diet, can be included in the fitness package so as to increase the loyalty of customers. Lastly, fitness centres can also use social media for advertising their personal trainers and services as promotional platforms.",

In 2021, the scale of China's digital economy totaled 45.5 trillion yuan, accounting for 39.8 percent of the national economy and almost doubling the 22.6 trillion yuan seen in 2016, according to an industry report by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology.According to a blueprint and timeline for the construction of a \"digital China\" through strengthening 5G and computing, released in late February, the digital infrastructure will be efficiently connected through a broad range of sectors, China will become a global leader in digital innovations by 2025 and the level of digital development in China will enter the forefront of the world by 2035.Telecom operators have a pivotal role to play in China's digital infrastructure rollout, experts said.In 2022, China rolled out 887,000 new 5G base stations, and the total number of 5G stations has reached 2.312 million today, accounting for more than 60 percent of the world's total, data from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology showed.On March 1, Jin Zhuanglong, minister of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said China will formulate an industry development plan to promote research and innovation of 6G mobile technologies, sending a clear message of the nation's determination to lead the trend of the cutting-edge technology.This year's Government Work Report said that China will strive to develop the digital economy, in a more affirmative tone than \"encouraging the development of digital economy\" in the text of 2022 version.",

Il n\u2019y avait plus que deux avions d\u2019Air France par semaine, l\u2019un vers P\u00e9kin, l\u2019autre vers Shanghai. Comme ils \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s vite remplis, il fallait traquer les places disponibles. En ao\u00fbt dernier, j\u2019ai trouv\u00e9 un si\u00e8ge dans un avion de la compagnie chinoise Xiamen Airlines effectuant la liaison Amsterdam-Xiamen. J\u2019ai voyag\u00e9 en classe \u00e9conomie: j\u2019ai pris ce qui \u00e9tait disponible! Je suis rest\u00e9 dix-sept heures dans cet avion. Au d\u00e9collage, nous avons attendu deux heures, le temps de sortir les valises de ceux qui n\u2019avaient pas pu monter \u00e0 bord. A l\u2019arriv\u00e9e, nous avons \u00e9galement patient\u00e9 quatre heures avant de d\u00e9barquer parce qu\u2019un autre avion \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 avant le n\u00f4tre: tester tout le monde prenait beaucoup de temps.Publicit\u00e9Publicit\u00e9A bord, l\u2019\u00e9quipage avait enfil\u00e9 des combinaisons de protection pour \u00e9viter tout contact avec les passagers. On ne nous a pas servi de repas ou de boissons. On nous a juste donn\u00e9 un sac en plastique avec un peu de pain, des oranges et quelques bricoles. Mais personne n\u2019a mang\u00e9 car tout le monde craignait d\u2019attraper le Covid.Le pire qui pouvait vous arriver, c\u2019\u00e9tait d\u2019\u00eatre test\u00e9 positif \u00e0 l\u2019arriv\u00e9e.

Il \u00e9tait tout neuf et con\u00e7u sp\u00e9cialement. La chambre \u00e9tait grande, propre et bien \u00e9clair\u00e9e. Les meilleures conditions que j\u2019ai jamais eues!

            "description": "Domestic briberyLegal frameworkDescribe the individual elements of the law prohibiting bribery of a domestic public official.In general, providing, soliciting or accepting a bribe for the purpose of or in return for securing illegitimate benefits constitutes an offence. Conspiring to commit offences under the Criminal Law is also an offence, as is the use of an intermediary to facilitate a bribe.Under the Criminal Law, individuals and entities are prohibited from:providing advantages to state personnel (articles 389 and 393) or a state organ, state-owned enterprise, institution or people\u2019s organisation (article 391) to obtain illegitimate benefits (article 391 is a unique entity offence, which prohibits the bribing of an entity, but not of an employee or affiliated person of an entity);providing kickbacks or service charges to state personnel (articles 389 and 393) or a state organ, state-owned enterprise, institution or people\u2019s organisation (article 391) in violation of state provisions;bribing close relatives of, or any person close to, state personnel (including ex-state personnel) (article 390(1));facilitating the bribery of state personnel (article 392); andproviding advantages to foreign officials (or international public organisation officials) to secure illegitimate commercial benefits (article 164).\u2018Bribes\u2019 under the Criminal Law are defined as \u2018money or tangible property and other advantages that can be calculable in money\u2019. Section 12 of the April 2016 judicial interpretation stipulates that \u2018property\u2019 includes:money;goods;property benefits, including benefits that can be converted into material benefits involving money, such as house renovations and debt exemptions; andother benefits involving financial payments, such as membership services and travel.De minimis thresholdsThere are minimum thresholds above which prosecutions can be brought. The April 2016 judicial interpretation is not comprehensive, but generally increases the minimum thresholds for criminal prosecution regarding graft. As regards bribe-giving, the threshold for crimes committed in the public sector is generally 30,000 yuan for individuals and 200,000 yuan for corporates.As regards private sector bribery offences, on 29 April 2022, the Supreme People\u2019s Procuratorate and the Ministry of Public Security issued new regulations which, among other things, reduced the minimum threshold for private sector offences, establishing a new threshold of 30,000 yuan for individuals (halved from 60,000 yuan) and 200,000 yuan for corporate entities.Bribes can be aggregated to meet these thresholds; if small bribes are provided regularly, the monetary thresholds will likely be met eventually.Mens rea and lack of quid pro quo requirementCorrupt intent is required for most criminal bribery offences (ie, specific intent to secure illegitimate benefits).Intent can be inferred from the circumstances of a case and there is no strict requirement to establish a quid pro quo. Relevant factors when inferring intent include:the relationship between the giver and the recipient of the bribe;the value of the advantages offered; andwhether the giver took advantage of the recipient\u2019s position, considering the purpose, timing and manner of the advantage.Scope of prohibitionsDoes the law prohibit both the paying and receiving of a bribe?The law prohibits both the providing (paying) and accepting (receiving) of a bribe.Definition of a domestic public officialHow does your law define a domestic public official, and does that definition include employees of state-owned or state-controlled companies?\u2018State personnel\u2019 is the local term for a (domestic) public official.The term \u2018state personnel\u2019 is expressly defined in the Criminal Law as \u2018personnel engaged in public services in state organs\u2019 and includes the following:personnel engaged in public administration in state organs, such as government officials or the officials of the Communist Party of China;personnel engaged in public services in state-owned enterprises (SOEs), institutions and social organisations;personnel in public services dispatched by the government, SOEs or institutions to non-state-owned corporations, enterprises, institutions, and social organisations; andother personnel engaged in public services according to the Law.Therefore, provided that they are engaged in public services, all personnel working in state-owned or state-controlled companies will be state personnel. Although there is no legal definition of \u2018engaged in public services\u2019, based on the Minutes of the Conference of the National Courts on Commercial Crimes issued by the Supreme People\u2019s Court in 2003, it includes having a role in organising, leading, supervising and managing SOEs and other state-related entities. \u2018Public service\u2019, in turn, mainly refers to public affairs relating to a person\u2019s position and duties, and other activities relating to the supervision and management of state-owned assets.Gifts, travel and entertainmentDescribe any restrictions on providing domestic officials with gifts, travel expenses, meals or entertainment. Do the restrictions apply to both the providing and the receiving of such benefits?Various government organs and departments, including the State Council and Communist Party of China, have issued internal anti-corruption rules and regulations governing state personnel. Although these rules and regulations do not apply to bribe-givers, they are a useful guide for determining suitable limits on offering gifts and business hospitality.The context must always be assessed to determine whether a gift, hospitality, travel and training constitute bribes. Factors to consider when distinguishing a lawful advantage from a bribe include:the background of the deal;the relationship between the offeror and the recipient (eg, whether they are relatives or friends, or have, or have had dealings);the value of the advantages offered;whether the offeror seeks illegitimate benefits by taking advantage of the recipient\u2019s position, considering the purpose, timing and manner of delivering the advantages; andwhether the recipient seeks illegitimate benefits for the offeror by taking advantage of his or her position.According to the relevant rules (some of which are non-binding), the following are considered unacceptable:offering cash gifts or their equivalent (eg, securities with cash value, payment vouchers and commercial prepaid cards) to government officials in the context of their public service activities;providing gifts (regardless of their value) to government officials that could influence their impartiality in performing their public functions;obtaining, holding or using consumer cards for \u2013 among other things \u2013 gyms, club and golf courses, in violation of the relevant rules (in accordance with the Regulation of the Communist Party of China on Disciplinary Actions, which is binding on Party members); anddonating vehicles to other parties (if done by enterprises, public institutions or government individuals).In general, high-value lavish gifts (eg, cars and luxury watches) are likely to attract scrutiny, particularly where the company or individual in question has dealings with the recipient. In light of applicable rules, lower-value gifts should also be approached with caution, particularly if they are one of several or are combined with the provision of other benefits.Entertainment and hospitality offered with corrupt intent (eg, in exchange for action or inaction by government officials regarding their duties; or in return for business opportunities or other economic interest offered in violation of the fair competition principle) are prohibited. Corrupt intent can be inferred from other factors, such as the giver\u2019s relationship with the proposed recipient (eg, if they have dealings) and the value and frequency of the hospitality offered. Lavish or unreasonably generous or frequent entertainment is likely to be problematic.The restrictions apply to both providing and receiving such benefits.Facilitating paymentsHave the domestic bribery laws been enforced with respect to facilitating or \u2018grease\u2019 payments?There are no rules under Chinese law comparable to those of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, under which a giver is exempt from liability for providing facilitation or \u2018grease\u2019 payments. However, article 389 of the Criminal Law provides that \u2018any person who offers money or property to a state employee under extortion but gains no illegitimate benefits shall not be regarded as offering bribes.\u2019Public official participation in commercial activitiesWhat are the restrictions on a domestic public official participating in commercial activities while in office?Article 59 of the Civil Servant Law states that a civil servant (defined as \u2018functionaries that perform public duties according to the law, that occupy the administrative staffing number of the state, and whose wages and welfare are assumed by the public finance of the state\u2019) shall not carry out or participate in profit-making activities in violation of the relevant provisions or concurrently hold a post in an enterprise or another profit-making organisation.Article 27 of the Regulation on the Disciplinary Actions against Civil Servants of Administrative Organs stipulates that a civil servant who engages in profit-making activities, or holds a concurrent position in an enterprise or any other profit-making organisation, shall be given a demerit or gross demerit. For serious cases, he or she shall be given disciplinary action of demotion, dismissal from office or expulsion, depending on the gravity of the circumstances.Payments through intermediaries or third partiesIn what circumstances do the laws prohibit payments through intermediaries or third parties to domestic public officials?Under the Criminal Law, the use of an intermediary to facilitate a bribe is prohibited. The Anti-unfair Competition Law includes liability for bribes paid through certain parties.Individual and corporate liabilityCan both individuals and companies be held liable for violating the domestic bribery rules?Yes, both individuals and companies can be held liable for corruption offences. In particular, corporations can be held criminally liable for bribing officials or officials of international public organisations.Corporate criminal liability generally attaches where the relevant bribery misconduct is an exercise of \u2018corporate will\u2019 (ie, the decision to engage in the misconduct was a group decision or was made by the relevant personnel in charge). The authorities may also consider whether the corporate entity provided an advantage or received an illegitimate benefit when assessing corporate liability.Private commercial briberyTo what extent does your country\u2019s domestic anti-bribery law also prohibit private commercial bribery?In general, providing, soliciting or accepting a bribe for the purpose of or in return for securing illegitimate benefits constitutes an offence. Conspiring to commit offences under the Criminal Law is also an offence, as is the use of an intermediary to facilitate a bribe.Under the Criminal Law, non-state personnel of a company, an enterprise or any other unit are prohibited from:accepting advantages from individuals or entities to secure illegitimate benefits where the amount is relatively large (article 164);soliciting or accepting advantages from others by taking advantage of their position and seeking benefits for those that provided the advantages in return, where the amount is relatively large (article 163); oraccepting kickbacks or service charges during economic activities by taking advantage of their position, in violation of state provisions (article 163).\u2018Advantages\u2019 under the Criminal Law are defined as \u2018money or tangible property and other advantages that can be calculable in money\u2019. Section 12 of the April 2016 judicial interpretation stipulates that \u2018property\u2019 includes:money;goods;property benefits, including benefits that can be converted into material benefits involving money, such as house renovations and debt exemptions; andother benefits involving financial payments, such as membership services and travel.De minimis thresholdsOn 29 April 2022, the Supreme People\u2019s Procuratorate and the Ministry of Public Security issued new regulations which, among other things, reduced the minimum threshold for private sector bribery offences, establishing a new threshold of 30,000 yuan for individuals (halved from 60,000 yuan) and 200,000 yuan for corporate entities.Bribes can be aggregated to meet these thresholds; if small bribes are provided regularly, the monetary thresholds will likely be met eventually.Mens rea and lack of quid pro quo requirementCorrupt intent is required for most criminal bribery offences (ie, specific intent to secure illegitimate benefits).Intent can be inferred from the circumstances of a case and there is no strict requirement to establish a quid pro quo. Relevant factors when inferring intent include:the relationship between the giver and the recipient of the bribe;the value of the advantages offered; andwhether the giver took advantage of the recipient\u2019s position, considering the purpose, timing and manner of the advantage.Anti-unfair Competition Law offencesIf the alleged bribery involves commercial entities and does not meet the criminal liability threshold, it may nevertheless violate the civil commercial bribery provisions under the Anti-unfair Competition Law (as amended). Article 7 of the Law prohibits a business operator from bribing the following three types of bribe recipient with property or by other means with a view to seeking transaction opportunities or a competitive edge:employees of the transaction counterparty;entities or individuals entrusted by the transaction counterparty to handle relevant affairs; orentities or individuals that use authority or influence to influence a transaction.In this regard, the Anti-unfair Competition Law does not prohibit the payment of commissions by a company or individual, provided that they are expressly provided in the course of the transaction and accurately recorded in the accounts of both parties to the transaction.The Anti-unfair Competition Law assumes vicarious liability of the company where its employees commit bribery under that Law. However, the company has a defence if it can prove that the act of offering bribes is irrelevant to securing a deal or gaining a competitive advantage by the company.For the purposes of the Anti-unfair Competition Law, \u2018bribe\u2019 is very widely interpreted and covers promotion fees, advertising expenses, sponsorship fees, service remuneration, commission or reimbursement of various expenses, as well as \u2018other means\u2019 such as trips or visits (overseas or domestic) of various descriptions.DefencesWhat defences and exemptions are available to those accused of domestic bribery violations?Most Criminal Law bribery offences require an element of corrupt intent. As such, demonstrating a lack of corrupt intent may operate as a defence. There are also minimum financial thresholds under the Criminal Law, below which criminal prosecution will not be brought.There is an affirmative defence under the Criminal Law for bribe payments made under threat of extortion, so long as the giver does not receive an illegitimate benefit.Agency enforcementWhat government agencies enforce the domestic bribery laws and regulations?Several bodies are involved in investigating bribery and corruption in China, including:the National Supervision Commission (NSC);the Ministry of Public Security and various local level public security bureaus;the Supreme People\u2019s Procuratorate and various local level people\u2019s procuratorates; andthe State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) and its local level offices.Offences under the Criminal Law are typically investigated and enforced by the Ministry of Public Security and various local level public security bureaus. NSC (established in March 2018) and various local level supervision commissions carry out investigations of suspected bribery by state personnel, but it is likely that other individuals and entities (eg, SOEs and multinational corporations (MNCs)) will get caught up in investigations initiated by the NSC (or local level supervision commissions).Offences under the Anti-unfair Competition Law are investigated and enforced by the SAMR.Patterns in enforcementDescribe any recent shifts in the patterns of enforcement of the domestic bribery rules.The enforcement environment in China is unpredictable and numerous authorities have jurisdiction to investigate alleged bribery and corruption. The 2018 amendments to the Anti-unfair Competition Law confer enhanced enforcement powers on administrative authorities and increases civil and administrative penalties for unfair competition and civil bribery.The pharmaceutical sector remains under considerable scrutiny by regulators and authorities, with several investigations underway. Of particular note is the announcement by China\u2019s Ministry of Finance in June 2019 that 77 major pharmaceutical companies would undergo an audit over a two-month period, including the local branches of multinational corporations Sanofi, Eli Lilly & Co and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. This announcement followed a filing by Kangmei Pharmaceutical Co that its 2017 results contained multiple \u2018accounting errors\u2019, which raised potential issues of corruption and bribery. The audit and subsequent audits have led to fines or criminal prosecution (or both) against multiple pharmaceutical companies for tax violations.Since 2020, China has been further strengthening efforts in investigating and combating bribery and corruption issues in connection with sales and purchase of drugs and medical devices, including kickbacks, illegal marketing/promotion, bribes under the cover of conferences or research cooperation, illegal donation and sponsorship, and unreasonable pricing of medicines and high-value medical consumables.There have also been several significant corruption investigations announced in the technology sector in recent years, including suspected corruption by individual employees of Meituan Dianping, the head of the video platform Youku, and senior employees from Baidu, Xiaomi, DiDi and ByteDance, etc.Prosecution of foreign companiesIn what circumstances can foreign companies be prosecuted for domestic bribery?Corporate criminal liability generally attaches where the relevant bribery misconduct is an exercise of \u2018corporate will\u2019 (ie, the decision to engage in the misconduct was a group decision or was made by the relevant personnel in charge). The authorities may also consider whether the corporate entity provided an advantage or received an illegitimate benefit when assessing corporate liability.In general, the Criminal Law applies when either the act or the consequence of a crime occurs within China. The Criminal Law applies to companies organised under Chinese law, including joint ventures, representative offices of non-Chinese enterprises and wholly foreign-owned enterprises.SanctionsWhat are the sanctions for individuals and companies that violate the domestic bribery rules?IndividualsIndividual offenders found guilty of bribing state personnel will be sentenced in accordance with the severity of the offence and whether any losses are caused to the interests of the state. For situations where especially heavy losses affect the interests of the state, and where circumstances of the offence are especially serious, the sentence will range between 10 years and life imprisonment, in addition to a concurrent fine or confiscation of property. The April 2016 judicial interpretation provides that fines should range from 100,000 yuan to twice the amount of the bribe.For criminal bribery offences committed in the private sector, individual offenders face up to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine ranging from 100,000 yuan to twice the amount of the bribe.CompaniesCorporate entities found guilty of bribing state personnel face fines ranging from 100,000 yuan to twice the amount of the bribe. Personnel in charge of the corporate entity and other personnel responsible for the crime may be imprisoned for up to five years. Under the current Criminal Law, recipients of bribes in the private sector may be imprisoned for at least five years and have their property confiscated. Following amendments to the Criminal Law, which became effective on 1 March 2021, in most serious circumstances, recipients of bribes in the private sector may receive life imprisonment and a criminal fine.As regards civil bribery offences under the Anti-unfair Competition Law, penalties include the confiscation of illegal gains and administrative fines of between 100,000 and 3 million yuan per violation, as well as the revocation of business licences in serious cases.Recent decisions and investigationsIdentify and summarise recent landmark decisions and investigations involving domestic bribery laws, including any investigations or decisions involving foreign companies.The highest-profile corporate investigation and decision involving foreign companies to date in China is that of UK pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in 2014. In that case, the local subsidiary of GSK was alleged to have bribed government officials, hospitals and doctors to sell more of its drugs at higher prices. Chinese authorities charged both the company and senior executives of its Chinese branch with bribery offences. The trial of the matter lasted one day and resulted in convictions for the company and the senior executives. GSK was penalised with a fine of US$492 million.There has also been significant enforcement activity in the financial sector, reflecting President Xi Jinping\u2019s announcement that the government will focus on eliminating corruption in this sector.",

            "description": "NewsBy Ron EmlerForeign investors may soon be able to take stakes in a further two of China\u2019s baijiu producers, reports Ron Emler.Bloomberg has stated that Guizhou Guotai Liquor Group is gearing up to list its shares on the Hong Kong stock market in an initial public offering that could raise more than $500 million.Zhen Jiu, a rival baijiu brand, is also considering raising as much as $400 million through a Hong Kong listing.Both are at an early stage in the process and the details could change.Alcohol producers are now banned from IPOs on China\u2019s domestic stock exchanges as the country reforms its listing system, depriving them of potentially higher valuations onshore. They are, however, able to float shares in Hong Kong, despite the former colony having reverted to Beijing\u2019s control in 1997.Guotai filed for a possible IPO in Shanghai in 2020, according to a preliminary document, while the two biggest baijiu producers, Kweichow Moutai Co. and Wuliangye Yibin, were listed on the Shanghai market before the regulations were changed.In the first 10 days of this year, global investors sunk almost US$2 billion into baijiu group Wulianye Yibin and only a marginally smaller amount into Kweichow Moutai, whose shares have put on nearly 6% since 1st January.Their shares can also be bought via Hong Kong, where they have soared over the past few years as investors seek to cash in on the high margins available in the Chinese market.Guotai, founded in 1999, sells high-end baijiu for as much as 2,999 yuan ($442) a bottle, according to its website. In 2021, its sales (including tax) exceeded 10 billion yuan.The news follows on from In the first 10 days of this year, global investors sank almost US$2 billion intoEarlier this month, the drinks business reported that a domestic surplus of baijiu, built up during the pandemic, could force prices down as retailers and produces move to shift stock. Some say that the baijiu industry has unopened stock worth more than US$40 billion, equivalent to half the total retail sales of baijiu in 2021.Locally-produced baijius take 95% of the national beverage alcohol market,",

Par son gigantisme, tout d\u2019abord, puisque l\u2019exploitation mesure 2.121 hectares, soit environ 3.000 terrains de football. Mais aussi par son montage financier : les 10,3 millions d'euros pay\u00e9s par l\u2019acheteur, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Agro Team, ne concernent en effet que la holding d\u2019exploitation, qui elle-m\u00eame coiffe une douzaine de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u00e9di\u00e9es \u00e0 la culture, au stockage des c\u00e9r\u00e9ales, \u00e0 la production d'\u00e9nergie, au transport\u2026 Le foncier, lui, demeurera dans le giron de la famille. Un moyen pour Bruno Broquerault, qui a patiemment construit cet ensemble en partant d\u2019une petite ferme, mais dont aucune des cinq filles ne souhaitait reprendre l\u2019exploitation, de percevoir des revenus pour sa retraite.Publicit\u00e9Publicit\u00e9Comme dans le cas de cette famille, l'image d'Epinal du paysan patriarche, r\u00e9gnant sur ses terres comme sur son clan, a v\u00e9cu. Les divorces, les choix de vie des enfants, les faillites, sont venus bouleverser le sch\u00e9ma ancestral d\u2019un domaine transmis de p\u00e8re en fils. En 2021, 720.000 hectares ont ainsi chang\u00e9 de mains dans le cadre d'une revente de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s (de type SA, SARL\u2026). Pour la plupart, ces parts sociales d'exploitations agricoles tombent dans l\u2019escarcelle d'investisseurs, qui, s\u2019ils ne manient ni binette ni brouette, savent en revanche lire un compte de r\u00e9sultat.\u00c0 LIRE AUSSIAgriculture : face au r\u00e9chauffement climatique, l\u2019obligation d\u2019innoverBien \u00e9videmment, ces financiers parient sur une rentabilit\u00e9 record. Mais pour quelle alimentation propos\u00e9e ? Le d\u00e9bat fait rage depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es. Les \u00e9cologistes, notamment Greenpeace, s'insurgent contre la production standardis\u00e9e de ces \u00ab fermes usines \u00bb et ces \u00e9levages \u00e0 grande \u00e9chelle de poulets, porcs, ou bovins. Selon Suzanne Dalle, charg\u00e9e de campagne au sein de l'ONG, \u00ab ce syst\u00e8me de production pr\u00e9sente des risques pour la sant\u00e9 \u00bb, avec le d\u00e9veloppement de bact\u00e9ries r\u00e9sistantes aux antibiotiques, ainsi que de zoonoses, c'est-\u00e0-dire de virus transmissibles \u00e0 l'\u00eatre humain.Publicit\u00e9En Bretagne, dans les Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es comme en Ile-de-France, les militants d\u00e9noncent aussi les d\u00e9g\u00e2ts caus\u00e9s \u00e0 l'eau, \u00e0 l'air \u2013 en raison des \u00e9missions d'ammoniac \u2013, et au climat, du fait du rejet de gaz \u00e0 effet de serre. Par ailleurs, ces fermes g\u00e9antes ne misent gu\u00e8re sur les aliments les plus en vogue. On y cherchera en vain du quinoa, de la lentille corail ou des carottes violettes. Circuits courts et vente directe? Non merci: leurs produits filent \u00e0 l'export, en restauration collective ou dans les rayons des hypermarch\u00e9s.\u00c0 LIRE AUSSINeoFarm veut d\u00e9velopper des microfermes \u00e9colos et cl\u00e9s en mainLes cultivateurs 3.0 ont les moyens d\u2019utiliser des technologies de pointeLe sociologue Fran\u00e7ois Purseigle, coauteur de l\u2019ouvrage \u00ab Une agriculture sans agriculteurs \u00bb avec Bertrand Hervieu (Ed. Presses de Sciences Po), nuance toutefois ce sombre tableau. \u00ab Les pand\u00e9mies et la pollution n'ont pas attendu les grandes exploitations pour se d\u00e9velopper. Les exigences en mati\u00e8re environnementale poussent d\u2019ailleurs \u00e0 la mise en place de grandes structures \u00bb, souligne-t-il. Et comme l\u2019indique avec malice Etienne Gangneron, vice-pr\u00e9sident du syndicat agricole FNSEA, \u00ab certaines fermes bio s'\u00e9tendent sur 300 hectares, tandis que des \u00e9levages labellis\u00e9s d\u00e9passent le millier de volailles. Peu importe la surface, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 : la qualit\u00e9 de la production d\u00e9pend du savoir-faire de l'agriculteur. \u00bbPublicit\u00e9Publicit\u00e9Cette mutualisation des moyens financiers offre d\u2019autres avantages, comme la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019utiliser des technologies de pointe, indispensables \u00e0 une agriculture de pr\u00e9cision. Gr\u00e2ce au flux de capitaux, ces cultivateurs 3.0 peuvent en effet investir dans des drones, qui survolent les champs pour cartographier les besoins en pesticides. Tandis que les \u00e9leveurs s'aident de capteurs install\u00e9s dans les poulaillers, qui alertent sur la sant\u00e9 et le niveau de stress des animaux. Les donn\u00e9es transmises sur smartphone via des applis permettent d'ajuster les doses d'antibiotiques, de nourriture, et la temp\u00e9rature ambiante.\u00c0 LIRE AUSSIFuture Ga\u00efa et sa ferme verticale, le potager le plus high-tech du mondeMais il n\u2019y a pas que le contenu de nos assiettes que ces fermes XXL risquent de chambouler. C'est bien connu : les gros poissons mangent les petits, et les \u00e9quilibres patrimoniaux de nos campagnes pourraient d\u00e8s lors p\u00e2tir de cette logique d\u2019\u00e9conomies d\u2019\u00e9chelle. Aujourd'hui, 80.000 fermes de plus de 100 hectares mobilisent d\u00e9j\u00e0 40% de la surface agricole de l'Hexagone. Fortes d'un potentiel de production de 250000 euros par an, elles repr\u00e9sentent d\u00e9sormais 1 exploitation agricole sur 5. Alors que leur nombre a augment\u00e9 de 3,4% ces dix derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, celui des micro-exploitations (moins de 25000 euros annuels) a fondu de 31%.Publicit\u00e9Inquiet de cette concentration, le syndicat Jeunes Agriculteurs (JA) lan\u00e7ait d\u00e8s 2017 un slogan : \u00ab Des fermes, pas des firmes! \u00bb M\u00eames critiques au sein de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration paysanne ou de l'association Terre de liens, pourtant situ\u00e9es \u00e0 l'oppos\u00e9 de l'\u00e9chiquier politique. Les deux organismes s'opposent \u00e0 tout \u00ab accaparement des terres \u00bb, consid\u00e9rant que de nouveaux paysans ne pourront plus investir dans ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, devenues trop on\u00e9reuses.\u00c0 LIRE AUSSIAvec sa plateforme, Agriconomie veut r\u00e9volutionner le secteur agricoleIl faut dire qu\u2019en 2021 le prix des pr\u00e9s a augment\u00e9 de 6% dans l'Allier, le Doubs et en Haute-Savoie, avec des pics \u00e0 10% en Beauce, et m\u00eame 19% dans le Haut-Jura. \u00ab Sur la totalit\u00e9 des surfaces agricoles vendues, 70% partent \u00e0 l'agrandissement \u00bb, d\u00e9plore ainsi Tanguy Martin, charg\u00e9 de plaidoyer au sein de Terre de liens. Une association qui, pour contrer la sp\u00e9culation fonci\u00e8re, mobilise dons et \u00e9pargne solidaire afin d\u2019acheter des fermes, pour ensuite les louer sur tr\u00e8s longue dur\u00e9e \u00e0 des agriculteurs bio. Depuis 2003, Terre de liens en a acquis 300, repr\u00e9sentant 7.000 hectares. Une paille dans une immense botte de foin. \u00ab On observe l'\u00e9mergence de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ayant leur si\u00e8ge social dans un village du Bassin parisien, mais faisant valoir des terres dans les Landes, le Cher ou l'Indre, voire m\u00eame au Maroc ou en Roumanie \u00bb, d\u00e9crypte Fran\u00e7ois Purseigle.Publicit\u00e9Publicit\u00e9Derri\u00e8re ces structures figurent souvent des hommes d'affaires aux poches profondes, qui y placent leurs capitaux comme ils le feraient dans une usine, une cha\u00eene de restaurant ou une start-up. \u00ab Ces investisseurs peuvent aussi \u00eatre des industriels de l'agroalimentaire ou de la grande distribution, cherchant \u00e0 s\u00e9curiser leur approvisionnement \u00bb, poursuit le sociologue. Evidemment, ces actionnaires en costume crois\u00e9 ne chaussent pas les bottes, et choisissent plut\u00f4t de d\u00e9l\u00e9guer la gestion \u00e0 un \u00ab land manager \u00bb, en charge des semences, de la r\u00e9colte\u2026 Une pratique d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9pandue en Grande-Bretagne et en Belgique, o\u00f9 des entreprises sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es dans le conseil agronomique pilotent de A \u00e0 Z plusieurs milliers d'hectares. \u00ab Le travail est souvent sous-trait\u00e9 \u00e0 des entreprises de travaux agricoles. Les propri\u00e9taires n'habitent pas sur place. On se retrouve avec des habitations quasi abandonn\u00e9es dans nos villages \u00bb, regrette Etienne Gangneron.\u00c0 LIRE AUSSITelaqua propose aux agriculteurs une solution d\u2019irrigation connect\u00e9eDepuis fin 2021, une loi impose des limites aux agrandissements excessifsPublicit\u00e9Et nul besoin de d\u00e9tenir un passeport tricolore pour s'offrir du bocage normand, des for\u00eats vosgiennes ou des prairies fleuries de Loz\u00e8re : rien n\u2019emp\u00eache N\u00e9erlandais, Britanniques ou Allemands d\u2019emporter ces bonnes affaires. Comme en 2016, lors du rachat de 2.600 hectares dans l'Allier et l'Indre par un investisseur chinois. Et m\u00eame si, depuis, l\u2019investisseur en cause, le groupe Reward, a fait faillite, l'affaire est rest\u00e9e en m\u00e9moire, et a inspir\u00e9 un Etat soucieux de pr\u00e9server la souverainet\u00e9 alimentaire. Pour \u00e9viter de nouveaux d\u00e9rapages, le gouvernement a ainsi fait voter, en d\u00e9cembre 2021, la loi dite Sempastous, qui impose des limites aux agrandissements excessifs. Le dispositif s'appuie d\u2019ailleurs sur une de nos vieilles sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9s : les Safer (soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d'am\u00e9nagement foncier et d'\u00e9tablissement rural), plac\u00e9es sous tutelle du minist\u00e8re de l'Agriculture.R\u00e9parties sur tout le territoire, ces structures sans but lucratif disposaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u2019un droit de pr\u00e9emption sur les terres, en cas de contestation sur le prix, mais aussi pour prot\u00e9ger l'environnement, ou pour installer un jeune agriculteur. La nouvelle loi en renforce les pr\u00e9rogatives: elles peuvent \u2013 enfin \u2013 contr\u00f4ler les cessions de parts de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, afin de garantir la transparence des op\u00e9rations. \u00ab S'il faut enqu\u00eater pour conna\u00eetre la nationalit\u00e9 des holdings, nous le faisons \u00bb, assure par exemple Philippe Tuzelet, directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Safer Nouvelle-Aquitaine, qui s\u2019est charg\u00e9e du dossier Broquerault.Publicit\u00e9Publicit\u00e9Autre innovation : ces Safer sont en droit d'imposer des mesures compensatoires. C\u2019est ainsi que le domaine de Ciss\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 amput\u00e9 de 70 hectares, destin\u00e9s \u00e0 d'autres exploitants. \u00ab C'est bien la preuve que l'esprit de cette r\u00e9forme est vertueux. Notre intervention a permis de conserver les emplois sur place, et de favoriser l'installation de nouveaux agriculteurs \u00bb, souligne Philippe Tuzelet. Cependant, pour la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration paysanne de la Vienne, une telle compensation reste mince par rapport \u00e0 la surface totale de 2.121 hectares.Tout juste vot\u00e9e, d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9cri\u00e9e, la loi Sempastous ne pouvait de toute fa\u00e7on que m\u00e9nager la ch\u00e8vre et le chou : il s\u2019agit en effet de contrer la sp\u00e9culation fonci\u00e8re, sans pour autant bloquer les transmissions. Ni entraver la reprise des exploitations, alors que la population d\u2019agriculteurs vieillit. Les r\u00e9sultats du dernier recensement sont en effet implacables : d'ici 2026, pr\u00e8s de 1 paysan sur 2 aura atteint l'\u00e2ge de la retraite, et il manque d\u00e9j\u00e0 7.000 repreneurs par an pour assurer le renouvellement des g\u00e9n\u00e9rations.Publicit\u00e9Faut-il privil\u00e9gier l'installation de la rel\u00e8ve sur des surfaces modestes ? Ou favoriser la concentration des terres, g\u00e9r\u00e9es en holdings ? Charge au ministre de l\u2019Agriculture, Marc Fesneau, de r\u00e9soudre cet urgent dilemme. Il pr\u00e9pare d\u2019ailleurs pour juin prochain une loi d'orientation et d'avenir sur la transmission du foncier. Depuis d\u00e9but 2022, tout citoyen peut aussi se prononcer en ligne sur la transition \u00e9cologique, la formation, ou encore l'installation des jeunes. Et sans doute, en d\u00e9finitive, sur ce qu\u2019il trouvera dans son assiette\u2026Les plus beaux vignobles subissent aussi la spe\u0301culation financie\u0300reC'est bien connu : les vignobles enivrent les fonds financiers comme les grandes fortunes, et la sp\u00e9culation sur ce type de foncier d\u00e9passe celle sur les terres agricoles ou les for\u00eats. Exemple en octobre dernier, o\u00f9 le groupe Art\u00e9mis Domaines, majoritairement d\u00e9tenu par la famille Pinault, a mis la main sur une p\u00e9pite : la maison bourguignonne Bouchard P\u00e8re et Fils, propri\u00e9taire de la Vigne de l'enfant J\u00e9sus, au c\u0153ur de l'appellation beaune premier cru les Gr\u00e8ves. Si le montant de la transaction reste secret, ce nouvel \u00e9pisode de la surench\u00e8re entre les milliardaires Pinault et Arnault confirme que la flamb\u00e9e des prix n\u2019est sans doute pas finie. Aujourd'hui, 1 hectare de bourgogne grand cru co\u00fbte 16,5 millions d'euros, selon le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Agriculture.Publicit\u00e9Publicit\u00e9\u00c0 LIRE AUSSIRos\u00e9 de Provence : LVMH \u201cchasse comme un fou\u201d\u00ab La sp\u00e9culation li\u00e9e aux investisseurs fran\u00e7ais ou \u00e9trangers complique les transmissions et les successions des vignerons locaux, d\u00e9nonce Thi\u00e9bault Huber, pr\u00e9sident de la CAVB (Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des appellations et des vignerons de Bourgogne). Nous avons demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Bercy de dissocier les cessions dans le cadre d'une famille de viticulteurs des transactions pures. \u00bb Il n\u2019y aura peut-\u00eatre pas besoin de telles dispositions dans le Bordelais: apr\u00e8s avoir investi dans des centaines de domaines, les affairistes chinois ferment en effet boutique. \u00ab Au moins une cinquantaine de vignobles sont \u00e0 vendre, confirme Li Lijuan, sp\u00e9cialiste au sein du cabinet Vineyards-Bordeaux. P\u00e9kin interdit de sortir des capitaux, et les propri\u00e9taires du pays ne peuvent plus renflouer. \u00bb Au printemps dernier, le g\u00e9ant des spiritueux Kweichow Moutai a d\u00fb c\u00e9der Ch\u00e2teau Loudenne dans le M\u00e9doc \u00e0 la famille Gouache.

            "description": "While investors widely expected China to exit from its zero-COVID-19 policies to revive economic growth, many were caught off guard by the pace of relaxation. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index \u2014 a gauge of US-listed China stocks \u2014 and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng China Enterprises Index both recovered roughly half of the losses in the previous 10 months in November and December. Big names from liquor maker Kweichow Moutai to e-commerce giant Tencent Holdings extended climbs into 2023.Big names from liquor maker Kweichow Moutai to e-commerce giant Tencent Holdings extended climbs into 2023. GettyThe percentage of Asia-Pacific-focused hedge funds that made money in 2022 more than doubled in the last two months to nearly a third, according to data from Preqin. And while more than a third of Asian funds were at least 30 per cent in the red in the first 10 months, that figure shrank to just under 7 per cent at year-end.Brilliance China Core Long Short Fund jumped 22 per cent in the final two months of the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, cutting its annual loss to 22 per cent. It lost a similar amount in 2021, when founder Shi Lin apologised to investors for failing to quickly grasp the impact of Beijing\u2019s reform of the after-school tutoring market. Assets of the vehicle tumbled to $US86 million, one-eighth of the February 2021 peak.Pinpoint\u2019s China Fund trimmed its 2022 loss to about 13 per cent, after a 5.1 per cent November rebound, said Wong.The recovery has gathered steam this year, with the Golden Dragon index surging 13 per cent. E-commerce giant Alibaba Group has jumped 29 per cent in US trading.AdvertisementDantai Capital\u2019s Greater China stock hedge fund had a positive December but still finished the year down 46 per cent, said a person familiar with the matter. In April, it offered to halve management fees for investors after suffering a 27 per cent first-quarter decline.Some funds missed out on the rally. CloudAlpha Capital Management\u2019s hedge fund had a moderate gain in November but lost money in December to end the year down 37 per cent, said two people with knowledge of the matter. It focuses on hard technology companies in the US and China and has limited exposure to the nation\u2019s consumer-related stocks, which led the initial rally.The following managers were among the year\u2019s top gainers.Representatives from the funds mentioned in this article, except Pinpoint, declined to comment or didn\u2019t reply to requests for comment.Ariose Capital Management, which oversees $US747 million and maintained a bearish tilt toward Chinese stocks for much of the year, held on to most of its earlier gains to finish the year up 49 per cent even after losses in the final two months, according to a newsletter.Alpine Investment Management\u2019s China stock hedge fund, run by former Goldman Sachs trader Tony Song, saw a 37 per cent return, a person with knowledge of the matter said. About a quarter of the gains before fees came from macro hedges against surprises such as those in the currency, rates and commodity markets, the person added. Having opened in the latter part of 2021, the fund quickly gathered about $US1 billion of assets.AdvertisementFormer Marshall Wace portfolio manager Ramesh Karthigesu\u2019s Kaizen Asia Pacific Master Fund surged at least 26 per cent for the year, said two people with knowledge of the matter.The China stock hedge fund of Triata Capital returned 50 per cent in November and another 11 per cent in December, swinging back from losses to a nearly 23 per cent gain by year end. The December profits were driven by bullish bets on internet companies and New Oriental Education & Technology Group, one of the stocks earlier hammered during China\u2019s crackdown on after-school tutoring companies. Bearish wagers on electric vehicle, leisure and electrical equipment stocks also paid off, chief investment officer Sean Ho wrote in a newsletter.The latest distressed asset fund of Alp Ercil\u2019s $US3.5 billion Asia Research & Capital Management returned nearly 23 per cent in 2022, said a person with knowledge of the matter. The fund profited in the first quarter from investments equities of in traditional energy and resources producers that stood to benefit from demand from the global move to lower carbon emissions and a decade of cost-cutting and consolidation. The fund later slashed equity holdings and made gains from bargain hunting long-dated investment-grade debt of similar companies as UK pensions dumped liquid assets in late September to cover losses.She Peng led Golden Pine Asset Management\u2019s China stock hedge fund to a 20 per cent advance, said two people with knowledge of the number. It was the seventh consecutive positive year since its 2016 inception, one of them added. The fund made money from energy and upstream materials stocks that benefited from an inflationary environment and long-term industry supply constraints. Contrarian investments in consumer discretionary stocks, such as a turnaround for education companies, also proved lucrative.Nine Masts Capital\u2018s hedge fund rose almost 15 per cet in 2022, with assets approaching the pre-COVID-19 level of $US1.1 billion, said a person with knowledge of the matter. It made money arbitraging Asian companies\u2019 bonds and shares listed in different markets, with more than half of the returns involving Chinese companies.Bloomberg",

            "description": "(Yicai Global) Jan. 16 -- China\u2019s ZJLD Group has filed for an initial public offering in Hong Kong, hoping to become the first baijiu maker to list there in seven years as competition escalates between makers of the popular liquor made from fermented sorghum.Proceeds of the IPO will be mainly used for capacity expansion, brand building, and marketing over the next five years, ZJLD said in its Jan. 13 filing, noting that some of the money will go to upgrade digitalization and supplement operating funds. The firm did not disclose the size of the IPO, but an online media report said it could raise USD300 million to USD400 million.Other Chinese baijiu producers, such as Sichuan Langjiu and Guizhou Guotai Liquor Group, also applied for listings in recent years, seeking to fund production expansions amid growing competition in the industry. Wu Xiangdong, ZJLD\u2019s founder and chairman, had planned to take the Hong Kong-based distiller public since 2021.ZJLD is China\u2019s fourth-biggest private baijiu company by revenue, according to its IPO prospectus. Revenue jumped 18 percent to CNY4.25 billion (USD632 billion) in the nine months ended Sept. 30, while net profit fell 8.8 percent to CNY712 million (USD106 million).The company owns the Zhenjiu, Lidu, and Xiangjiao brands, with most of its revenue coming from Zhenjiu, a soy sauce aroma type of the spirit. ZJLD is the fifth maker of soy sauce aroma baijiu to file for an IPO since 2020.The Matthew effect -- whereby advantaged market players accrue even more advantage over time -- is becoming increasingly evident in the baijiu industry as it comes ever more under the sway of leading players and famous brands, analyst Cai Xuefei told Yicai Global. Producers will compete on production capacity, brand, culture, and channels in the future, he added, noting that going public is a means of obtaining funds to compete better.Zhenjiu Holding, a firm owned by Wu, is ZJLD\u2019s biggest shareholder with an 81.3 percent stake, followed by Kohlberg Kravis Roverts-backed Zest Holdings with 16.2 percent and ChinaNet with 2.5 percent, according to the filing. ChinaNet is controlled by ZJLD Executive Director Wu Guangshu.ZJLD, which has distilleries in Guizhou, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces, is renovating and installing new production equipment to speed up capacity expansion. The firm is expected to increase its annual capacity by 26,000 tons of liquor by 2024. Some 16,600 tons will be of soy sauce aroma baijiu.By 2026, soy sauce aroma baijiu will account for almost 42 percent of China\u2019s baijiu market, the most of any baijiu variety, ZJLD said, citing a report from US consultancy firm Frost & Sullivan. So ZJLD needs to expand output quickly to fortify its market-leading position and boost profits, it said.Leading soy sauce aroma baijiu producers, including industry giant Kweichow Moutai, have been accelerating capacity expansion of this kind of baijiu in the past two years to seize a bigger market share.Goldman Sachs and China Securities International are the IPO\u2019s sponsors.Editors: Shi Yi, Futura Costaglione",

To see more such companies, go to 5 Biggest Non-Tech Companies in the World by Market Cap.Easy monetary policies, tech revolution, disposable income and societal changes after the coronavirus pandemic injected a euphoria-like optimism in the technology industry, causing a dramatic rise in tech stock valuations. During the summer of 2020, six major tech companies \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and Tesla \u2014 accounted for about half of the total value of the NASDAQ 100 index. Trends like work-from-home, internet streaming, online gaming, media and entertainment fueled the growth of tech companies. However, all this optimism around tech and growth stocks came crashing down in 2022 as inflation started to go through the roof and the Federal Reserve decided to begin belt tightening. Major tech companies that were betting big on future technologies like metaverse, AI, machine learning and robotics failed to woo investors and saw billions of dollars erased from their market value as investors flocked to value plays. Major growth investors like Cathie Wood suffered huge losses that are expected to continue this year.Technology companies have now started to lay off employees and cut costs as warning calls for a recession in 2023 grow. According to a layoffs tracking website, there were about 150,000 jobs cuts in the tech industry in 2022. That\u2019s despite the fact that the labor market remained strong in the year. Tech companies are expected to increase the number of layoffs as these firms run out of safety nets. Meta Platforms announced over 11,000 layoffs in November. In the same month, Amazon, which has a reputation of being a major tech recruiter, began its biggest layoff initiative in its 28-year history. This layoff plan is expected to affect about 10,000 employees.Tech companies are expected to remain under pressure until the economy comes back to its normal trajectory.Story continuesPixabay/Public Domain Our MethodologyAs investors look beyond tech stocks and try to find old-school, non-tech companies operating in a diverse range of sectors, we decided to give our readers a basic rundown of some of the biggest non-tech companies in the world. For this article we used stock screeners and manual search to list down the biggest companies in the world outside of the technology industry. After that we picked the top 15 companies from this selection based on market cap. These 15 companies are ranked according to their market cap. As expected, almost all of these companies are quite famous. We mentioned brief intros of these companies along with their latest performance and interesting news around these firms.All market caps are as of January 4.Biggest Non-Tech Companies in the World by Market Cap15.

            "description": "Andiamo in Cina perch\u00e9 qui il principale produttore di birra cinese, China Resources Holdings, ha deciso di buttarsi nel mercato del baiju, una sorta di acquavite cinese. E tutto perch\u00e9, a quanto pare, le vendite di birra erano in calo (ma non era la Cina il paese in cui se ne beveva di pi\u00f9?).La birra vende poco? In Cina ci si d\u00e0 all\u2019acquaviteA quanto pare, le vendite di birra sul mercato interno cinese stanno diminuendo. Per questo motivo, per correre ai ripari, China Resources Holdings, il principale produttore di birra del paese ha deciso di provare a capitalizzare l\u2019aumentata domanda di baiju.Gi\u00e0 a ottobre 2022 la societ\u00e0, nota per il marchio di birra Snow, aveva annunciato che una delle sue unit\u00e0 aveva accettato di acquisire una partecipazione del 55,19% nel produttore cinese di baiju Guizhou Jinsha Jiaojiu Winery in modo da rafforzare la sua presenza in settori diversi da quello della birra.L\u2019acquisto di questa quota \u00e8 stato stimato di 12,3 miliardi di yuan, pari a circa 1,49 miliardi di sterline. Secondo Nikkei Asia, China Resources Holdings sta cercando di diversificare il proprio portfolio, espandendosi al di l\u00e0 del mercato della birra.L\u2019azienda vinicola Jinsha Jiaojiu ha registrato un fatturato di 2 miliardi di yuan nel corso della prima met\u00e0 del 2022, con un aumento del 15% rispetto all\u2019anno precedente. La cantina ha poi anche registrato un utile netto di 670 milioni di yuan, con un aumento del 12%, secondo un report pubblicato da CR Beer.Il fatto \u00e8 che in Cina c\u2019\u00e8 stato un notevole aumento della domanda di baiju. Anzi: si prevede che il 2023 il baiju potrebbe essere uno dei protagonisti del palcoscenico internazionale. Anche la cinese Kweichow Moutai, il pi\u00f9 grande produttore mondiale di bevande alcoliche, ha deciso di investire qualcosa come 2,23 miliardi di dollari in nuovi impianti di produzione, in modo da soddisfare la crescente domanda di acquavite cinese.L\u2019idea di Kweichow Moutai \u00e8 quella di costruire 68 nuove distillerie, 69 depositi di stoccaggio e e ulteriori infrastrutture di produzione nel corso dei prossimi quattro anni. Le nuove strutture produttive aumenteranno la capacit\u00e0 produttiva a 19.800 tonnellate di baiju (ricordiamo che il baiju \u00e8 un liquore cinese a base di sorgo fermentato o riso).Sembra che le vendite del colosso cinese dei liquori abbiano ricevuto un\u2019ulteriore spinta grazie all\u2019apertura del primo negozio CostCo in Cina. Lo scorso settembre, infatti, dopo l\u2019inaugurazione la gente si \u00e8 riversata in massa per fare incetta di articoli scontati, fra cui anche prodotti Kweichow: da CostCo venivano venduti a 1.498 yuan, rispetto al prezzo di mercato di pi\u00f9 di 2.500 yuan. Anzi: le vendite sono andate cos\u00ec bene che il negozio \u00e8 stato costretto a rifornirsi di ulteriori 10mila bottiglie di liquore in quanto le scorte iniziali si sono esaurite rapidamente."

Im Ranking der 100 wertvollsten Unternehmen der Welt ist Deutschland NICHT mehr vertreten, so das Ergebnis einer Studie der Beratungsgesellschaft EY.Ende 2021 kamen mit SAP und Siemens noch zwei der 100 wertvollsten Unternehmen der Welt aus Deutschland, 2007 waren es noch sieben. Ein Abw\u00e4rtstrend, der f\u00fcr ganz Europa gilt: Ende 2007, vor dem H\u00f6hepunkt der Finanzkrise, kamen laut EY noch 46 der 100 wertvollsten Unternehmen der Welt aus Europa, aktuell sind es nur noch 15. Zum Vergleich: Aus Asien kommen 19 der gr\u00f6\u00dften B\u00f6rsenunternehmen, angef\u00fchrt vom Techkonzern Tencent.Unter den Top zehn ist laut EY gar kein Unternehmen mehr aus Europa.

The new auction record for fine wine and spirits excludes private sales and retail sales in this category.Fine wine came out on top as the primary revenue source, racking up US$121 million in 2022. Spirits sales continue to climb, up 15% year on year to $29 million, highlighting a growing interest in collectable fine whiskies and spirits.In September, bidding for The Macallan The Reach 81 Years Old single malt, a one-of-a-kind special edition and the oldest whisky ever to come to auction, opened at Sotheby\u2019s in London. It sold for \u00a3300,000 (US$325,740).Sales of spirits more than doubled in the US from $5 million to $12 million, driven by stronger demand for luxury bottlings.Sotheby\u2019s hosted a milestone 750-lot auction it claimed was the world\u2019s most valuable American whiskey auction in history, featuring two of the most significant collections ever to come to market.Sotheby\u2019s is set to continue its expansion in Asia in 2023. The region remains on top of sales for the auction house, realising more than a third of total auction sales in 2022, amounting to US$54 million. Sotheby\u2019s also reported that buyers from Asia made up 41% of sales by value this year.The British-founded multinational hosted its first dedicated Moutai auction in May this year. The sale, named \u2018Vintage Moutai | Spirit of China\u2019 offered 12 lots with a combined estimated value in the region of \u00a3300,000.The demand for Moutai has been on the rise globally in recent years.

            "description": "NewsBy Douglas BlydeFormerly of Veuve Clicquot, the eminent cellarmaster joined Lallier in January 2021 following its acquisition by Campari Group. He shares his fascination for native yeasts, low dosage wines, and love for fly fishing with Douglas Blyde\u2026What is the Lallier style?Each house has its own philosophy from which its style arises. When I first had the opportunity to taste Lallier\u2019s range two years ago, what impressed me was the balance its wines achieve between the four pillars of \u201cpurity\u201d from chalk, \u201cfreshness\u201d from our cool climate, and the \u201cintensity\u201d and \u201cdepth\u201d derived from the grapes to the blending, and also from ageing. Our Series \u201cR\u201d and flagship \u201cOuvrage\u201d capture these \u201cemotions\u201d. R, for Reflexion shows a touch of the year across 50 villages as well as older wines, while Ouvrage encapsulates two Grand Cru parcels: Oger on the C\u00f4te des Blancs and A\u00ff on the Montagne de Reims.What special work with yeasts have you been undertaking at Lallier?At the end of the twentieth century we were left with three main varieties of yeast in Champagne which have done a wonderful job at stabilising fermentation and bringing consistency of flavour. However, a few years ago, Lallier\u2019s general manager, Frances Tribaut begun work on selecting yeasts found naturally within specific parcels which he would then apply to fermentations from those sites. I have continued his work this year, selecting yeasts from our vineyards in Loridon and Cuis and it has been very interesting to see what happened. This form of \u201cparcellaire\u201d winemaking provides me with a diversity of wines showing intensity, and a deeper touch when assembling a blend. It is also very important for us to keep our wines on their lees whether in tanks or in barrels. Even when the yeasts from fermentation have died, they still give to the wine, particularly texturally.What other ways have you pleasantly disrupted Champagne?Each year I start from a blank page depending on what nature brings. Terroir is fascinating. When you have a cru which is mostly known for Pinot Noir, as in our home of A\u00ff, yet you have a beautiful vineyard of Chardonnay, it can be very exciting to discover what the Chardonnay can bring you. Also, I have been exploring sixty year old Pinot Meunier planted in Cuis in the C\u00f4te des Blancs where Chardonnay otherwise dominates. It is a question of curiosity.How would you describe your relationship with Francis Tribaut?Very good. Francis did a wonderful job from 2004 to 2020 to develop Lallier on the market and to communicate the roots of Lallier. We meet every two or three weeks when I invite him to taste my work. He brings a sense of continuity, quality and consistency. I also work closely with Frederic Olivier, Production Manager, who has been with Lallier for 28 years. We actually went to school together thirty years ago and it is nice to finally have the opportunity to finally work altogether.Why are you taking the decision to deploy oak barrels which have been coopered in the Champagne region?It is both a question of furthering a human relationship and wishing to source locally, including barrels made from Champagne\u2019s beautiful forests. We only have one cooperage in Champagne led by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Viard whom I\u2019ve known a long time though never had the opportunity to work with before. Last June, I had the chance to visit him at the Tonnellerie de Champagne. Using wood coming from very close to Lallier appeals in the same way as drawing yeasts from our vineyards, leading to increased precision in blending at the highest level.What proportion of vineyards which Lallier manages does it also own?Roughly 10% of our needs are met by our own Chardonnay-dominated vineyards, which are mostly very well situated in the C\u00f4te des Blancs, A\u00ff and in Verzenay in the Montagne de Reims.Is one of Lallier\u2019s missions to \u201cgo green\u201d, and what steps have been taken to realise this aim?Biodiversity is something I am sensitive to and it is crucial we ensure the transmission of beautiful vineyards to the next generation. We want to be greener in everything we are doing, especially in the vineyards, which are certified \u201cHVE\u201d (Haute Valeur Environnementale). We intend to phase out the use of herbicides entirely by 2024, while trialling organic production over several parcels. We have also invested in tractors to cultivate the soil. I work closely with Cyrille Diniz, Technical Director and Mathieu Pingret, Vineyard Manager. We are looking at the weight of our bottles and the amount of packaging. And in the winery we are assessing the carbon impact, including looking into solar power. On that note, last year we hired Camille Seite, Oenologist and QHSE Manager (Quality Health Safety and Environment) to support with producing a sustainability audit.Are you likely to release a z\u00e9ro-dosage wine?Low dosage is already part of Lallier\u2019s DNA. It could be interesting to have a zero dosage, though such an approach can lead to wines which can be too linear, green and sharp while lacking in texture. We must follow our consumers, most of whom like a delicate sweetness which is often what awakens their senses, while others are interested by zero dosage and it is important for a house like Lallier to consider allowing them the opportunity to enjoy such a Champagne when a perfect balance can be achieved..And a Coteaux Champenois?Our energy goes into effervescence though we have beautiful parcels, ageing under oak, which gives us the opportunity for a potential still wine. Though I do not believe such a wine would be intended for sale but for guests coming to Lallier to enjoy.Given Campari Group acquired the Maison in May 2020, is Lallier the first Italian-owned Champagne house?I believe it is first house in Champagne to see Italian investment. When we welcomed Luca Garavoglia, chairman of the Campari Group to Lallier, the discussion was always about quality \u2013 how to make great wine and how to enhance the perception of Lallier.If not guiding sapid Champagnes to fruition, what other job might you have done?In life much of what you do as a young person informs what you do later on, and I spent my teenage years studying in Burgundy, so why not make wine there? I love to produce things coming from the soil, so maybe also a farmer.Tell us something unusual about yourself?I love to be close to nature, water in particular, and I greatly enjoy fly fishing, getting clues from how insects behave around the surface, then catching a trout or a salmon before letting it go. The I am also enjoy spending any time I can with my wonderful family, including three children and our two golden retrievers, the younger of which comes fishing with me.What is your last word?I want to bring pleasure to people who drink Lallier. This is why I wake up every morning: to make sure when somebody opens a bottle it will bring them joy.Lallier is imported by Whisky Exchange and Amathus.champagne-lallier.com",

            "description": "Chloe Qu, senior manager research analyst, Morningstar ChinaThere can be few tougher jobs this year than being a portfolio manager for a Chinese growth fund. In addition to the investor rotation from growth stocks to value stocks witnessed globally, China\u2019s stock market has been battered by a series of macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds.Such has been the extent of the difficulties that investors have abandoned Chinese stocks in droves. According to the most recent data from MSCI, its China index is currently trading at a price-to-forward earnings ratio of 11.78x versus 21.43x for its Indian equivalent.However, there are signs that the tide is now beginning to turn. Last month, regulators unveiled a 16-point plan to rescue the country\u2019s beleaguered property sector. This included allowing developers\u2019 outstanding bank loans and trust borrowings due within the next six months to be extended for a year.Although some market observers have argued that the reforms did not go far enough, they at least represent the first serious regulatory intervention in the sector since property developer Evergrande Group defaulted on its offshore bonds more than a year ago.Equally, there have been signs of a thawing in relations between China and the US following the meeting between US President Joe Biden and China President Xi Jinping at the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia last month.Only last week, the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board said it had received the go-ahead to inspect the audit work of Chinese companies listed in the US, ending an impasse that threatened to see Alibaba Group Holding and others delisted from US stock exchanges.The biggest sea change however has been the relaxation of China\u2019s strict zero-Covid policy, which has led to a rally in Chinese stocks both on the mainland and in Hong Kong and a series of broker upgrades, notably from Morgan Stanley as the US investment bank upgraded its outlook on China to overweight this month for the first time in nearly two years.Against this backdrop, Chloe Qu, senior manager research analyst for Morningstar China, based in Shenzhen, selected the E Fund Kexiang fund and the Franklin Sealand China Prospect Fund A CNY fund for this week\u2019s head-to-head.E Fund Management Franklin Templeton Size Rmb6.6bn Rmb2.5bn Inception 2008 2007 Managers Hao Chen Li Rong Xu Three-year cumulative return n/a n/a Three-year annualised return 20.15% 19.86% Three-year annualised alpha 19.65 15.11 Three-year annualised volatility n/a n/a Three-year information ratio n/a n/a Morningstar star rating n/a n/a Morningstar analyst rating n/a n/a FE Crown fund rating n/a n/a OCF (retail share class) n/a n/a Source: Morningstar (21 December 2022)Investment approachBoth funds have quite different investor processes. The E Fund Kexiang fund begins with the portfolio manager identifying either high growth or long-term secular growth sectors based on macroeconomic and political factors.The portfolio manager, Hao Chen, then chooses which securities to invest in based on a number of factors including companies with rapid earnings growth and management teams with strong execution capabilities.Generally speaking, the fund has a bias towards smaller companies and it is also well-diversified with 70-100 names, while the top 10 holdings generally make up less than 45% of the portfolio.\u201cThat said, Chen is not afraid to take big sector bets and his portfolio can be concentrated in certain secular growth sectors, such as information technology,\u201d said Qu.Meanwhile, the investment process for the Franklin Sealand China Prospect fund is primarily bottom-up focused.\u201cThe portfolio looks consistent with Xu\u2019s process and tilts towards growth sectors. It also has higher ROE and ROIC than its benchmark CSI 300 index,\u201d Chloe Qu, senior manager research analyst, Morningstar ChinaAt the industry level, the portfolio manager, Li Rong Xu, seeks out industries with high and sustainable long-term growth potential and at the company level looks for companies that have financial strength and strong execution capabilities. Xu also looks to purchase stocks below their intrinsic value.Xu then constructs a portfolio of 30-40 names and caps the sector and stock exposures at 30% and 7% respectively. The top 10 holdings typically make up half of the fund\u2019s overall assets.\u201cThe portfolio looks consistent with Xu\u2019s process and tilts towards growth sectors. It also has higher ROE and ROIC than its benchmark CSI 300 index,\u201d said Qu.Fund characteristicsSector allocation:E Fund Management Franklin Templeton Basic materials 17.13% Basic materials 7.73% Consumer cyclical 5.29% Consumer cyclical 6.16% Real Estate 1.39% Financial services 18.42% Energy 0.03% Industrials 19.12% Industrials 18.79% Technology 25.85% Technology 21.17% Consumer defensive 10.88% Consumer Defensive 25.6% Healthcare 11.84% Healthcare 9% Utilities 1.6% Source: Morningstar, December 2022Top 5 holdings:E Fund Management Weighting Franklin Templeton Weighting Kweichow Moutai Co 9.06% Suzhou Maxwell Technologies Co 7.12% Tianqi Lithium Industries 8.03% Maxscend Microelectronics Co 5.98% Wuliangye Yibin Co 6.17% Beijing Oriental Yuhong Waterproof Technology Co 5.54% CTS International Logistics Corp 5.49% LONGi Green Energy Technology Co 5.53% Ninestar Corporation Class 5.47% East Money Information Co 5.47% Source: Morningstar, December 2022PerformanceBoth funds typically do well when growth stocks rally but lag when more defensive and value stocks are in vogue. As a result, both funds did well in 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2020 but have struggled in 2016, 2018 and 2022.Qu notes that both funds have held up well in this year\u2019s bear market, although the Franklin Sealand China Prospect fund tends to fare better given its more diversified sector allocation. It recorded a year-to-date return of -13.72% compared with -18.62% for the E Fund Kexiang fund.Unsurprisingly, the E Fund Kexiang fund is more volatile given its higher sector concentration and penchant for higher growth names.\u201cThat said, investors are well compensated by the additional risk taken. E Fund Kexiang performed well on the risk-adjusted basis over the same time spans.\u201d Chloe Qu, senior manager research analyst, Morningstar China\u201cWhile Chen has successfully navigated the difficult market environment in 2022 and E Fund Kexinag has held up relatively well, its volatility (as measured by standard deviation) was still higher than both FS China Prospect and the CSI 300 index over 3-year, 5-year and 10-year periods ending 30 November 2022,\u201d said Qu.\u201cThat said, investors are well compensated by the additional risk taken. E Fund Kexiang performed well on the risk-adjusted basis over the same time spans.\u201dIn terms of fees, China actively managed equity-heavy funds (those with more than 70% assets in equities in their normal running) do not see much fee differentiation. Both funds charge a management fee of 1.5% per annum and a custodian fee of 0.25%, which is in line with the standard fee structure and level for most China-domiciled actively managed equity-heavy funds.Both funds had a same total expense ratio in 2021 at 1.76%. From peer relative perspective, both products are competitive in terms of price \u2013 the median and average total expense ratio for aggressive allocation large-cap growth peers were 1.79% and 1.87% respectively.Discrete calendar year performanceFund/Sector YTD 2021 2020 2019 2018 E Fund Management -18.62% 27.61% 64.83% 60.71% -25.49% Franklin Templeton -13.72% 15.3% 64.3% 52.02% -18.16% Source: MorningstarManager reviewE Fund Kexiang\u2019s Chen has 15 years\u2019 investment experience and has been running the fund since 2014. He is backed by a dedicated team of six analyst with seven years\u2019 average investment experience, while he can also leverage research support from E Fund\u2019s research platform with more than 50 sector analysts.Meanwhile, FS Fund Prospect\u2019s Xu has 25 years\u2019 investment experience and also began managing the fund in 2014. He is supported by a team of 13 sector analysts that boast eight years of investment experience on average.\u201cThe manager\u2019s workload is a potential concern for both funds. Chen currently runs seven mandates with similar investment strategy but slightly different investment universe, which collectively have an AUM of Rmb43bn as of 30 September 2022,\u201d said Qu.\u201cOn the other hand, Xu manages five mandates with a total AUM of Rmb6.2bn. Although we don\u2019t have much concern on his investment workload, his increased managerial workload is worth watching \u2013 Xu has been appointed as Franklin Sealand\u2019s deputy general manager in 2022 and he also serves as the team\u2019s chief investment officer.\u201dConclusionOverall, Qu reckons both funds are worth looking at but it gives down to investors\u2019 risk tolerance.\u201cBoth funds benefit from a capable and long-tenured portfolio manager, ample research resources and a structured and consistently applied process. While we have strong conviction in both funds and they performed well on the risk-adjusted basis over the long term, E Fund is more suitable for investors with higher risk appetite given its higher volatility,\u201d she said.",

Les exemples connus se comptent jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent sur les doigts d\u2019une main mais, sur le terrain, les acteurs constatent bien un net repli. \u00c0 la t\u00eate de la Safer d\u00e9partementale, Michel Lachat indiquait dans nos colonnes d\u00e9but novembre ne plus observer \u00ab un engouement important d\u2019acteurs chinois cherchant \u00e0 investir dans les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s bordelaises \u00bb. \u00ab Ils ne sont quasiment plus aux achats, expliquait-il. Pour ceux qui sont en place, les situations sont tr\u00e8s contrast\u00e9es au niveau des groupes propri\u00e9taires. Certains cherchent \u00e0 revendre, d\u2019autres souhaitent s\u2019inscrire dans la dur\u00e9e. \u00bb\u00ab Ils devaient faire un site formidable, brillant \u00e0 l\u2019export, cela est retomb\u00e9 comme un soufflet \u00bb\u00c0 l\u2019abandon\u00c0 Saint-Seurin-de-Cadourne, dans le M\u00e9doc, le maire G\u00e9rard Roi conna\u00eet bien cette situation contrast\u00e9e. L\u2019\u00e9lu s\u2019est un peu gauss\u00e9 quand le ch\u00e2teau Senilhac a \u00e9t\u00e9 rebaptis\u00e9 Antilope tib\u00e9taine il y a quelques ann\u00e9es, sous l\u2019\u00e8re de Chi Keung Tong. \u00ab Ils devaient faire un site formidable, brillant \u00e0 l\u2019export, cela est retomb\u00e9 comme un soufflet. Pendant un temps, les vignes n\u2019\u00e9taient m\u00eame pas entretenues \u00bb, explique-t-il. Mais chez lui, une autre propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u2013 le domaine Andron \u2013 est aussi celle d\u2019autres investisseurs chinois. Et \u00ab si les d\u00e9buts ont \u00e9t\u00e9 compliqu\u00e9s, nuance-t-il, cela se passe plut\u00f4t bien maintenant. \u00bbSur le m\u00eame sujet Vins de Bordeaux : le groupe chinois Haichang a perdu de sa superbe Confront\u00e9 \u00e0 des d\u00e9m\u00eal\u00e9s judiciaires et \u00e0 la politique gouvernementale chinoise, le groupe Haichang, ayant compt\u00e9 une bonne vingtaine de domaines, a d\u00fb sensiblement r\u00e9duire ses ambitionsCertes, leur nombre reste marginal. Mais les exploitations laiss\u00e9es plus ou moins \u00e0 l\u2019abandon se rep\u00e8rent ais\u00e9ment dans le vignoble et peuvent contrarier. Notamment du fait de risque de maladies pour les parcelles des vignerons voisins. \u00ab Nous avons un certain nombre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9s en \u00e9tat de mauvaise culture \u00bb, souligne St\u00e9phane Gabard, \u00e0 la t\u00eate du syndicat des AOC Bordeaux et Bordeaux sup\u00e9rieur. \u00ab Il y a quelques ann\u00e9es, les reprises par des consortiums chinois \u00e9taient de bonnes nouvelles. Aujourd\u2019hui, on constate que certains op\u00e9rateurs ont cess\u00e9 l\u2019exploitation de la vigne de mani\u00e8re temporaire ou plus durable. \u00bbUne cinquantaine de propri\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 la venteLi Lijuan, sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e dans la vente de vignobles, g\u00e8re la client\u00e8le chinoise depuis 2013 chez Christie\u2019s, \u00e0 Bordeaux. Selon elle, une cinquantaine de propri\u00e9t\u00e9s girondines appartenant \u00e0 des investisseurs chinois seraient aujourd\u2019hui propos\u00e9es \u00e0 la vente. Elle doit justement finaliser la cession de l\u2019une d\u2019entre elles dans l\u2019Entre-deux-Mers : une famille fran\u00e7aise va reprendre l\u2019exploitation.Plusieurs raisons expliqueraient cette fuite. \u00ab D\u00e9j\u00e0, notre gouvernement ne veut plus que les fonds sortent de Chine. Sans possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019investir, ces entrepreneurs pr\u00e9f\u00e8rent revendre, dit-elle. Et puis, chez nous, un dicton dit que tout ce qui est liquide fait gagner de l\u2019argent. Mais finalement, cela s\u2019av\u00e8re plus compliqu\u00e9. Les Chinois aiment s\u2019enrichir rapidement, ils sont tr\u00e8s forts g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pour vendre mais ils sont un peu moins port\u00e9s sur tout le processus de fabrication du vin. \u00bb L\u2019agent raconte notamment l\u2019histoire de ce chef d\u2019entreprise se retrouvant avec un stock de centaines de milliers de bouteilles : une piquette invendable.Certains investisseurs n\u2019h\u00e9sitent donc plus \u00e0 l\u00e2cher l\u2019affaire, parfois largement \u00e0 perte. Li Lijuan \u00e9voque ainsi l\u2019exemple d\u2019un important homme d\u2019affaires chinois venant de c\u00e9der son ch\u00e2teau bordelais \u00e0 moiti\u00e9 prix. La transaction demeurera confidentielle. \u00ab Si cela s\u2019\u00e9bruitait, ce serait d\u00e9voiler qu\u2019il a perdu la face \u00bb, pr\u00e9cise-t-elle.153 domaines chinois en GirondeSelon Laurence Lemaire, autrice du livre \u00ab Le Vin, le Rouge, la Chine \u00bb en 2016 et qui tient \u00e0 jour un recensement des domaines fran\u00e7ais dirig\u00e9s par des Chinois, \u00ab il doit en rester 165 dont 153 en Gironde \u00bb, tout de m\u00eame. \u00ab De nombreux ch\u00e2teaux tenus par eux s\u2019en sortent aussi tr\u00e8s bien, nuance l\u2019\u00e9crivaine, habitant Arcachon. Je suis toujours ahurie quand des m\u00e9dias font des articles \u00e0 charge et qu\u2019on ne parle pas de ceux qui affichent une bonne sant\u00e9. \u00bbCar l\u2019investissement chinois n\u2019est \u00e9videmment pas synonyme de ch\u00e2teau fant\u00f4me ou de vente \u00e0 perte. Parmi d\u2019autres exemples, Laurence Lemaire cite celui de Bellefont-Belcier, ce grand cru class\u00e9 de Saint-Emilion tenu par le Hongkongais Peter Kwok et r\u00e9compens\u00e9 tout juste d\u2019un Best of wine d\u2019or, pour la qualit\u00e9 de son h\u00e9bergement.Autre histoire \u00e0 succ\u00e8s, celle du ch\u00e2teau de La Rivi\u00e8re, dans le Fronsadais, pourtant frapp\u00e9 par un tragique accident d\u2019h\u00e9licopt\u00e8re fin d\u00e9cembre 2013 lorsqu\u2019il est pass\u00e9 aux mains de la famille Kok. Tous les ans depuis, des rumeurs l\u2019envoient \u00e0 la vente. Xavier Buffo, son directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, rassure encore une fois sur \u00ab la stabilit\u00e9 \u00bb du domaine qui, chaque \u00e9t\u00e9 durant trois jours, accueille le festival \u00ab Confluent d\u2019arts \u00bb, r\u00e9unissant de nombreux spectacles et plusieurs milliers de visiteurs."

            "description": "NewsBy Louis ThomasQuo Vadis, known as \u2018the Great Dame of Dean Street\u2019, is set to become significantly greater in size as refurbishment plans were announced that will restore it to its former capacity.The much-celebrated London restaurant that, as its website proudly notes, was \u201cformerly a brothel and a home to Karl Marx\u201d is something of a Soho institution, with chef Jeremy Lee\u2019s seasonal, regional British cooking earning the historic eatery a reputation for excellence.In 2016, with the relocation of sister restaurant Barrafina from Frith Street to Dean Street, the size of Quo Vadis was substantially reduced. At the time the decision made sense, as co-owner James Hart told Eater, because: \u201cQuo Vadis was adored but also not very profitable or always full\u2026\u201dBut now, due to lingering doubts over the intervening years about whether the smaller restaurant was optimal, the bullet has been bitten and Quo Vadis will re-expand. Thanks to the makeover, capacity will now double to 40 diners (though this does mean the reception area will somewhat shrink).A statement from Quo Vadis said: \u201cDesign for the reimagined space is being conducted by co-owner, James Hart, who will be removing the imposing revolving door to create a welcoming, though no less arresting, entrance. The door will be painted \u2018Red Stallion II\u2019 and have a large brass knocker. The stained-glass windows, which were never as \u2018original\u2019 or \u2018vintage\u2019 as anyone assumed, will remain in part, as despite their humble background, they are very beautiful. Reception, once vast, will become more \u2018bijou,\u2019 whereas the dining room will be upholstered with red Georgian style dining sofas and a reclaimed Georgian wood floor. We are toying with the idea of a window curtain.\u201d\u201cFor those with \u2018Soho\u2019 as their special subject,\u201d it continued, \u201cno worries should be spent on the fate of the one of the \u2018Seven Noses of Soho,\u2019 which resides on Quo Vadis\u2019 exterior. This is no rhinoplasty. It will however be protected from the elements by a proud new black and white striped awning, emblazoned with the QV monogram.\u201dThe refurbishment does mean that the restaurant will be closed from 2 January to 7 February (the QV Club is not, with the exception of a few days of which members are already aware, affected). However, when it does reopen, it has been said that there will be some new celebratory dishes on the menu to mark the beginning of this new era.Two-years-ago, db spoke with Lee about his food memories, his favourite pairings, and his biggest blunders on the job.",

The days of a single alcohol-free beer in the fridge or spirit on the back bar are long gone, and no/low options now stand toe-to-toe with their alcoholic counterparts in the range and variety they offer. Bartenders are the true purveyors of new trends in the industry, and we at Crossip are proud to be supporting them with this research.\u201dThe research also found that two in five (41%) professionals think no/low spirits will see the fastest growth in the next five years, putting it well clear of other categories like beer (24%) and wine (23%).Dave Lancaster, client director at CGA, said: \u201cBar professionals are helping to make the no and low alcohol category one of the most dynamic parts of Britain\u2019s drinking-out market. Alongside consumers\u2019 rising awareness of the range of quality of drinks that are available, it puts this segment in prime position for more success throughout 2023. Understanding consumers\u2019 needs, optimising range and innovating in flavours and serves will all boost bars in what is set to be another tough and competitive year.\u201d",

Winner: Dubai Duty Free Executive Vice Chairman & CEO Colm McLoughlin.Introducing the award to McLoughlin, event MC and former ARI-Middle East CEO Richard Gray said: \u201cThis individual has shown great leadership, supported his people and significantly influenced sustainability, strategy, culture and development in the region. He is one of the most important and influential name in our industry.\u201cHe was responsible for setting up duty free shops with a team of ten, and a company that grew from a US$20 million to a US$2 billion business, winning over 700 awards over the years.\u201cMEADFA is honoured to celebrate his achievement and success. We celebrate Colm McLoughlin.\u201dAccepting the award on McLoughlin\u2019s behalf, Dubai Duty Free COO Ramesh Cidambi said: \u201cIt is an honour and privilege to receive this award on behalf of Mr. McLoughlin. He is said he cannot be here as he is recovering from an operation but he is thrilled to win this award.\u201cFor us this is a memorable award. More than anyone else Colm was responsible for MEADFA being created, for an office being set up in the Dubai Free Zone, and for being there in the early days.\u201cHis achievements in the duty free industry are legendary. We have never seen a person who has served the industry, served Dubai Duty Free, served the Government of Dubai with such dedication, passion and integrity, as he has over the past 39 years.\u201cFrom a personal perspective, he is a great boss, he is fearless and he has your back whenever you do something. So we are all very proud that he has won this award, and thank MEADFA and the judges for recognising him this evening.\u201dThe MEADFA Conference began on Monday, with organisers pledging to discuss recovery, vital themes such as sustainability and technology, the emerging African market, regulatory challenge, the cruise sector, supply chain, the Metaverse opportunity and much more, including a special focus on host market, Bahrain.\u201cIt is worth noting that Bahrain International Airport never stopped operating during the pandemic,\u201d said Bahrain Airport Company Chief Executive Officer Mohamed Yousif Albinfalah in the morning\u2019s keynote address. \u201cWhile global travel restrictions saw most commercial flights grounded, the airport played a key role in the Kingdom\u2019s fight against the virus, facilitating the import of PPE and urgent medical supplies and helping repatriate stranded Bahraini nationals.\u201cThanks to the exceptional efforts of our people, we overcame all challenges. When the time was finally right, we carried out a safe and seamless transfer of operations to the new facility,\u201d he said of the transition to the Kingdom\u2019s new airport.Boutique appeal\u201cOur 210,000sq m new Passenger Terminal is still among the smaller airports in the region. Fortunately, this boutique design works in our favor for several reasons,\u201d he said.\u201cMany international airports are large, confusing, and even a little overwhelming with few features to distinguish one from another. With Bahrain International Airport, we aimed for quality rather than size, ensuring it is hassle-free, distinct, and very easy to navigate.\u201cThe boutique design means passengers can traverse the arrival and departure areas more quickly than at any other airport in the region, giving them more time to enjoy the amenities Bahrain International Airport has to offer. This includes a wide range of duty free products from leading luxury brands.\u201cHowever, not all boutique airports have the same objectives. Unlike Bahrain International Airport, some boutique terminals focus solely on arrival-to-destination convenience rather than the airport experience. With an emphasis on speed, their goals are to streamline the whole transit process and reduce waiting times. This means no shops and very few places to grab a bite to eat.\u201dWhat makes Bahrain International Airport uniqueHe continued: \u201cWhat makes Bahrain International Airport truly distinct is that it combines the speed and convenience of a smaller airport with the commercial appeal of a much larger one.\u201cIn recent years, airports have begun shifting from a traditional operating model \u2013 aimed at processing passengers as quickly as possible \u2013 towards a more commercial one, focused on the impact non-aeronautical activities have on revenue growth. This is very much part of our commercial strategy.\u201cOne of our most important goals is to deliver a memorable travel experience. Since the inception of the Airport Modernization Program, we have aspired for our new terminal to be much more than just a waiting area for the next flight.\u201cBahrain International Airport\u2019s retail areas are three times larger than the legacy terminal, featuring a broader selection of local and international brands and a diverse range of food and beverage outlets, transforming Bahrain International Airport into a key commercial hub. Among the major new additions are the Bahrain Airport Hotel, an airport clinic, comfortable Arrivals and Departure lounges, an Entertainment Zone, an open-air terrace, and a variety of duty free and food & beverage offerings.\u201cWith 3,300sq m of duty free space in the departures Area, 541sq m of duty free space in the arrivals Area, and 21 cafes and restaurants, the airport caters to the needs of virtually all types of passengers.\u201cFor example, SSP Bahrain \u2013 which is a joint venture with Gulf Air Group Holding \u2013 operates a range of F&B units at Bahrain International Airport. The units offer a strong combination of local and international brands, many of which made their Bahrain debut, including Jamie\u2019s Deli and Pizzeria from world-renowned chef Jamie Oliver. Bahrain International Airport also houses the first TGI Fridays in an airport in the Gulf, further differentiating us from our regional neighbours.\u201cFurthermore, the airport\u2019s Souq Al Qaisariya is a unique retail concept that encapsulates the spirit of Bahrain\u2019s traditional markets. It features a wide selection of locally made products and is one of our signature offerings.\u201d\u201cAs the Kingdom\u2019s only international airport, Bahrain International Airport is an important platform for promoting the Kingdom and is a destination in and of itself. With a broad range of local artwork and cultural artifacts proudly on display at its cultural heritage galleries, passengers can experience the Kingdom\u2019s artistic heritage without having to set foot outside the terminal. Featuring the work of talented Bahraini artists, past and present, Bahrain International Airport is a cultural platform that celebrates the Kingdom\u2019s distinct character.\u201c\u201cBahrain International Airport\u2019s focus on Bahraini art and culture not only spotlights our heritage, but it also makes the airport a more interesting place. This encourages passengers to arrive early and explore everything Bahrain International Airport has to offer, including our impressive duty free area.\u201dIn a rousing conclusion Mohamed Yousif Al Binfalah said, \u201cOld orthodoxies won\u2019t work in this new world; new thinking and new approaches are needed. Coming together at events such as this is crucial to help the airport retail industry recognise and respond to changing customer needs and expectations.\u201cThe airport retail market will recover. But it will take greater collaboration to ensure we emerge from the pandemic more responsive, more agile, and more financially sustainable than ever before.\u201dSUNDAY 27 NOVEMBERThe Art Hotel & Resort is home to MEADFA 2022, where the finishing touches are being put to the stage, ballroom and garden areas before the Welcome Cocktail tonight (courtesy of Dufry) and main plenary sessions, which begin on Monday.",

            "description": "NewsBy Louis ThomasDespite the cost of living crisis, Jeremy Clarkson has called for consumers to pay more for food to support British farmers.For Clarkson, the revelation of how difficult it is for British farmers to make ends meet has been prompted by his own trials and tribulations at his Diddly Squat Farm in Oxfordshire, which is the subject of Amazon Prime series Clarkson\u2019s Farm.Speaking to Jon Sopel and Emily Maitlis on The News Agents podcast, he discussed the threat avian flu is posing to farmers, and suggested that most consumers do not appreciate the time, money and effort that goes into agriculture.\u201cPeople simply don\u2019t pay enough for their food. The one thing a government will never say is \u2018you\u2019ve got to pay more for your food\u2019, so they don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Clarkson went on to say that prices should be double what they are.Later, Clarkson, while recounting the challenges of trying get pigs to mate in the pouring rain, he said: \u201cAnd then somebody\u2019s going to go: \u2018How much for your bacon? Why\u2019re you charging so much?\u2019 Because it costs a fortune to do it!\u201dPerhaps surprisingly, Clarkson did not go on to talk about his Hawkstone beer brand, with its slogan of \u201cdifficult to make, easy to drink\u201d echoing the sentiments expressed in the interview.A report by the National Farmers\u2019 Union (NFU) from October this year noted that, in response to record food inflation (13.9% at the time it was published), consumers are changing both what they shop for, and where they shop: \u201cThey are cutting down on certain products and switching to cheaper alternatives. Be it moving from branded to own label, premium to value ranges, the shift has been significant with sales of the very cheapest, value own-label ranges up by +33%.\u201dThe report also cited Kantar data which suggested that discount supermarket Aldi had gained 1.65 million customers in the 12 weeks up to 2 October.While Clarkson has successfully used his media profile to raise awareness of the issues British farmers face, his efforts to defy the local council and open a restaurant have been much less fruitful.",

Shares of the leading Chinese liquor maker rose.Kweichow Moutai had revenue from sales of CNY100.6 billion between Jan. 1 and yesterday, mainly because of strong demand for Moutai-branded liquor, the Guizhou province-based firm said in a statement the same day. Last year, Moutai-branded products contributed over 90 percent of total sales.Covid-19 flareups in China this year have impacted liquor sales. Tobacco and alcohol sales fell 8.8 percent to CNY46.5 billion in September from a year earlier, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed. But Kweichow Moutai\u2019s nine-month profit and revenue rose over 15 percent.Kweichow Moutai [SHA: 600519] closed up 1.3 percent today at CNY1,539.95 (USD215.82) a share, giving the distiller a market capitalization of CNY1.97 trillion (USD276 billion). The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.1 percent.The company has made great efforts this year to bolster direct sales channels and launched digital sales platform iMoutai. It also introduced Moutai-branded products priced at between CNY200 and CNY2,000 (USD28 and USD280) a bottle.Next month is peak season for baijiu consumption. Kweichow Moutai recently said it is confident of achieving this year\u2019s CNY125.9 billion revenue target, an increase of 15 percent over last year. But that will be tough, given that monthly sales of Moutai-branded liquor averaged CNY8 billion (USD1.1 billion).Editors: Shi Yi, Futura Costaglione",

            "description": "For Singaporean investors, when we think of buying China stocks, we typically think of buying those listed in Hong Kong.That\u2019s because it\u2019s an easily accessible market to international investors with international reporting standards.However, over the past eight years, more international fund managers in Hong Kong have been buying Mainland China A-shares directly. These are stocks listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges.They do this via the Hong Kong Stock Connect Scheme, a two-way stock trading route that links international investors with the Mainland China market and Mainland China residents with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.It\u2019s through this Stock Connect programme that everyday investors like us can buy China A-shares directly. Prior to this, it wasn\u2019t possible for investors to purchase A-shares given China\u2019s restrictive capital markets.So, here\u2019s all Singapore investors need to know about the Hong Kong Stock Connect Scheme.Read Also: Straits Times Index | Hang Seng Index | S&P 500 Index: How To Gain Both Long & Short Exposure To These Indices On SGXFirst Stock Connect established in 2014The first Stock Connect programme was launched in November 2014, connecting the Hong Kong and Shanghai Stock Exchanges.When it initially launched, it was known as a \u201cThrough Train\u201d and there was \u201cNorthbound\u201d trading which meant Hong Kong and international investors buying stocks listed in Mainland China.Meanwhile, Mainland investors buying Hong Kong-listed shares was known as \u201cSouthbound\u201d trading.Following the successful launch of the Hong Kong-Shanghai Stock Connect, the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Stock Connect was then launched in December 2016.In terms of settlement and clearing, Northbound trades for both Shanghai and Shenzhen adopt the same settlement. Timetable \u2013 stock settlement is T day (the day you transact) while money settlement is T+1 day (so you\u2019ll get your money the day after you sell any A-share stocks).Eligibility Of Northbound Stocks Via Hong Kong Stock ConnectIt\u2019s important to note that for Northbound trades, they must be settled in China\u2019s currency; the renminbi (RMB).As for eligibility on the Hong Kong-Shanghai Stock Connect, they include the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) 180 Index constituent stocks, SSE 380 constituent stocks and any A+H listed shares.For the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE), eligible stocks include any of the constituents of the SZSE Component Index and SZSE Small/Mid Cap Innovation Index with a market capitalisation of at least RMB 6 billion (US$842 million).Some examples of some of the largest companies available through the Stock Connect (which aren\u2019t listed anywhere else) include the world\u2019s largest battery maker, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (SZSE: 300750), also known as \u201cCATL\u201d, and Kweichow Moutai Co Ltd (SSE: 600519), the world\u2019s largest baijiu liquor producer.Understanding China A-Shares MarketFor investors here interested in investing directly in Mainland-listed stocks, there are a few nuances we should all be aware of.First off are the trading hours of the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets, which are relatively short.The morning session for both is from 9:30-11:30am. Afternoon trading resumes at 1pm but only goes on until 3pm (when the market closes).That gives investors a total of four trading hours per day when the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets are fully open.As for the tradeable days per year, the Northbound and Southbound links are closed on both the public holidays recognised in Hong Kong and Mainland China.There are a variety of negligible fees for Northbound trading, including a handling fee, securities management fee, transfer fee and stamp duty.However, they\u2019re all calculated as less than 0.005% of the trade, with the exception of stamp duty, which is 0.1% and only imposed on the seller.Differences Between Hong Kong & China MarketsFinally, it\u2019s important to recognise the fact that companies incorporated and listed on Mainland China have a different securities regulator to companies listed in Hong Kong.In China, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) regulates all China-listed companies. Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, the Securities & Futures Commission (SFC) is the public regulator of all listed companies and is an independent statutory body.As such, in each market, there are different disclosure requirements surrounding financial reporting. In Hong Kong, it\u2019s mandatory for companies to report financials in English as that\u2019s the official language of Hong Kong financial reporting standards.However, a lot of the financial statements and management comments in A-share companies\u2019 reports are only in Chinese.Another discerning factor is that Hong Kong\u2019s stock market is also dominated by institutional money.Around 80% of market turnover in Hong Kong comes from large institutions, with the remaining 20% coming from individual retail investors.Meanwhile, in China, the reverse is true. Around 75% of turnover in Shanghai and Shenzhen is derived from retail investors and the remaining 25% comes from institutional activity (although this share is growing).How To Buy China A-SharesMost brokerages in Singapore that offer Hong Kong as a tradeable market should, by default, have access to the Northbound Stock Connect scheme. This means an individual investor here who wants to invest in China A-shares directly via the Northbound Stock Connect can do so.Dividend investors should remember that dividend payouts of A-share companies are imposed with a 10% withholding tax by the Chinese government.Overall, with the Northbound Stock Connect scheme, it has become a lot easier for international investors to buy China A-shares directly.However, it\u2019s important to know the ins and outs of the scheme, as well as doing your due diligence on Chinese companies, before committing any capital.Advertiser MessageLooking to gain exposure to the Hong Kong Stocks here on SGX?You can do so via Daily Leverage Certificates (DLCs) that allows you to gain leveraged exposure of up 7x on key Hang Seng Indices and 5x on Hong Kong Stocks for both Long and Short direction.

            "description": "Employees of a battery company work at a production facility in Bijie, Guizhou province, in August. [LUO DAFU/FOR CHINA DAILY]Guizhou, a Southwest China province with abundant phosphate and manganese ore resources, is stepping up efforts in its lithium battery industry, marking another foray into the new energy sector.Guizhou issued a number of measures in June to further accelerate the construction of major projects and expand effective investment to boost a slew of industries, with a focus on emerging industries such as new energy vehicles, NEV batteries and battery materials.It followed a statement of guidance by the provincial government last year, in which Guizhou vowed to become an important research, development and production base for lithium battery materials by 2025, with a total output value of more than 100 billion yuan ($14.19 billion).In the first three quarters, the province's investment in lithiumion battery manufacturing increased 130.3 percent year-on-year. The local government said the industry is showing strong momentum in the development.According to the local government, Guizhou has abundant phosphate and manganese ore resources \u2014 two key elements in lithium battery manufacturing \u2014 which provide a good foundation for the province to develop the industry. Phosphate ore reserves in Kaiyang county, Fuquan city and Weng'an county amount to nearly 10 billion metric tons, and the mining volume of the metal reached close to 40 million tons per year. Tongren also reported 708 million tons of manganese ore reserves, ranking tops in Asia.The abundant resources and supportive policies have attracted companies to start branches in the province. At present, one of Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd's 10 major battery manufacturing bases is located in Gui'an New Area of Guiyang, capital of Guizhou. With a total land area of about 95.67 hectares and an annual output of 60 gigawatt-hours, the battery manufacturing project is expected to finish in 2025.Pan Chenguang, a manager at the production base, said CATL will also build a low-carbon industrial chain system in Guiyang covering upstream phosphate ore mining, battery material production, lithium battery manufacturing, and downstream battery application and recycling.Referring to why CATL chose Guizhou to build the production base, Pan said the local government has stepped up efforts in developing emerging industries like NEVs and offered supportive policies. In addition, Guizhou has the resources to build complete industrial chains, which creates a good environment for the company's development.CNGR Advanced Materials Co Ltd (CNGR), located in the Dalong Economic and Technological Development Zone, Tongren, is also a company that benefits from Guizhou's development of the NEV battery industrial chain.Founded in Dalong in 2004, the company's major businesses are research and development, production and sales of the materials used in lithium batteries.

NHS guidelines, among other measures, that the afflicted: \u201ceat cool or room temperature foods\u201d, \u201ctry bland foods like rice, boiled potatoes and pasta\u201d, and \u201ctry adding strong flavours or spices to help with taste \u2013 though don\u2019t add too much sugar or salt\u201d. Given how this could have drastically changed the menu, it\u2019s understandable that Fisher outsourced tasting.Fisher, who will be 65 next year, also noted: \u201c\u2026our three children [had with his wife Michelle] have had to work here, practically since they were born, and they are at a time where they all have full-time jobs \u2013 and we want them to go and do their own thing.\u201dOther factors within the industry as a whole also prompted the decision by Fisher to close the restaurant down: \u201cCosts are going to be crippling for restaurants next year, so I think you will find a lot of restaurants will be closing.\u201d Judging by some forecasts, a third of hospitality businesses in the UK are at risk of going bust this winter.The restaurant is now booked until its final service at the end of the year, after which just the bed & breakfast will be open for business.For many in the wine trade in particular, the loss of taste could be a career-ending disaster. However, scientists at Yale may have developed a drug to prevent the loss of senses.",

Just one day after, core consumer inflation was said to have smashed the record 8-year high of 3% announced in SeptemberAs reported by Reuters, the adverse economic situation has contributed to the tough business conditions in Japan\u2019s wine industry. Last month, Suzy Iwamoto, owner of Wine & Weekend shop in Central Tokyo was forced to raise prices on imported wine, including those from the America and Europe, by around 10%.Researcher Teikoku Databank reflected that around 20,000 food and drink items in Japan have gone up in price this year.According to the figures from the US Department of Agriculture, 70% of the wine consumed in Japan is imported, mostly coming from France, Chile, Italy, and the United States.Andrew Dunbar, the president of Iconic Wine Japan, which handles the import of around 30 brands, also raised prices on its wine by 10% across the board in September and will likely have to warn distributors of another hike within another few months.This is especially true of wines from the US, where wine producers are also raising base prices, on top of the drop of the Yen.It is also found that beverage giants Kirin Holdings Co and Suntory Holdings Japan raised the price on their Beaujolais offerings by 40% or more this year, reducing the range at the same time; a shock as Japan has always been the biggest market for France\u2019s Beaujolais Nouveau wines.Eric Jean-Pierre Simon Dahler, the owner of Wine Prosperite, which focuses mostly on French wine, told dbAsia that the cost of importing wine in Japan has never been as high as now, and that his clients, laregly on-trade and private customers, have become very cautious about purchasing.Adding to the Japanese Yen decline, consumer prices have been surging in Japan due to logistics logjams from the Covid pandemic and soaring energy costs caused by the war in Ukraine.",

            "description": "Chinese President Xi Jinping has a vision to distribute wealth more equally across the country. Investors are sobering up to what that could mean for the companies that make the nation\u2019s beloved fiery booze.Mr. Xi recently doubled down on his plans for \u201ccommon prosperity\" during China\u2019s weeklong Communist Party congress in October. Investors are worried that this could portend an industry crackdown, or simply be bad for the future sales of luxury baijiu distillers and companies that sell expensive goods to wealthy people.Shares of Kweichow Moutai Co., a state-owned company whose potent liquor can cost $700 a bottle, tumbled 28% in October to their lowest level in more than two years. The decline erased roughly $100 billion in market capitalization in just a month.The stock\u2019s fall was much steeper than the 7.8% decline in the broader CSI 300 Index of the largest listed companies in mainland China last month. Wuliangye Yibin Co., which also produces baijiu liquor, slid 21% in October. The distillers recouped some losses in the last two days following a market rally fueled by investors\u2019 hopes that China might ease its zero-Covid policy early next year.Shanghai-listed Moutai, long a market darling, has been a popular holding of both international and domestic investors. The distiller makes its version of the potent baijiu spirit in the southern province of Guizhou. The liquor is made from sorghum and has been dubbed \u201cfirewater,\" a nod to its 53% alcohol content. Moutai tastes like strong vodka with hints of soy sauce, and has a strong, sharp finish that some have described as akin to drinking razorblades.Moutai has long been a status symbol in China, often consumed at weddings and lavish business dinners. The company\u2019s consistent double-digit sales growth year after year has resulted in it being classified as a Chinese consumer staple stock, even though its products are highly costly.In September, when Moutai\u2019s market capitalization was at about $330 billion, the company briefly replaced internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. as China\u2019s most valuable publicly listed company.As of this summer, foreign investors held about 7.4% of Moutai\u2019s shares, according to Wind data. But after Mr. Xi started espousing his vision to remake China\u2019s economy during the party congress, international investors pulled the equivalent of $1.8 billion from the stock, taking their ownership down to 6.4% by the end of October. That made up the bulk of the more than $2 billion in foreign outflows from Moutai last month.\u201cThe term \u2018common prosperity\u2019 gave some investors the impression that Xi wants to build an egalitarian society,\" which made them concerned about the distillers\u2019 prospects, said Wong Kok Hoi, founder and chief investment officer of APS Asset Management. The firm is a longtime holder of Moutai shares.Last week, Chinese stocks held by global investors sold off heavily after Beijing unveiled a party leadership packed with Xi loyalists. The Hang Seng Index fell 8.3%, and analysts chalked up much of the losses to pessimism about China\u2019s economic outlook and the fact that it didn\u2019t signal any easing up of its strict Covid restrictions, which have weighed heavily on businesses and consumer spending.Overall, foreign investors pulled the equivalent of $7.9 billion from mainland China\u2019s equity markets in October through the Stock Connect program. It was the second-largest monthly drawdown in the history of the cross-border trading link, and the biggest since March 2020, during a global market selloff in the early months of the coronavirus pandemic.\u201cInvestors have been de-risking after the party congress. People are worried about future demand for baijiu, but there was no evidence of any hostile attitude towards the liquor sector,\" said Min Chen, Head of China at Somerset Capital Management in Singapore. He said the baijiu makers\u2019 steady growth in sales, which have averaged 10% to 15% yearly, is likely to continue.Harsh pandemic lockdowns didn\u2019t significantly damp Chinese consumers\u2019 appetite for Moutai. The distiller reported revenue growth of 11% and 12% in 2020 and 2021, respectively.For the first nine months of this year, Moutai posted the equivalent of $12 billion in revenue, up 17% from the same period a year ago. Its net profit jumped 19% to the equivalent of about $6 billion.Goldman Sachs analysts are also optimistic about Moutai\u2019s prospects. In an Oct. 25 report, the investment bank said the distiller and Wuliangye are two superpremium baijiu brands that can be expected to ride on strong consumer demand. \u201cAffluent consumers are generally under less financial pressure than lower class or middle class,\" the analysts wrote.Mr. Wong, of APS Asset Management, said he thinks Moutai is unlikely to be subject to a damaging regulatory crackdown given that it is a state-owned enterprise and a major contributor to the economy of Guizhou province.\u201cMoutai\u2019s fundamentals have not changed. If anything, the stock is now cheaper and at better value than it was before the congress,\" he said. The company currently trades at about 26 times its earnings for the next 12 months, according to FactSet. That compares with its peak valuation of around 58 times forward earnings in February 2021, and a five-year average of around 32 times.\u2014 Rebecca Feng and Serena Ng contributed to this article.",

            "description": "NewsBy Sarah NeishThe world\u2019s largest drinks groups have been engaged in a flurry of activity, making this autumn one of the busiest periods of portfolio adjustment for some while, reports Ron Emler. The Campari acquisition, announced today, is just one of them.Strengthened by strong free cash flows and the readjusting of debt portfolios while cheap interest rates existed has triggered a significant jockeying for position as global trading conditions gradually return to normal.Today Campari has announced buying 70% of Wilderness Trail Distillery, a super premium Bourbon whiskey range and that it will take over the full company by 2031. Chief executive Bob Kunze-Concewitz said the takeover will make Bourbon the \u201csecond major legafter the aperitif portfolio\u201d.It will give Campari a significant extra offering in the key American spirits market and will add to last week\u2019s purchase of a 15% stake in London-based Catalyst Spirit, the incubator house behind Howler Head Kentucky straight Bourbon. They both add to Wild Turkey in its portfolio.Kunze-Concewitz sees Bourbon as vital to the group\u2019s growth. The enterprise value of Wilderness Trail is US$600m.In the summer Campari bought Picon, the leading bitter aperitif brand in France, from Diageo for \u20ac119m. The desire to widen its portfolio into a fast-growing sector is behind Jack Daniel\u2019s owner Brown-Forman\u2019s swoop on the Spanish owned Diplomatico rum brand for an undisclosed sum. It is the leading super and ultra premium rum in the US in a category that has grown at a combined annual rate of 17% over the past five years.For its part, Diageo has been very active. After selling the Archers peach liqueur brand to De Kuyper Royal Distillers (giving the Dutch company a virtual monopoly of peach-based spirits) it then bought the Australian premium cold brew coffee liqueur Mr Black, which is the category leader in the US. That move followed taking an Initial stake in Mr Black in 2015 via Diageo\u2019s own incubator stable, Distill Ventures. No prices were disclosed for either transaction but Diageo\u2019s Indian subsidiary, United Spirits, received some \u00a390m when it completed the already-announced sale of 32 commodity brands to Inbrew.That allows USL to concentrate its focus on Diageo\u2019s premium and imported spirits portfolio as it drives towards extra premiumisation and greater margins in the sub continent.Diageo has also been active in further shaping its beer portfolio in Africa. In the summer it sold Guinness Cameroon to Castel for \u00a3389m. The move was made to exploit Castel\u2019s more dynamic distribution system in the country, where it will brew Guinness under licence.Return on capital invested was very much in Diageo\u2019s thinking when it announced it would increase its stake in East African Breweries up to a maximum of 65% via a tender issue, a transaction that could cost it up to approximately \u00a3160m. While it does not intend an eventual full-takeover, Diageo is paying a 40% premium for the extra stake in EAB, which has seen its shares halve in value since 2015.The drive to supply China with non-Australian sourced Penfolds triggered Treasury Wine Estates\u2019 acquisition of a majority stake in Chateau Lanesson in Bordeaux. That gives Treasury some 390 hectares to add to its other vineyards in France, California and Chinaitself to supply wines to the People\u2019s Republic after Beijing imposed punitive tariffs on Australian production as part of the ongoing political spat about human rights and the origins of the Covid-19 virus.Back in June, Ann Muckerjee, the head of Pernod Ricard\u2019s US operation, surprised analysts when she said the French group did not need to \u201cwin\u201d the Tequila war raging in America. She was seeking to emphasise that despite soaring demand for premium agave spirits in the world\u2019s most profitable market, the strength of the other brands in its portfolio and the data based programmes behind them would drive extra profitability for the French company.Since then Pernod Ricard has taken a majority stake Cordego 1530, the ultra premium and prestige Tequilas to add to its Olmeca, Altos and Avion offerings. It has also bolstered its presence in the market for Mexican spirits by joining forces with Casa Lumbre (which produces the Oje de Tigre mezcal) to develop the sotol brand Nocheluna, which will be launched in the US in the near future.Some 29% of Pernod Ricard\u2019s sales come from the US compared with 39% of Diageo\u2019s. As part of its drive to increase that proportion the French group has agreed to \u201csignificantly\u201d increase its minority stake in the Sovereign Brands\u2019 portfolio of super premium wine and spirits brands.Sovereign is described as \u201cone of the fastest growing companies in the beverage alcohol industry\u201d with products such as a super premium French sparkling wine Luc Belaire and a range of Caribbean rums. The two are collaborating on incubating products.Pernod Ricard will have the option of further increasing its stake in Sovereign at a later date. In 10 days\u2019 time we will learn whether Constellation Brands\u2019 shareholders have agreed to end their two-tier share structure at a cost of about $1.5 billion. While the Sands family will still control almost a third of the company, the restructuring will make Constellation more attractive as a potential merger partner and more readily able to finance any takeover activity through the issue of shares.But even before that Constellation has moved to unscramble its longer-term relationship with Canopy Growth, the Canadian cannabis group in which it made a $4bn investment which it recently wrote down by US$1.1 billion.Canopy is consolidating its US assets under one umbrella in anticipation of eventual Congressional approval of cannabis products.Constellation remains convinced this is a major source of new profitability but plans to convert its holding of 36% into exchangeable (sellable) shares in return for withdrawing from Canopy\u2019s board and management. Together with the revised share structure, Constellation will become more streamlined an attractive to investors.Finally, while not M&A activity, Remy Cointreau is also branching out through launching a super-premium fragrance brand, Maison Psyche, echoing LVMH in combining the skills of perfumery and distillation to create ultra luxury and a broader appeal among the rich.",

            "description": "Tencent, the Chinese tech and gaming colossus that you'll know for owning a slice of seemingly everything in the games industry, is no longer China's most valuable company. Bloomberg reports that Tencent's stock price has hit a five-year low, and its overall market capitalisation was overtaken late last month by\u2014of all things\u2014Kweichow Moutai, a Guizhou-based firm specialising in the production of Maotai rice wine. At time of writing, Kweichow Moutai had a $235 million lead over Tencent's market cap.This would have been unthinkable just last year, when Tencent was trading at between $50 and $90 per share and was easily the most valuable company in China, but Tencent's fortunes have been brought low by the increasingly hostile domestic environment. A combination of China's tech crackdown, strict COVID policies, and generally flagging economic growth have made it hard for Tencent\u2014and plenty of other Chinese companies\u2014to do business. Tencent has wiped $650 billion off its market cap since the beginning of 2021.The downturn in its fortunes has led Tencent to pursue a strategy of downsizing, imposing a wave of firings in departments across China in an effort to make up for its losses. The frosty Chinese market even partially explains Tencent's ever-growing presence in the western games market: it's been buying up non-Chinese companies precisely because it's currently so tough to do business at home.The struggle shows no sign of letting up. Tencent got its first game approval from the Chinese government in over a year this September, and it's not like COVID is going anywhere any time soon. We can probably expect the company to continue cutting back at home and expanding abroad in the foreseeable future. Kweichow Moutai, on the other hand, stands to benefit from promised government support for \"consumer-driven\" sectors. Maybe Tencent should just pivot into liquor production.This is far from the end of the road for a company as massive as Tencent, but it is a stark illustration of how bleak things are looking for Chinese tech companies at the minute. Nevertheless, Tencent still has fingers in plenty of pies: aside from its stock woes, Tencent has most recently been in the news for penning deals with Ubisoft, trying and failing to make a Lord of the Rings MMO with Amazon, and opening up an AI-governed nightmare hotel in Hangzhou. Not bad for what is now only China's second most valuable company.",

            "description": "Foi a partir de 2008, quando os Estados Unidos e a Europa mergulharam na pior crise financeira em d\u00e9cadas, que o caso de amor da China com os vinhos franceses atingiu um novo patamar. Enquanto o Ocidente enfrentava os efeitos severos da tempestade econ\u00f4mica, a na\u00e7\u00e3o da Muralha produziu bilion\u00e1rios em ritmo jamais visto. Para os chineses muito ricos, configurou-se o cen\u00e1rio perfeito: de bolsos cheios, viam surgir in\u00fameras oportunidades no mercado. No ramo da vinicultura, as pechinchas pareciam estar concentradas especialmente em Bordeaux, regi\u00e3o francesa respons\u00e1vel por nomes lend\u00e1rios como Ch\u00e2teau Margaux e Ch\u00e2teau Lafite Rothschild. Sedentos por bons neg\u00f3cios, os investidores chineses come\u00e7aram a comprar, em ritmo acelerado, diversas vin\u00edcolas locais, mirando quase sempre propriedades que enfrentavam dificuldades financeiras. No auge do frenesi, 170 vinhedos, o equivalente a 2% de todas as propriedades vin\u00edcolas de Bordeaux, estavam nas m\u00e3os de chineses. Agora, contudo, o que se v\u00ea \u00e9 um movimento que vai na dire\u00e7\u00e3o opostaH\u00e1 atualmente uma debandada de investidores chineses na regi\u00e3o de Bordeaux. Alguns est\u00e3o vendendo as propriedades a novos compradores, outros tiveram seus contratos encerrados por disputas judiciais, e um terceiro grupo simplesmente abandonou os ch\u00e2teaux, que agora est\u00e3o fechados e sem produzir um \u00fanico r\u00f3tulo. O n\u00famero exato de vin\u00edcolas que mudaram de m\u00e3os \u00e9 incerto, mas s\u00e3o cada vez mais corriqueiros relatos de chineses que deixaram o sonho franc\u00eas para tr\u00e1s.O movimento \u00e9 reflexo, pelo menos em boa dose, de uma medida recente do governo Xi Jinping, que decidiu aumentar a vigil\u00e2ncia sobre o desvio de dinheiro e impor medidas r\u00edgidas de controle de capital para manter os gastos dos bilion\u00e1rios dentro das fronteiras chinesas. Foi assim que alguns investidores foram impossibilitados de realizar aportes \u2014 que j\u00e1 haviam sido aprovados, ressalte-se \u2014 na moderniza\u00e7\u00e3o das vin\u00edcolas, e viram as portas do mercado interno chin\u00eas se fecharem para os r\u00f3tulos vindos da Fran\u00e7a.Continua ap\u00f3s a publicidadeA descoberta de esc\u00e2ndalos de corrup\u00e7\u00e3o foi outro complicador para a perman\u00eancia dos asi\u00e1ticos nos territ\u00f3rios vin\u00edcolas franceses. A fabricante chinesa de bebidas alco\u00f3licas Kweichow Moutai, com valor de mercado estimado em 500 bilh\u00f5es de d\u00f3lares, se desfez do Ch\u00e2teau Loudenne, um conhecido vinhedo em Bordeaux, ap\u00f3s rumoroso caso de desvio de recursos. O epis\u00f3dio foi t\u00e3o s\u00e9rio que levou \u00e0 pris\u00e3o perp\u00e9tua do presidente da empresa, Yuan Renguo. Tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 preciso destacar as barreiras impostas pelas diverg\u00eancias culturais. Muitos investidores chineses compraram vin\u00edcolas em busca de lucro r\u00e1pido, mas a ind\u00fastria do vinho, em especial na Fran\u00e7a, funciona em ritmo completamente diferente. Por se tratar de um produto agr\u00edcola, \u00e9 preciso tempo \u2014 e paci\u00eancia \u2014 para as investidas financeiras darem bons frutos. A pr\u00f3pria rotina de trabalho \u00e9 diversa. De acordo com o Minist\u00e9rio de Agricultura franc\u00eas, os funcion\u00e1rios das vin\u00edcolas devem trabalhar apenas 35 horas por semana, e na Fran\u00e7a as determina\u00e7\u00f5es oficiais s\u00e3o cumpridas \u00e0 risca. Para os chineses, acostumados ao sistema 996, que imp\u00f5e uma jornada herc\u00falea das 9 \u00e0s 21 horas durante seis dias por semana, foi um choque de realidade. \u201cMesmo que se trabalhe para garantir qualidade e uma boa distribui\u00e7\u00e3o, \u00e9 imposs\u00edvel desassociar o mercado de bens de luxo da tradi\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d, afirma Alan Kuhar, professor de marketing da ESPM. \u201cEm Bordeaux, onde os pr\u00f3prios vinhedos t\u00eam centenas de anos, n\u00e3o adianta impor uma l\u00f3gica de produtividade.\u201dNem todas as hist\u00f3rias envolvendo investimentos chineses em Bordeaux, contudo, s\u00e3o marcadas por decep\u00e7\u00f5es. \u00c9 o caso do Ch\u00e2teau Monlot, comprado em 2011 pela atriz Zhao Wei. A nova propriet\u00e1ria fez in\u00fameras interven\u00e7\u00f5es na propriedade e quer tornar o espa\u00e7o um destino enotur\u00edstico. O Ch\u00e2teau de Sours, comprado pelo empres\u00e1rio Jack Ma, fundador do grupo Alibaba, \u00e9 outro exemplo bem-\u00adsucedido. Mas eles s\u00e3o cada vez mais raros. No mundo dos vinhos, o encontro entre chineses e franceses n\u00e3o rende mais bons brindes.Publicado em VEJA de 26 de outubro de 2022, edi\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00ba 2812"

Il colosso cinese, che negli ultimi anni si sta imponendo come una delle pi\u00f9 grandi protagoniste del mercato dell\u2019intrattenimento (e non solo), ha infatti perso ben 650 miliardi di dollari in poco pi\u00f9 di un anno.Il colosso cinese della tecnologia e dei videogiochi, riporta Bloomberg, ha toccato il suo minimo storico in borsa negli ultimi cinque anni, perdendo il suo posto come prima azienda della Cina. La sua capitalizzazione di mercato complessiva \u00e8 stata infatti superata alla fine del mese scorso da Kweichow Moutai, un\u2019azienda con sede a Guizhou specializzata nella produzione di vino di riso Maotai.Solo l\u2019anno scorso, le azioni di Tencent venivano vendute per una cifra compresa tra 50 e 90 dollari l\u2019una, ma la repressione tecnologica cinese, le rigide politiche per il COVID e la crescita economica debole hanno affossato le aspettative del colosso, che dall\u2019inizio del 2021 ha perso la bellezza di 650 miliardi di dollari dalla sua capitalizzazione di mercato.Le recenti strategie di Tencent, in effetti, sono un riflesso di ci\u00f2 che sta accadendo nel territorio di Pechino. L\u2019azienda si sta infatti espandendo in Occidente con acquisizioni importanti e sta ridimensionando i suoi impianti in terra natale, proprio per le difficolt\u00e0 incontrate.Tencent ha comunque in programma molti altri progetti. Solo pochi mesi fa l\u2019azienda ha acquisito parte delle quote di From Software insieme a Sony, e secondo alcuni rumor potrebbe anche essere interessata ad assorbire Square Enix.Fonte",

            "description": "What would it say about US innovation and President Joe Biden\u2019s stewardship of the economy if America\u2019s largest beer company, Anheuser-Busch InBev, had a bigger market capitalisation than Apple? Nothing good, probably, and indeed the very thought is a ridiculous one. Apple\u2019s $2.2tn market cap is almost 28 times larger than AB InBev\u2019s $80bn.But that is exactly what happened recently in China, where Xi Jinping is about to embark on a third term as Communist party leader, military commander-in-chief and state president. Late last month China\u2019s most famous liquor maker, Kweichow Moutai, overtook Tencent as the country\u2019s most valuable company.How can this be? Tencent is one of the most innovative and successful technology companies in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. It developed the country\u2019s most popular instant messaging and social media app, WeChat, and its WePay online payments platform is second only to Alibaba\u2019s Alipay. Kweichow Moutai, which brews a strong-smelling, 76 to 106-proof grain liquor, sells hangovers.Politics is how, or at least Chinese Communist party politics as transformed by Xi over the past decade. Xi\u2019s third term will officially begin on Sunday, October 23, almost two years from the day on which an impolitic speech by Alibaba\u2019s founder, Jack Ma, triggered Beijing\u2019s ongoing regulatory crackdown on the technology sector.Speaking on October 24, 2020, Jack Ma castigated China\u2019s state-owned banking sector for its conservatism and sloth at a financial forum in Shanghai. Ma was correct in his criticism of the banking sector\u2019s traditional neglect of the small and medium-sized enterprises.\u201cJack always understood that in markets dominated by large corporations and state-owned enterprises, technology could be the great equaliser for SMEs,\u201d Brian Wong, a former senior Alibaba executive, writes in a forthcoming book on the company. \u201cHis real mission was spreading opportunity beyond traditional elite circles . . . [by] developing a platform for neglected entrepreneurs to thrive, compete and spread prosperity on a far more equitable basis than China had experienced before.\u201dUnfortunately for his shareholders, Ma was not preaching to the converted. Other forum VIPs included vice-president Wang Qishan, the architect of Xi\u2019s anti-corruption campaign and a former state bank boss, as well as a number of senior financial regulators. Ma appeared to forget that Xi and Wang do not appreciate lesser mortals speaking truth to power. Within a fortnight the initial public offering of Ma\u2019s online finance group, Ant, was cancelled by Chinese regulators.Ant\u2019s $37bn IPO would have been the world\u2019s largest. Since the speech, the price of Alibaba\u2019s Hong Kong-traded shares has fallen more than 75 per cent. While Tencent\u2019s HK$2.37tn ($301bn) market cap is at least neck-and-neck with Kweichow Moutai\u2019s HK$2.38tn, Alibaba\u2019s \u2014 HK$1.56tn \u2014 is nowhere close.In his book, Wong documents his former boss\u2019s passion \u2014 and talent \u2014 for disruption. Revealing anecdotes include the time in 2011 that Alibaba broke China\u2019s postal system. He writes that, on its famous November 11 or \u201cSingles\u2019 Day\u201d sales festival that year, \u201cit took [China Post] months to finish delivering all the packages ordered that day\u201d.When the same thing happened a year later, Ma decided he would have to develop an in-house delivery arm. The result was Cainiao, which means \u201crookie\u201d in Chinese, and a revolution in China\u2019s logistics industry.A factory in coastal Guangdong province, Wong writes, can now ship a mobile phone to a customer 1,500 miles inland in three days for just Rmb15 ($2.08). He adds that \u201ca similar package shipped using the UPS three-day service from Boston to Reno, covering roughly the same distance, will cost more than 10 times that amount\u201d.On October 16, Xi told the party congress that \u201cwe will encourage entrepreneurship, move faster to help Chinese companies become world-class outfits and support the development of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises\u201d.\u201cBeen there, was doing just that\u201d Tencent and Alibaba executives might reply. As for Kweichow Moutai, it too might soon discover that its fortunes ultimately hinge on one man\u2019s whims. Since overtaking Tencent as China\u2019s most valuable company, the price of its Shanghai-traded shares has fallen around 8 per cent \u2014 partly on rumours that Xi might ban alcohol at party and government functions.tom.mitchell@ft.com",

You can opt-out at any time.AdvertisementTencent's nearly six-year reign as China's most valued company may be over.Once worth nearly $1 trillion, the gaming and internet giant now hovers at less than half of its peak market value. On September 30, Tencent lost its status as China's most valuable company when its market capitalization dipped below that of Guizhou-based distiller Kweichow Moutai.That means its value fell from $950 billion in January 2021 to around $325 billion in less than 22 months, per Bloomberg.As of Tuesday afternoon, Tencent has regained a narrow lead over Kweichow Moutai, with a market capitalization of $302.5 billion to Kweichow Moutai's $300.1 billion, per Bloomberg's data.AdvertisementKweichow Moutai is a household name in China. Its iconic Moutai Baijiu is a fiery 53% alcohol liquor that's commonly consumed during business dinners. The drink was famously served to Richard Nixon on his historic 1972 trip to China.The distiller's profits surged 19.1% in the last nine months, which analysis group Yicai Global attributed to an uptick in sales at the distiller's brick-and-mortar stores and the success of its new online retail platform, iMoutai.Tencent did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.Harsh restrictions on tech giants spelled the end of Tencent's glory daysMoutai liquor is placed in a liquor store in Moutai town in Guizhou province. Costfoto/Future Publishing via Getty ImagesThat Kweichou Moutai's market value could even be compared to Tencent's shows how far the tech behemoth has fallen.AdvertisementTencent's star status was thought to have been cemented during the mid-2010s when its powerhouse app, WeChat, became the super app for every online service imaginable \u2014 from texting and video calls to gaming, restaurant bookings, ride-hailing, food delivery, and paying bills.WeChat's built-in payment platform, WePay, is rivaled only by Alibaba's Alipay in a country where cashless payment is so ubiquitous that even beggars in Beijing use it to ask for change by displaying QR codes on makeshift signs.Tencent's rapid descent came less than a year after it posted a $950 billion market capitalization in January 2021, when its value was growing nearly twice as fast as Tesla's, according to Bloomberg. At the time, another tech juggernaut, Alibaba, saw its fortunes fouled and its historic IPO plans ruined when China accused it of violating its restrictions on forming monopolies.Beijing's regulatory measures came for Tencent, too, in 2021, when the Chinese government introduced new rules on antitrust between internet companies and clamped down on video gaming for Chinese minors.AdvertisementIn November, Tencent was told it would have to receive approval from regulators before publishing any new apps or sending updates to devices.This drive to curb the Chinese tech industry's previously unbridled growth comes directly from President Xi Jinping, who has regularly promoted \"common prosperity,\" or the idea of redistributing China's wealth among the nation. In August, Xi lauded his government's efforts to halt \"barbarous growth\" and \"irrational expansion\" from the tech sector.The Chinese leader has also shown no indication that he's changed his stance. Xi exhorted the need for a \"common prosperity\" during his speech at this week's Communist Party Congress, which opened on Sunday.Xi is expected to secure a third term and consolidate his position as China's paramount leader at the landmark meeting.",

            "description": "| 15.10.2022 10:08 UhrArchiv-Beitrag: Dieser Artikel ist \u00e4lter als ein Jahr.Am 16. Oktober wird die Kommunistische Partei Chinas (KPC) ihren 20. Parteitag abhalten, und es wird erwartet, dass sich Pr\u00e4sident Xi Jinping eine beispiellose dritte Amtszeit sichert. Nachdem im vergangenen Jahr zahlreiche regulatorische \u00c4nderungen Teile des chinesischen Marktes umgekrempelt haben, fragen sich viele internationale Investoren, ob China \u00fcberhaupt noch investierbar ist. F\u00fcr sie ist der Parteitag eine weitere Erinnerung, dass der chinesische Markt stark von der Politik beeinflusst wird. F\u00fcr Investoren, die den politischen L\u00e4rm und die Fallstricke meiden, bleibt China allerdings nach wie vor ein attraktiver Markt, stellt Jasmine Kang, Portfoliomanagerin der China-Strategie von Comgest, fest.W\u00e4hrend der 20. Parteikongress n\u00e4her r\u00fcckt, hat China mit zahlreichen Krisen zu k\u00e4mpfen, darunter etwa die Null-COVID-Politik, die die Wirtschaft ausgebremst hat, und einer ganzen Welle neuer regulatorischer Vorschriften. Die Liste der Fragen f\u00fcr Investoren ist lang: Welche Auswirkungen h\u00e4tte ein Technologie- oder Handelskrieg auf chinesische Unternehmen? Wie wird sich das regulatorische Umfeld entwickeln? Welche politische Richtung wird Pr\u00e4sident Xi Jinping k\u00fcnftig einschlagen? All diese Unsicherheiten haben zu der hohen Volatilit\u00e4t des chinesischen Aktienmarktes beigetragen.Investieren in China: Die Vorteile s\u00e4kularer Trends nutzenDa die Zirkel der Macht in Peking undurchsichtiger sein k\u00f6nnen als in anderen L\u00e4ndern, ist es in der Regel schwierig, die Richtung der chinesischen Politik vorherzusagen. Bei Comgest versuchen wir, die Ziele der Regierung und die regulatorischen Risiken bei der Auswahl von Aktien zu ber\u00fccksichtigen, indem wir uns fragen, ob unsere Portfoliounternehmen mit den langfristigen Zielen der chinesischen Regierung vereinbar sind oder nicht. Dann konzentrieren wir uns auf Unternehmen, die von den verschiedenen s\u00e4kularen Wachstumstrends in China profitieren, die wir in unseren Analysen identifiziert haben und die mit den Zielen der Regierung kompatibel sind.Einige dieser Trends sind auf die Politik des \u201egemeinsamen Wohlstands\u201c von Pr\u00e4sident Jinping zur\u00fcckzuf\u00fchren, die nach Angaben der Regierung darauf abzielt, das wachsende Wohlstandsgef\u00e4lle zu verringern.[1] Auch wenn einige Anleger diese Politik als einseitig negativ ansehen und der Meinung sind, dass Massenkonsumg\u00fcter den gr\u00f6\u00dften Vorteil daraus ziehen werden, glauben wir, dass sie viele lokale Chancen bieten k\u00f6nnte. Aufstrebende einheimische Marken sollten davon profitieren, dass die wachsende Mittelschicht des Landes ihren Konsum steigert \u2013 insbesondere Unternehmen, die \u201eguochao\u201c repr\u00e4sentieren, d. h. die Vorliebe j\u00fcngerer Chinesen f\u00fcr einheimische Marken und \u201eChina-Chic\u201c.[2] Anta Sports, das drittgr\u00f6\u00dfte Unternehmen auf dem chinesischen Sportbekleidungsmarkt, ist ein Beispiel f\u00fcr ein einheimisches Unternehmen, das seinen Marktanteil stetig ausbauen konnte.[3] Der traditionelle Hersteller hochwertiger Baijiu-Spirituosen, Kweichow Moutai, ist heute in den Haushalten der chinesischen Mittelschicht pr\u00e4sent.[4] Inner Mongolia Yili, Chinas gr\u00f6\u00dftes Unternehmen f\u00fcr Milchprodukte, hat ebenfalls Marktanteile gegen\u00fcber ausl\u00e4ndischen Marken gewonnen, etwa bei Instant-Babynahrung, wo das Unternehmen nach einem Skandal im Jahr 2012 dank sicherer Beschaffung, Innovation und Markenst\u00e4rke das Vertrauen junger Paare zur\u00fcckgewonnen hat.[5],[6] Die Politik des \u201egemeinsamen Wohlstands\u201c, die darauf abzielt, der Mittelschicht ein gr\u00f6\u00dferes St\u00fcck vom Konsumkuchen zu geben, hat sich insofern positiv auf einheimische verbraucherorientierte Unternehmen mit starken Marken und hohem Innovationsgrad ausgewirkt.In Marktf\u00fchrer und technologische Vorreiter investierenAuch beim Thema saubere Energie hat China eine klare und positive politische Richtung eingeschlagen, mit vielen inl\u00e4ndischen Anreizen zur Reduzierung von Kohlenstoffemissionen und Umweltverschmutzung.[7] Mit staatlicher Unterst\u00fctzung und dem Ziel, ein Hightech-Produktionszentrum zu werden, haben chinesische Unternehmen technologisches Know-how in Wachstumsm\u00e4rkten wie der Elektromobilit\u00e4t entwickelt. So ist etwa das 2003 gegr\u00fcndete Unternehmen Bafang Electric einer der weltweit gr\u00f6\u00dften Hersteller von Elektromotoren f\u00fcr E-Bikes und konkurriert mit etablierten Unternehmen wie Shimano und Bosch. Ein weiteres Beispiel ist Xinyi Solar, der weltweit gr\u00f6\u00dfte Hersteller von Solarglas.Chinesische Unternehmen werden zunehmend auch zu technologischen Vorreitern: Sie investieren mehr in Forschung und Entwicklung, um die Qualit\u00e4t ihrer Produkte und Dienstleistungen zu steigern. Dieser Trend ist in allen Branchen zu beobachten, insbesondere auf dem schnell wachsenden Gesundheitsmarkt des Landes. Shenzhen Mindray Bio-Medical ist ein chinesischer Marktf\u00fchrer im Bereich der Medizintechnik, und obwohl 50 Prozent des Umsatzes in China erwirtschaftet werden, ist das Unternehmen auch international erfolgreich \u2013 in der H\u00e4matologie steht es weltweit an f\u00fcnfter Stelle.W\u00e4hrend Unternehmen mit fortschrittlichem technologischem Know-how in China stark gef\u00f6rdert werden, bestehen aufgrund der anhaltenden geopolitischen Spannungen, insbesondere mit den USA, ernsthafte Investitionsrisiken. Ein Technologiekrieg zwischen China und den USA k\u00f6nnte beispielsweise die Wachstumschancen der Halbleiter- und Biotech-Unternehmen des Landes stark einschr\u00e4nken.[8]Jasmine Kang, Portfoliomanagerin der China-Strategie von ComgestPerformanceergebnisse der Vergangenheit lassen keine R\u00fcckschl\u00fcsse auf die zuk\u00fcnftige Entwicklung eines Investmentfonds oder Wertpapiers zu. Wert und Rendite einer Anlage in Fonds oder Wertpapieren k\u00f6nnen steigen oder fallen. Anleger k\u00f6nnen gegebenenfalls nur weniger als das investierte Kapital ausgezahlt bekommen. Auch W\u00e4hrungsschwankungen k\u00f6nnen das Investment beeinflussen. Beachten Sie die Vorschriften f\u00fcr Werbung und Angebot von Anteilen im InvFG 2011 \u00a7128 ff.

            "description": "Dar\u00fcber hinaus ist jetzt auch das typisch chinesische Modell des Hausverkaufs in Gefahr. Der sogenannte Vorverkauf, bei dem Entwickler Wohneinheiten \u201cauf dem Papier\u201d (\u671f\u623f q\u012bf\u00e1ng) an Endkunden verkaufen, machte 2021 circa 90 Prozent des Umsatzes aus. Mit diesem Cashflow sollten Entwickler eigentlich angehalten sein, die Wohnungsprojekte zum Abschluss zu bringen. Gesetzlich geregelt ist das Ganze aber nirgends. H\u00e4ufig wurden die Gelder von eifrigen Baul\u00f6wen dazu benutzt, die n\u00e4chsten Landk\u00e4ufe f\u00fcr noch gr\u00f6\u00dfere Bauvorhaben zu finanzieren.Inzwischen kommt es landesweit zu sogenannten \u201cHypothekenboykotts\u201d. Betroffen sind \u00fcber 300 Immobilienprojekte und zwei Prozent von allen ausstehenden Hypothekendarlehen, immerhin 245 Milliarden Dollar. Um all dies aufzufangen, k\u00f6nnten auf die Lokalregierungen massive Neuschulden zukommen. Denn letztlich geht es darum, soziale Unruhen zu verhindern und das Vertrauen in den Immobilienmarkt wiederherzustellen. Wer sich die Videos zu den Boykotts Anfang Juli in Zhengzhou, der Hauptstadt der Provinz Henan, anschaut, wei\u00df wovor die Zentralregierung Angst hat.Guter Rat ist teuer f\u00fcr Xi Jinping und dies nicht nur sprichw\u00f6rtlich. Einerseits muss er mit kr\u00e4ftigen Stimuli den Wohnungsmarkt wieder neu beleben. Das kostet Geld, das die bereits unter Zero-Covid leidenden Lokalregierungen nicht haben. Jetzt steigt also auch noch die Neuschuldenaufnahme. Nicht vergessen werden darf in diesem Kontext, dass die fiskalischen Einnahmen der Lokalregierungen sich in 2021 zu 42 Prozent aus Landverk\u00e4ufen speisten. Dass etwas faul ist im Staate China, zeigt die Statistik, wonach im Jahr 2000 nur 6 Prozent der lokalen Gelder aus solchen Quellen stammten. Doch neue Landk\u00e4ufe k\u00f6nnen sich die gebeutelten privaten Immobilienentwickler nicht mehr leisten. Vermehrt m\u00fcssen die staatlichen Immobilienentwickler und sogenannte \u201cLocal Government Financing Vehicle\u201d (LGFV) einspringen. In gewisser Hinsicht kauft sich der Staat das Land jetzt selber ab.Andererseits hat Xi Jinping alles daran gesetzt, dass die privaten chinesischen Immobilienentwickler nach Jahren des Exzesses ihre Schulden abbauen. Gerade durch die Einf\u00fchrung der \u201cDrei Roten Linien\u201d (\u4e09\u9053\u7ea2\u7ebf) im Grunde ein strenger Balance Sheet Test f\u00fcr die Branche \u2013 ist es zu den anfangs gewollten Restrukturierungen bei den Riesen der Branche wie Evergrande vor einem Jahr gekommen. Immer wieder wird auf den Parteiveranstaltungen gepredigt, dass Wohnungen eben zum Wohnen da sind und nicht f\u00fcr Spekulationen (\u623f\u5b50\u662f\u7528\u6765\u4f4f\u7684\uff0c\u4e0d\u662f\u7528\u6765\u6284\u7684). Wer das Ernst meint, kann jetzt nicht wieder klein beigeben. Die demographische Entwicklung des Landes legt ebenfalls nahe, dass in Zukunft nicht mehr so viele neue Wohnungen wie noch in der Vergangenheit gebraucht werden. Auch die Migrationsbewegung vom Land in die St\u00e4dte, die h\u00e4ufig als guter Grund f\u00fcr neue Wohnungsbauvorhaben herhalten musste, hat sich stark verlangsamt.Der Wirtschaftsmotor der letzten Jahrzehnte mit Immobilien- und Infrastrukturinvestitionen an seiner Spitze ist, um es milde auszudr\u00fccken, arg l\u00e4diert. Wenn Xi Jinping nicht in alte Muster zur\u00fcckfallen will, muss er eine schmerzhafte Neubalancierung wagen. Weitere angebotsseitige Reformversuche (supply-side reforms and stimuli) werden nicht mehr ausreichen. Denn das Hauptproblem ist, dass die Konsumausgaben der privaten Haushalte in China weniger als 40 Prozent des chinesischen BIPs ausmachen, im Vergleich zu einem globalen Durchschnitt in anderen L\u00e4ndern von etwa 60 Prozent.Deshalb ist es dringend notwendig, den Konsumanteil am BIP nachhaltig zu erh\u00f6hen. Chinesische Haushalte m\u00fcssen einen gr\u00f6\u00dferen Anteil ihrer Produktion behalten, was nat\u00fcrlich auch bedeutet, dass ein anderer Wirtschaftssektor \u2013 entweder Unternehmen oder der Staat \u2013 Abstriche machen muss. Da Unternehmen in China ungef\u00e4hr den gleichen Anteil am BIP bestreiten wie in anderen L\u00e4ndern, kommt dieser Sektor schon mal nicht in Frage. Die einzige M\u00f6glichkeit, den Konsum in China nachhaltig anzuheben, erfordert erhebliche Transfers von den lokalen Regierungen an die Haushalte.Und genau dies ist der Grund, warum es f\u00fcr Peking so schwierig ist diese Neubalancierung umzusetzen. Selbst 15 Jahre nachdem der damalige Premier Wen Jiabao \u6e29\u5bb6\u5b9d erstmals diesbez\u00fcgliche Versprechungen gemacht hatte, ist der Konsumanteil am BIP nur um wenige Prozentpunkte gestiegen. Der f\u00fcr einen Transfer von 10 bis 20 Prozentpunkten des BIP hin zu privaten Haushalten notwendige Machtverlust auf Kosten der lokalen Regierungen ist eine gewaltige Herausforderung. Wird sich Xi Jinping das trauen? Wir werden abwarten m\u00fcssen."

            "description": "By Casey HallSHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese consumers are typically known for lavish spending on high-end handbags, clothes and accessories that sustain Western luxury brands.This year, however, economic ill winds have sapped much of their urge to splurge and it's the littler luxuries in life - artisanal food and drinks as well as smart trendy appliances - that have caught their eye.Brands that have jumped on the trend include Kweichow Moutai, best known for $300 bottles of baijiu, the Chinese spirit popular at banquets. It debuted baijiu-infused ice cream at $10 a cup in May, racking up 2.5 million yuan ($350,000) of sales on the first day.Hong Kong-listed Budweiser Brewing Asia-Pacific, a unit of Anheuser-Busch InBev, notes that premium and craft beer as well as specially packaged gift boxes of beer priced at hundreds of dollars are selling unexpectedly well.Sales of gaming gear and home devices from water-saving shower heads to smart toothbrushes to printers surged as much as four times last year's levels during JD.com's mid-year 618 shopping festival, data from the e-commerce giant showed.Chinese consumers are \"spoiling themselves with those little things and they're loving something novel,\" said Mark Tanner, founder of marketing agency China Skinny.The shift in consumer trends, one that has seen some segments of the population go ultra-frugal, comes amid much economic gloom.The country's COVID-zero policy and its resulting frequent lockdowns have put the brakes on business activity and normal outlets for spending such as tourism. The property sector is also in crisis while the tech and private tutoring industries have sharply reined in hiring after regulatory crackdowns, contributing to a spike in youth unemployment.The economy narrowly escaped contraction in the second quarter and retail sales grew a measly 0.5% in January to August from the same period a year earlier, a far cry from growth of around 8% to 9% seen in recent years.Story continuesWestern luxury brands, in particular, are hurting. Burberry Group and French conglomerate Kering, which houses brands such as Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, both reported 35% year-on-year declines for China sales in the April-June quarter.Lucy Lu, a 31-year-old Shanghai resident who works in marketing for a domestic fashion brand, says she is one of many consumers mending her ways.\"Before, let's say with a handbag or cosmetics, if I liked it I would just buy it without a second thought, now I really double check with myself if I need something before I buy it.\"\"Dining out is now my main treat,\" Lu added.For some artisanal food and drink sellers, this new shift in consumer behaviour represents a perfect moment to expand.Gerard Low, founder of Shanghai-based ice cream brand Dal Cuore where a scoop costs about 40 yuan ($5.60), plans to open a fifth store in the mega-city, encouraged by the quick return of footfall to normal levels after a draconian two-month lockdown was lifted earlier this year.He also notes that more families, instead of mostly young people, are heading to his shops for a treat.\"When times aren't so good, people want to feel better, guilty pleasures like ice cream can help,\" said Low.($1 = 7.1584 Chinese yuan)(Reporting by Casey Hall; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)",

Experts said that consumption will continue to rebound during the rest of the year, given favorable factors such as continuous growth in income.For instance, Kweichow Moutai's preliminary calculations showed that its total revenue reached about 89.79 billion yuan ($12.49 billion) between January and September, up 16.5 percent year-on-year. Its profit grew around 19.1 percent to about 44.4 billion yuan.Another leading baijiu maker, Shanxi Xinghuacun Fenjiu Group, said on the same day that its profit reached 7 billion yuan in the first three quarters, up 42 percent year-on-year, thanks to a significant revenue increase from high-end products.As an important indicator of domestic consumption, the rosy liquor industry underscores the stabilization of the country's consumption sector, said analysts.Despite COVID-19 resurgences in some regions, consumption has shown resilience. Retail sales reached 3.63 trillion yuan in August , up 5.4 percent year-on-year, accelerating 2.7 percentage points compared from July, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data showed.The NBS is set to announce the retail sales figure for September on Tuesday.Analysts with China International Capital Corp, a major investment bank, said in a note posted on its WeChat account that consumption will continue to rebound in the second half of the year, with a marked improvement expected after August due to lower base figures last year.They said that favorable factors including continuous growth in workers' per capita income, consumption upgrading as well as opportunities in lower-tier cities will inject momentum for the sustainable development of retail consumption.\"Retail sales are expected to post up to 8 percent year-on-year growth during the fourth quarter, a peak shopping season when residents step up spending to make preparations for the New Year holiday and Chinese Spring Festival,\" Dong Dengxin, director of the Finance and Securities Institute of the Wuhan University of Science and Technology, told the Global Times on Thursday.He voiced confidence that consumption is able to maintain stable growth and the country's overall economic growth will stabilize later this year.The authorities stressed stimulating market demand to fire up economic recovery by various means. A State Council executive meeting on September 21 reiterated that policy measures to boost investment and consumption will be advanced on a priority basis, including fiscal and financial support for key infrastructure projects throughout the country.Local governments have also ramped up efforts to stabilize demand for a recovery. Over 20 Chinese cities have released a total of about 4 billion yuan worth of consumption vouchers , with more expected in the fourth quarter to ramp up consumption.",

Both are represented by DVP, one of France\u2019s biggest sourcing and marketing companies representing over 250 estates in five major French wine regions and bought by Badet Cl\u00e9ment in 2003.\u201cWe believe that this collaboration between Sam\u2019s Club and DVP will create great synergies. It will allow a broader population of Chinese consumers to discover a wider range of Burgundy estates wines with great price quality value ratio from Cote de Nuits, Cote de Beaune and Cote Chalonnaise,\u201d says Olivier Hui-Bon-Hoa, Regional Director of Asia at Badet Cl\u00e9ment.\u201cThis is made possible by combining the sourcing abilities of DVP as one of the French leading specialist in the distribution and marketing of estates wines (over 250 estates including around 150 from Bourgogne alone) together with Sam\u2019s Club retailing ability to reach for their members and consumers anywhere in mainland China. Two wines estates are now already available but several more estates will made their way to China soon.\u201dClos Saint LouisLocated 300 meters above sea level inside a 12th century church, Clos Saint Louis winery includes an old vigneron\u2019s house built in 1634 and a hunting lodge that dates back to 1703, to which 12 hectares of vines are situated on several parcels in the hamlet of Fixey.For decades, the estate has been run by the Bernards, an old Burgundian family, where many have served as majors of Dijion and most recently Charles Bernard was the mayor of Fixin. Today, the estate is run by his son, Philippe, who took over the domaine in 1995.Its flagship wine is made from a 3.5ha monopoly and both 2017 and 2018 vintages have become available through Sam\u2019s Club, which boasts 4 million paid members across China in 36 of its stores across 23 cities.Maison R\u00e9mi SeguinAnother estate from Cote de Nuits that has been taken up by Sam\u2019s Club is Maison R\u00e9mi Seguin in Morey-Saint-Denis. Its vineyard contains several prestigious parcels and Climats in Gevrey Chambertin, Morey-Saint-Denis and Chambolle-Musigny.In 2011, the whole estate was acquired by the well-known Burgundian winemaker Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Magnien, one of the shrewdest and sharpest winemakers working in the C\u00f4te d\u2019Or today. Following this acquisition, Magnien set up a business under Maison Remi Seguin beside the one he already operates under Maison Frederic Magnien and the renowned Domaine Michel Magnien.The Magnien\u2019s Family is a key actor in the wine culture of C\u00f4te d\u2019Or. The Michel Magnien estate and the Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Magnien house work naturally, without pesticides or herbicides, by enhancing the natural environment of the soil and the vine guided by the philosophy of biodynamics, in particular by strengthening the vitality and resistance of the plant.In line with its biodynamic winemaking philosophy, R\u00e9mi Seguin is also embracing a bio-lunar oriented philosophy. Two of its wines Marsannay and Gevery Chambertin will be distributed by Walmart\u2019s Sam\u2019s Club in China.Like this: Like Loading...",

The Luxembourg team, consisting of Zaiah Amann, Herv\u00e9 Amann, Guy Bosseler and Jules Hoffelt, under the guidance of coach Daniel Poos, only took the lead with the 10th wine.Celebrating the country\u2019s first ever win in the competition, with 139 points, the team told organisers La Revue du Vin de France: \u201cIt\u2019s perseverance that allowed us to win.\u201dPortugal came second with 123 points, narrowly slipping past Iberian neighbours Spain who gained 122. Hungary (who were last year\u2019s winning team), England and Belgium came in joint fourth with 117 points apiece.Perhaps slightly surprisingly, France, on home turf (as usual for the competition) and (unknowingly) faced with five French wines, came 18th. Brazil was in last, with 37 points.Team Kenya, who made history as the first all-female team in the competition\u2019s history, came 26th. In an Instagram post, the team said: \u201cA huge, huge thank you for all the support and to everyone who took the time to watch us live, tunawapenda sana [which means \u201cI love you all so much\u201d in Swahili]! We are very proud of ourselves!\u201dTeam Zimbabwe, the subject of the recently-released feature-length documentary Blind Ambition (reviewed by db here) were 20th.

            "description": "And for the more than 20 million people who live in or visit Beijing, the capital city, there is one additional worry: a pop-up window that can randomly show up on your phone to disrupt all your plans.Starting in 2020, China rolled out a contact tracing program that assigns a QR code to everyone in the country. It shows your covid status and allows you to enter public venues or take public transportation. Part of China\u2019s stringent zero-covid policy, the system has persisted, and some of the once-lauded features that kept deaths comparatively low in the country now feel more burdensome than beneficial to its citizens. (Most covid apps in other countries have been suspended. We documented all of them back in 2020.)The pop-up, \u5f39\u7a97, is one additional complicated layer that Beijing added to its tracing system. This window in the mobile covid app won\u2019t go away unless the user immediately takes a PCR test. It gives broad instructions on what to do under the title \u201cfriendly reminders,\u201d but it\u2019s not so friendly. It masks a user\u2019s QR code so that it can\u2019t be scanned, thus denying people access to just about everywhere in China. In some cases, it takes only a day to get a PCR test to make the window go away; other times, people may be asked to quarantine at home for seven days or more.I have friends scattered around all parts of China, and this year I\u2019ve seen so many of them complaining about it. \u201cI went to take a PCR test to solve the pop-up window problem, but the testing location turned out to be a high-risk zone, so I was asked to quarantine at home for 14 days,\u201d wrote a friend in April. The specifics may differ, but they all agree on the particular menace: no one knows why they are receiving the pop-up window or when they will get it, and there\u2019s no way to prepare for it.Officially, the municipal government of Beijing says there are several reasons why people get a pop-up window: you have been to a city with recent covid cases; you have just been abroad; you have been in the same \u201ctime and space\u201d with someone exposed to covid; or you didn\u2019t get a PCR test within 72 hours of buying fever or cough medicine.But the problem is, despite being touted as a high-tech pandemic solution, the app\u2019s risk-identifying mechanism tends to cast a wider-than-necessary net, with zero explanation as to why the pop-up is appearing\u2014which often leaves people confused and stuck in covid limbo.That\u2019s what happened to Flora Yuan, a 28-year-old Beijing resident. She received the pop-up window for the first time earlier this year when she was walking outside her office building; she was immediately blocked from reentering. \u201cAfter the pop-up window, you could still walk around on the street, but you\u2019d need a QR code to go into any place, a park, a restaurant, or a shop,\u201d she told me recently.",

Apr\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re baisse de son chiffre d\u2019affaires depuis au moins 2004, en ao\u00fbt, l\u2019entreprise chinoise vient, pr\u00e8s de deux mois plus tard, de quitter le fauteuil de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 chinoise la plus valoris\u00e9e.De l\u2019alcool et des jeuxC\u2019est Kweichow Moutai, un g\u00e9ant de l\u2019alcool, qui b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie de la chute du g\u00e9ant du jeu vid\u00e9o et des r\u00e9seaux sociaux. La valorisation de ce fournisseur de Baijiu, une liqueur pris\u00e9e lors des grandes occasions, d\u00e9passe de plus de 5,4 milliards de dollars le champion d\u00e9chu.Inscrivez-vous \u00e0 la newsletter En vous inscrivant vous acceptez notre politique de protection des donn\u00e9es personnelles.Cette course \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re place, anecdotique en soi, a le m\u00e9rite de mettre en \u00e9vidence les difficult\u00e9s de Tencent. Sa valeur atteignait des sommets in\u00e9dits en janvier 2021, mais elle a perdu depuis pr\u00e8s de 64 % \u00e0 la bourse de Hong Kong, soit une chute de valorisation de 623 milliards de dollars.Les raisons de ce d\u00e9clin sont multiples. En premier lieu, \u00e0 partir de fin 2020, P\u00e9kin a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de mettre une pression r\u00e9glementaire de tous les instants sur ses g\u00e9ants du num\u00e9rique.Pour Tencent cela se manifeste par la limitation du temps de jeu vid\u00e9o des mineurs, l\u2019interdiction de sortir de nouveaux jeux, l\u2019ouverture \u00e0 la concurrence de ses services, la suspension de son r\u00e9seau social WeChat durant quelques mois, la musique, le streaming, l\u2019\u00e9ducation\u2026Les chutes en bourse de Tencent se sont succ\u00e9d\u00e9 aux rythmes des nouvelles r\u00e9glementations. Si depuis, le pouvoir a l\u00e9g\u00e8rement rel\u00e2ch\u00e9 la pression, la situation de l\u2019entreprise reste fragile.Tencent souffre \u00e9galement du contexte plus global. La politique \u00ab Z\u00e9ro Covid \u00bb de P\u00e9kin, et ses multiples confinements localis\u00e9s, nuit aux revenus publicitaires et aux paiements commerciaux, deux activit\u00e9s importantes pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Par ailleurs, comme aux \u00c9tats-Unis, l\u2019\u00e9conomie est dans une dynamique inqui\u00e9tante dont les g\u00e9ants du num\u00e9rique p\u00e2tissent particuli\u00e8rement.Tencent traverse une mauvaise passe, mais se maintient au sommetPour endiguer cette situation, Tencent a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de vendre certains de ses actifs, d\u2019abandonner des activit\u00e9s jug\u00e9es non essentielles et de r\u00e9duire ses d\u00e9penses. Manifestement insuffisant, car selon un rapport de la banque Morgan Stanley, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par Bloomberg, les difficult\u00e9s persistent aux yeux des actionnaires.La banque estime que, depuis le d\u00e9but de l\u2019ann\u00e9e, 30 milliards de dollars d\u2019actions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vendus. Bien plus que les autres soci\u00e9t\u00e9s chinoises comparables, le rythme aurait m\u00eame tendance \u00e0 s\u2019acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer. M\u00eame les actionnaires majoritaires vendent.Tencent est loin de la faillite. Il convient de ne pas oublier que son chiffre d\u2019affaires, d\u00e9cevant, du second trimestre, est tout de m\u00eame proche des 20 milliards de dollars. Avec la stabilisation de la pression r\u00e9glementaire, l\u2019entreprise pourrait facilement sortir de cette mauvaise passe et reprendre sa place de leader des groupes chinois.",

            "description": "Just a decade ago, asking for baijiu at a bar would likely lead to confused looks. But American bars are embracing the ancient Chinese grain spirit that was once considered too funky, too pungent, or otherwise too difficult to work with. Today, baijiu has found its way into everything from Jell-O shots to Daiquiris.Although it\u2019s known primarily as a funky spirit, baijiu is also expansive and varied, coming a long way from its origins as a spirit solely served neat. \u201cBaijiu completely shook up my preconceived notions of spirits, where every spirit in the same category tastes somewhat similar to each other,\u201d says Nick Lappen of Boston\u2019s Backbar, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t apply to baijiu.\u201dThe production of the spirit involves inoculating cooked grains such as sorghum and barley with a culture of mold, yeast and bacteria called qu. Through a process of parallel fermentation, the qu simultaneously breaks starches down into sugars and converts sugars into alcohol. Each distillery has a different recipe for qu, which can lend baijiu floral, spicy, nutty or umami flavor. Based on these characteristics, baijiu is classified by the Chinese government into four primary categories, called \u201caromas\u201d: light, rice, strong and sauce (a descriptor referring to the umami flavor of soy sauce).Until recently, consumers in China rarely considered baijiu a cocktail ingredient. Instead, for thousands of years, the clear liquor, served neat, has accompanied food. But stateside, baijiu has ridden the waves of the craft cocktail revival, thanks to scholarly work by early adopters like Derek Sandhaus, whose books helped demystify the spirit and articulate the nuances of its various aroma styles, inspiring a range of new cocktails.Much like the different styles of rum, baijius from different categories aren\u2019t always interchangeable. For example, light-aroma baijiu is grassy and sometimes smoky, and works particularly well with herbal flavors or paired with mezcal, as Katie Weismann demonstrates in her Season of Strangers. The bartender at Spoke Wine Bar in Somerville, Massachusetts, builds the drink around Er Guo Tou, a twice-distilled light-aroma baijiu, and echoes the spirit\u2019s earthiness by infusing it with fennel. To complement this base, Weismann reaches for a similarly smoky mezcal, while acid-adjusted watermelon juice balances the drink, giving it a refreshing quality.Rice-aroma baijiu, meanwhile, has a mild flavor, similar to vodka. Lappen of Backbar (which hosts a baijiu pop-up) contrasts the spirit\u2019s subtly sweet quality with fish sauce, five-spice bitters and mole bitters in his Golden Years, which is inspired by pork ribs with fish sauce caramel glaze, a dish he first tasted in Vietnam. The drink uses Vinn, a domestically produced rice-aroma baijiu from Oregon, and adds a touch of maple syrup in a nod to Lappen\u2019s New England roots. The cocktail is a testament to the way rice-aroma baijiu, like vodka, can provide a simple base for more saturated flavors to shine.",

            "description": "NewsBy Jessica MasonEdinburgh-based brewer Vault City has launched new low-alcohol sour beer to celebrate International Sour Beer Day today.The new 2.5% ABV sour beer, named Tahiti Treat, is a collaboration with \u2018low & no\u2019 experts Mash Gang and has been flavoured with mango, pineapple, lime, and rum.Speaking to the drinks business, Vault City Brewing co-founder Steven Smith Hay said: \u201cThis International Sour Beer Day we\u2019re launching our first ever low alcohol Vault City sour beer. We\u2019re known for high ABV, or high \u2018vault-age\u2019 beers as we call them, and these are typically enjoyed as a treat alongside more traditional beer styles. However, what we\u2019re seeing more and more is a demand for sessionable sour beer, from people who will happily sip sours all night \u2013 and Tahiti Treat is the perfect beer to do just that.\u201dVault City, which has listings in more than 200 independent bars across the UK, as well as supermarket giants Morrisons and Tesco, has created the Tahiti Treat beer in what it calls a response to a shift in consumer perception of sour beer.Tahiti Treat will also be joined by four new flavours to mark International Sour Beer Day including Dark Fruits Cookie Dough Dreamcake (8.5% ABV); Pineapple Habanero (7.5% ABV); and Lychee & Ginger Session Sour with Lemongrass & Coconut (4.7% ABV).Smith Hay declared: \u201cWe\u2019re the biggest sour beer producer in the UK, and now post-Covid, we\u2019re starting to see growth at an international level, exporting regularly to over 20 different countries and collaborating with breweries like Amundsden in Norway, and Browar Stu Mosto in Poland, with plenty more in the pipeline.\u201dThe Edinburgh-based brewer has already produced more than 45 new beers in 2022 alone, including Triple Fruited Mango and Blueberry Maple, which are the first and third best-selling lines in Tesco\u2019s 440ml craft beer category; and Vault City also recently collaborated with comedian and broadcaster Ed Gamble to launch Canned Laughter, an Apple and Guava Session Sour with 20% of sales donated to Campaign Against Living Miserably.Smith Hay told db: \u201cPeople laughed when we said we were starting a sour only brewery back in 2018 but now more and more breweries are trying their hand at sour beer. Traditional sours can be an acquired taste, and often seen as a niche within the industry \u2013 the end of someone\u2019s craft beer journey. We saw an opportunity for modern sour beer, through mixed fermentation and obscene amounts of real fruit, creating a more accessible drink and for many, a gateway into craft beer.\u201dVault City turned over \u00a32.4million in the last financial year, and has grown to a team of 25 across its brewery, office, bar and taproom divisions. The brewery unveils a trio of experimental beers every three weeks and also received national attention after becoming the first UK brewer to formally adopt a four-day working week in January this year.",

            "description": "von Bloomberg News In China erfreuen sich ESG-Fonds wachsender Popularit\u00e4t. Doch die Kriterien daf\u00fcr legt die Kommunistische Partei fest. Und so investieren die Fonds auch in Kohlefirmen und Unternehmen, denen Menschenrechtsverletzungen vorgeworfen werdenIn einem 40-min\u00fctigen Livestream im Juni wandte sich Fondsmanagerin Hou Chunyan direkt an die wachsende Zahl der chinesischen Privatanleger. Ihre Botschaft: ESG-Anlagen sind auf einzigartige Weise mit Pekings zunehmenden Anstrengungen vereinbar, CO2-Neutralit\u00e4t zu erreichen und den \u201eallgemeinen Wohlstand\u201d zu f\u00f6rdern.Der von ihr verwaltete Da Cheng ESG Responsibility Investment Mixed Fund schlie\u00dft allerdings Kohlefirmen und Spirituosenhersteller nicht aus. Der CSI 300 ESG Leaders Index l\u00e4sst auch Chemiekonzerne zu. Solar- und Technologieunternehmen, denen der Einsatz von Zwangsarbeit vorgeworfen wird, sind in Chinas wichtigster ESG-Benchmark ebenfalls erlaubt.Null-Emissionen und die Bek\u00e4mpfung der Armut sind unter Pr\u00e4sident Xi Jinping Staatsziele der Volksrepublik. Daher trifft das Thema auf fruchtbaren Boden. \u201eNachhaltige\u201d und \u201egr\u00fcne\u201d Fonds schie\u00dfen wie Pilze aus dem Boden. Nach Bloomberg-Daten wurden in den vergangenen 20 Monaten mindestens 112 solcher Fonds neu aufgelegt dreimal mehr als in den vier Jahren davor. Bei gr\u00fcnen Anleihen ist China bereits einer der gr\u00f6\u00dften Emittenten.Laut einer Umfrage von Fidelity International haben Privatanleger in China mehr Appetit auf ESG-Fonds als in anderen gro\u00dfen asiatischen M\u00e4rkten. Das im Segment verwaltete Verm\u00f6gen hat sich seit Anfang 2021 auf rund 50 Mrd. Dollar verdoppelt.Politische Priorit\u00e4ten bestimmen ESG-DefinitionWas chinesische Verm\u00f6gensverwalter als \u201eESG\u201d definieren, orientiert sich dabei eng an den politischen Priorit\u00e4ten Pekings: dem Netto-Null-Ziel f\u00fcr das Jahr 2060 sowie den Themen Energiesicherheit, Besch\u00e4ftigung auf dem Land und Armutsbek\u00e4mpfung.Allerdings sind von den mehr als 170 in China ans\u00e4ssigen ESG-Fonds laut Bloomberg-Daten etwa 15 Prozent in Kohleunternehmen investiert, die in China die mit Abstand gr\u00f6\u00dfte Quelle von Treibhausgasemissionen darstellen. Mehr als 60 Prozent halten Beteiligungen in der Stahlindustrie, einem der ganz gro\u00dfen Kohleverbraucher.\u201eDie Leute sagen ESG, als ob wir uns darauf geeinigt h\u00e4tten, was es ist \u2013 das haben wir aber nicht\u201d, erkl\u00e4rt Bradford Cornell, emeritierter Professor f\u00fcr Finanzwirtschaft an der University of California, der vor kurzem eine Arbeit \u00fcber ESG-Investments in China geschrieben hat. \u201eIn China werden die Regeln f\u00fcr Umwelt- und Sozialfragen von der Kommunistischen Partei Chinas festgelegt.\u201dChinas Ansatz demonstriert die universelle Anziehungskraft des ESG-Prinzips, wonach Unternehmen, die Umweltkosten und soziale Risiken ber\u00fccksichtigen, langfristig h\u00f6here Renditen erzielen. Er zeigt aber auch, dass es viel Spielraum bei den anzuwendenden Kriterien gibt \u2013 und dass diese durchaus im Widerspruch zueinanderstehen k\u00f6nnen.\u201eEin einheimischer Analyst w\u00fcrde Staatsunternehmen f\u00fcr eine gute Sache halten, w\u00e4hrend sein Kollege in Europa das als Ausschlusskriterium sehen k\u00f6nnte\u201d, sagt Liu Xiangfeng, dessen in Peking ans\u00e4ssige Firma QuantData auf ESG-Analysen spezialisiert ist. \u201eDa sind Kultur und Ideologie im Spiel.\u201dAuch Spirituosenhersteller sind ESG-konformEin Beispiel daf\u00fcr ist Kweichow Moutai. Der chinesische Schnapsproduzent h\u00e4lt dank seiner Initiativen f\u00fcr Besch\u00e4ftigung auf dem Land eine der Spitzenpositionen im CSI 300 ESG Leaders Index, der die 100 in Schanghai und Shenzhen notierten Unternehmen mit den h\u00f6chsten ESG-Ratings abbildet. Der Konzern China Shenhua Energy, der 78 Prozent seines Umsatzes aus dem Kohlebergbau erzielt, ist eine weitere Top-Holding.Etwa zehn Prozent der chinesischen ESG-Fonds halten auch Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology. Dem Spezialisten f\u00fcr \u00dcberwachungstechnologie werden von den USA Menschenrechtsverletzungen gegen muslimische Minderheiten in der Region Xinjiang vorgeworfen. Daher hat Washington das Unternehmen auf seine Sanktionsliste gesetzt. Hangzhou Hikvision bestreitet den Vorwurf.In Deutschland ist die DWS Group wegen des Vorwurfs des Greenwashing in die Schlagzeilen geraten. Angesichts von Ermittlungen der Staatsanwaltschaft war der ehemalige Chef der Fondstochter der Deutschen Bank, Asoka W\u00f6hrmann, zur\u00fcckgetreten.Mehr Artikel wie diesen finden Sie auf bloomberg.com\u00a92022 Bloomberg L.P."

            "description": "(Yicai Global) Aug. 26 -- Following the success of Kweichow Moutai\u2019s recent boozy ice-cream offerings, the Chinese distiller has branched into mooncakes, a traditional Chinese pastry eaten during the Mid-Autumn Festival. Its gift sets, which sold out nearly two months ago, are now fetching high prices on the resale market.A set of Kweichow Moutai\u2019s mooncakes, which do not contain any of its famous baijiu liquor, was reselling for as much as CNY698 (USD101). This is a huge mark-up from the original prices of CNY188 (USD27) and CNY318 a set.Buyers should boycott mooncakes sold at such extortionate prices, distributor Moutai International Hotel said on its WeChat account on Aug. 24. Around 100,000 sets of mooncakes made by Guangdong Rimei Food and retailed through Kweichow Moutai\u2019s hotel arm had sold out by July 1.The Moutai brand has become a symbol of high-end luxury and so the Zunyi, southwestern Guizhou province-based firm will make great efforts to develop more sideline products, Zhu Danpeng, deputy director of Guangdong Food Safety Promotion Association, told Yicai Global.Mooncakes are big business at this time of the year as they are a very popular gift during the Mid-Autumn Festival, which falls on Sept. 10 this year and marks a time of family reunion. They cost very little to make but can command a high profit margin of as much as 60 percent.Guangzhou Restaurant, for instance, has a profit margin of 60 percent on some of its mooncakes and its revenue from mooncake sales has been rising year by year, Yicai Global learned from looking at the pastry makers annual reports.Chinese bakery Ganso earned CNY1.5 billion (USD218.8 million) through the sales of Chinese and Western cake and pastry gift sets last year with a gross profit margin of 51.5 percent, according to its 2021 financial report.Editors: Shi Yi, Kim Taylor",

Retail giant Alibaba and liquor maker Kweichow Moutai ranked second and third, registering brand values of 137 billion dollars and 108.5 billion dollars, respectively.Among this year\u2019s highest-ranking newcomers, lifestyle-focused social media platform Xiaohongshu, with a brand value of 6.6 billion dollars, ranked 37th, while the intelligent speech and AI technologies company iFLYTEK reaped 4.2 billion dollars in brand value and secured 53rd spot on the top 100 chart.The level of awareness of Chinese brands in the overseas market has significantly increased over the past year, the report noted. Overall, overseas operations amounted to about 8.8 percent of the business of the top 100 Chinese brands.Strong brands have the potential to effectively absorb the impact of difficult economic times, Doreen Wang, CEO of Kantar Greater China said, suggesting that Chinese brands embrace the concept of sustainable development while enhancing full-chain innovation capability.",

The products included a blend of Zhongxuegao\u2019s almond and yogurt-flavored ice cream with cold-brew coffee, while others added Japanese probiotic milk beverage Yakult or jasmine green tea.Adding ice cream to coffee has become increasingly popular in China.

            "description": "NewsBy Alice LiangChinese baijiu liquor brand Moutai Bulao has launched an international marketing campaign by introducing a new concept named the \u201cTasting Era\u201d to shape accessible and delightful baijiu experiences for new consumers with Chinese food pairings.Typically distilled from fermented sorghum and rice, Kweichow Moutai Bulao is the first in the liquor portfolio to include longan, wolfberry, hawthorn, and Angelica dahurica in its ingredients to give the baijiu a smoother taste. Furthermore, it goes all out with a 1000-year-old traditional brewing technique, which producing one batch of Moutai Bulao takes a minimum of three to five years.Specially designed for overseas markets, Moutai Bulao comes in a smaller volume of 125ml to encourage trial among people who are new to the liquor. It also comes in a 4-bottle bundle which makes a great gift.To support \u201cTasting Era\u201d, a marketing initiative to promote Moutai Bulao with Chinese food pairing, a smart liquor experience machine is designed to retail Moutai Bulao in a new volume \u2013 5 ml shots \u2013 via a network of F&B and lifestyle establishments.The grand launch of the worldwide \u201cTasting Era\u201d campaign was kicked off in Singapore last month, where around 350 guests were treated to a sumptuous dinner.In Hong Kong, the first phase of the \u201cTasting Era\u201d, MTBL is targeting to deploy 200 units of its latest smart liquor machines across Hong Kong. The brand is also offering a special, limited-time treat for Hong Kong consumers by giving away 8,000 Moutai Bulao shots, which can be redeemed at F&B and lifestyle establishments via the Chang Chang app.By incoperating technology, customers\u2019 needs can be better managed by relying on digital network infrastructure, large-scale data collection and analysis, and a network of smart liquor experience machines.\u201cBaijiu is experiencing rapidly rising demand overseas and there is tremendous potential for growth. But beyond its novelty, baijiu is also rooted in centuries of culture and tradition \u2013 it is the spirit that binds and encourages social interconnectivity, perfect for large gatherings at banquet tables over a multi-course meal. By launching the latest generation of our smart machines at restaurants worldwide, our impetus is for consumers to be acquainted and immersed into the world of baijiu as authentically as possible \u2013 through a shared celebration of food and drinks,\u201d said Mr. Joe Sun, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ascent Bridge, the Group that owns MTBL.According to the brand, Moutai Bulao goes well with Western meaty and seafood dishes, as well as grilled Korean foods, caviar and Japanese sashimi. It also shows great potential in cocktails. This presents a great opportunity for the liquor to appeal younger audiences.MTBL also plans to set up 16 Cultural Centres around the world. Visitors can expect interactive cultural exhibitions and liquor tasting spaces where they can learn more about the unique distillation and fermentation processes involved in making baijiu and Moutai Bulao through an immersive VR experience. In 2019, the first overseas MTBL Cultural Centre has already opened in Singapore.",

            "description": "NewsBy Christian SmithA Chinese heavyweight solidifies its place at the top of the pile in this list of the 10 most valuable spirits brands in the world, but some huge names miss out altogether.According to a new report from business valuation consultancy, Brand Finance, Asian brands dominate the top 10 most valuable spirits brands in the world, with heavyweight Baiju producer Kweichow Moutai sitting pretty in first place.Despite the Chinese brand falling in value by 5% according to the Brand Finance report, it retains a value of US$42.9 billion.Indeed, the company recently forecast a 20% leap in profits for the first six months of this year compared with the same period in 2021, defying fears about Chinese consumer spending.The report uses a methodology whereby it assesses the total numeric economic benefit of a brand\u2019s license as Brand Finance calculates it.LVMH-owned Cognac giant Hennessy is the first brand outside of Asia to make the list, with a brand value of $5.2 billion.Hennessy recently came out on top of a list that calculated the most popular spirits brands on the internet. The Cognac producer has partnered to become the official spirit of the NBA and WNBA, and is ably abetted by its frequent mentions in popular culture, not least its profligate presence in rap lyrics.Bacardi, Jack Daniel\u2019s and Johnnie Walker also made the top 10 most valuable spirits brands on the internet list.Here is the top 10 in full (values indicated in USD):Kweichow Moutai $42.9 billion Wuliangye $28.7 billion Luzhou Laojiao $7.3 billion Yanghe $6.4 billion Hennessey $5.2 billion Shanxi Xinghuacun Fen Wine $5.0 billion Bacardi $3.1 billion Gujing Gong Jiu $3.1 billion Jack Daniel\u2019s $2.9 billion Johnnie Walker $2.6 billionRead more: The 10 most valuable drinks companies in the world (2022)",

Le groupe produit et commercialise \u00e9galement de la bi\u00e8re et du vin.Son portefeuille de marques comprend le scotch Johnnie Walker, la vodka Smirnoff, le whisky canadien Crown Royal, le rhum Captain Morgan, le gin Tanqueray, la cr\u00e8me irlandaise Baileys et la bi\u00e8re Guinness.Diageo d\u00e9tient \u00e9galement 34% du fabricant de champagne et de cognac haut de gamme Moet Hennessy, une filiale du fabricant fran\u00e7ais de produits de luxe LVMH (\u00ab Wide Moat \u00bb) et une participation de pr\u00e8s de 55% dans United Spirits en Inde.Une strat\u00e9gie centr\u00e9e sur les acquistionsLes fusions et acquisitions font toujours partie de l'ADN de l'entreprise, et les transactions pass\u00e9es ont fait de Diageo un leader mondial de l'industrie.Bien que le march\u00e9 des boissons alcoolis\u00e9es soit assez concentr\u00e9e, nous pensons qu'il y a encore un potentiel de consolidation.En dehors des cinq premi\u00e8res entreprises, l'industrie est tr\u00e8s fragment\u00e9e et les acteurs r\u00e9gionaux dominent souvent dans les cat\u00e9gories de produits de niche ou les march\u00e9s locaux.Ces entreprises pr\u00e9sentent une nouvelle vague d'opportunit\u00e9s de fusion pour les groupes du secteur, dont Diageo, afin de renforcer leur pr\u00e9sence sur les march\u00e9s en d\u00e9veloppement.Une autre raison pour Diageo de continuer \u00e0 se consolider est d'\u00e9largir son portefeuille de produits, une strat\u00e9gie importante dans le commerce.Le volume dans l'industrie des spiritueux est assez stable (quoique plus cyclique que la bi\u00e8re), mais les tendances sont transitoires.Par exemple, le passage actuel des spiritueux blancs (principalement de la vodka) aux spiritueux bruns est un renversement de la tendance des ann\u00e9es 1990.La large pr\u00e9sence de Diageo dans toutes les cat\u00e9gories avec des marques de niche strat\u00e9giques mondiales et locales att\u00e9nue une partie du risque de volume li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9volution des go\u00fbts et des pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences des consommateurs.Premiumisation de l\u2019offreDiageo entreprend une strat\u00e9gie de premiumisation, qui est un soutien de long terme pour les volumes et le prix/mix.Aujourd'hui, sur les march\u00e9s matures, les spiritueux prennent le pas sur la bi\u00e8re et le vin \u00e0 mesure que les consommateurs montent en gamme.Tant au Royaume-Uni qu'aux \u00c9tats-Unis, la cat\u00e9gorie des spiritueux distill\u00e9s a gagn\u00e9 en part de march\u00e9 chaque ann\u00e9e au cours de la derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cennie; une poursuite de cette tendance pourrait soutenir le volume de Diageo sur les march\u00e9s d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s, malgr\u00e9 l\u2019effet d\u00e9favorable de la baisse de la consommation d'alcool.En ce qui concerne le rapport prix/mix, la fa\u00e7on dont Diageo a \u00e9chelonn\u00e9 la structure de prix de marques telles que Johnnie Walker d\u00e9montre qu'il existe des possibilit\u00e9s presque illimit\u00e9es de premiumisation de certaines des marques principales du portefeuille, un luxe que la plupart des entreprises de biens de consommation de base ne partagent pas.Rebond solide au second semestreDiageo a d\u00e9pass\u00e9 nos estimations pour l'ann\u00e9e compl\u00e8te au cours d'un impressionnant second semestre de l'exercice 2022, cl\u00f4turant une ann\u00e9e exceptionnelle pour le fabricant de spiritueux.La croissance organique consolid\u00e9e des ventes au second semestre de pr\u00e8s de 28 % d'une ann\u00e9e sur l'autre devrait figurer parmi les chiffres de croissance les plus importants au sein de notre univers de couverture.La dynamique commerciale est tr\u00e8s forte et Diageo est une couverture contre l'inflation plus s\u00fbre que la plupart de ses pairs, mais il semble probable que les conditions deviendront plus difficiles l'ann\u00e9e prochaine.La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 affiche une croissance annuelle tr\u00e8s solide de 21 % des revenus, \u00e0 15,5 milliards de livre sterling (GBP), tandis que son r\u00e9sultat op\u00e9rationnel a bondi de 26% hors effets de change \u00e0 4,41 milliards GBP.Juste valeur inchang\u00e9eNous avons l\u00e9g\u00e8rement abaiss\u00e9 nos estimations de croissance pour l'ann\u00e9e prochaine, mais nous conservons notre estimation de la juste valeur de 3.100 pence par action.Il y a eu des surprises positives dans toutes les r\u00e9gions, mais la croissance des volumes de 20 % sur l'ann\u00e9e compl\u00e8te et la croissance organique des revenus de 30 % en Europe ont \u00e9t\u00e9 notables car elles sont bien sup\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la tendance d\u2019avant COVID-19 dans la r\u00e9gion.La fin des mesures de distanciation sur de nombreux march\u00e9s a permis au commerce de rouvrir compl\u00e8tement, donnant un coup de pouce \u00e0 la fois au volume et au mix, et la tendance \u00e0 la premiumisation des spiritueux reprenant des parts \u00e0 la bi\u00e8re et de vin dont la consommation a battu son plein l'an dernier.Nous pensons que l'\u00e9volution favorable de la consommation ralentira l'ann\u00e9e prochaine \u00e0 mesure que les consommateurs s'adapteront un co\u00fbt de la vie plus \u00e9lev\u00e9.Diageo a actuellement beaucoup moins de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 compenser l'inflation des co\u00fbts que nombre de ses pairs.La combinaison favorable des consommateurs qui s'\u00e9changent et les larges marges brutes limitent les augmentations en pourcentage que Diageo doit subir en gros, tandis que le co\u00fbt d\u00e9clar\u00e9 des marchandises vendues dans des produits vieillis tels que Johnnie Walker, qui a augment\u00e9 \u00e0 deux chiffres l'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re, ne sera pas affect\u00e9 par l'inflation pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es.\u00a9 Morningstar, 2022 - L'information contenue dans ce document est \u00e0 vocation p\u00e9dagogique et fournie \u00e0 titre d'information UNIQUEMENT.

While much of this consumption has been driven domestically, baijiu has been gaining massive popularity all across the world, and the best drinking cities in the world - from London and New York to Singapore - are quickly embracing the potential in baijiu's fragrant aroma and complex flavour.Among the finest baijiu brands is Moutai, which continues to stand at the top of global consumer popularity, according to a 2021 report from valuation consultancy Brand Finance . As Moutai continues to gain momentum, the liquor brand Moutai Bulao is making its mark abroad by introducing its new concept, the \"Tasting Era\", which refers to innovative tasting experiences for consumers. Similar to how sake is synonymous with Japanese cuisine, the \"Tasting Era\" aims to shape accessible and delightful baijiu experiences for new consumers by introducing Moutai Bulao with Chinese food pairings. The grand launch of the \"Tasting Era\" was held in Singapore on 20 July, where around 350 guests were treated to a sumptuous dinner.Chinese Baijiu starts from Tasting EraTasting Era starts with Moutai BulaoMoutai Bulao starts with Chang ChangMoutai Bulao is exclusively distributed worldwide (excluding Mainland China) by MTBL Global Pte Ltd (MTBL), a fully-owned subsidiary of Ascent Bridge Limited(formally known as AEI Corporation Limited), and has been its key strategic brand and product since 2018. Specially designed for overseas markets, Moutai Bulao 125ml comes in a smaller volume meant to encourage trial among people who are new to the liquor. MTBL Global USA Inc, a fully-owned subsidiary of MTBL launched the product in the United States of America (USA) in 2021.Supporting the \"Tasting Era\" is MTBL's newly-launched 4th generation of smart liquor experience machines, which retails Moutai Bulao in a new volume \u2013 5 ml. Unlike traditional beverage supply and distribution channels, MTBL has leveraged technology to better manage supply to meet customers' needs by relying on digital network infrastructure, large-scale data collection and analysis, and a network of smart liquor experience machines.With its precision marketing technology and mobile app, Chang Chang, consumers are able to sample Moutai Bulao at participating restaurants. Moutai Bulao comes in a 3-bottle bundle which makes a great present for family, friends and business partners. The full baijiu experience comes to life when consumers combine their liquor shots with curated Chinese cuisine pairings - a culture that dates more than a thousand years back.\"Baijiu is experiencing rapidly rising demand overseas and there is tremendous potential for growth. But beyond its novelty, baijiu is also rooted in centuries of culture and tradition - it is the spirit that binds and encourages social interconnectivity, perfect for large gatherings at banquet tables over a multi-course meal. By launching the latest generation of our smart machines at restaurants worldwide, our impetus is for consumers to be acquainted and immersed into the world of baijiu as authentically as possible - through a shared celebration of food and drinks,\" said Mr. Joe Sun, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ascent Bridge, the Group that owns MTBL.Moutai Bulao is distilled from fermented sorghum and rice, and is the first product in its category to include longan, wolfberry, hawthorn, and Angelica dahurica - giving it a much smoother taste instead of a fiery mouthfeel. It is also one of the most valuable spirits worldwide as the alcohol is derived from a thousand-year-old traditional brewing technique which is one of the most complicated brewing processes in the liquor industry.With its strong alcohol content and long-lasting, prominent flavour, Moutai has often been a source of inspiration in the ever-evolving culinary art scene.

The ice cream, which contains about 2 percent Moutai spirit, should retail for CNY60 (USD8.90) apiece, according to publicly available information.The product has been a rip-roaring success for Kweichow Moutai, which is looking for new growth points. The upscale baijiu distiller wants to reach younger consumers with a product they like, a retail industry insider said. More than 27,000 sold for over CNY1.7 million (USD252,555) on June 29, per the distiller's statistics.But limited supply has created a sellers\u2019 market. Online agents began stocking up on the novel dairy item soon after it was launched in late May. Co-created with leading dairy producer Mengniu Dairy, Zunyi-based Kweichow Moutai has limited its release to just seven Chinese provinces.Market prices vary widely.

            "description": "Amid the sizzling temperatures across the country, a hot topic is storming China's social media. The hashtag \"xuegaocike\", which literally means ice cream assassin, has gone viral on the Twitter-like Weibo. It's used when a customer is caught off guard by expensive ice creams launched by unfamiliar brands.The phrase has gained over 100 million impressions on Weibo as of Wednesday with many expressing anger over unreasonable prices via sarcastic videos and images. \"Will yank my hand away from those beautiful packages. Miss the 5 yuan ($1) popsicles so much,\" reads one of the popular comments.Chicecream, Beijing, July 6, 2022./CFP Chicecream, Beijing, July 6, 2022./CFPIn recent years, new domestic brands have gradually entered the market, targeting the consumers who are willing to spend more on better products, and competing with traditional Western ice cream brands, such as Magnum and Haagen-Dazs. One of the most well-known new domestic brands among young generations is Chicecream, also known as Zhong Xue Gao. Most Chicecream popsicles cost about 20 yuan ($3), with the most expensive reaching nearly 70 yuan ($10). For comparison, the average price of one Haagen-Dazs product is about 35 yuan ($5). This U.S. company entered the Chinese market nearly 30 years ago and is still regarded as a luxury symbol.But controversy follows success. Videos showing a Chicecream popsicle not melting after an hour and staying solid even under a lighter fire triggered public anger on the Internet on Tuesday. The topic remained trending for a few days and gained over 1.1 billion impressions. Most of netizens claimed the products were overloaded with additives, which is opposite of the company's claim of natural ingredients. The company defended itself and said on Wednesday that its products were in line with national food safety regulations.Meanwhile, the debate turned its focus to the high prices of other ice creams. In the past two years, many companies have taken steps to get a piece of the high-end ice cream market. For example, China's spirits maker Kweichow Moutai launched ice cream with three flavors jointly with Chinese dairy giant Mengniu in May. The ice cream sold out online within an hour of its first launch. \"The price was hyped up to 250 yuan ($40) just for marketing,\" a Weibo user commented.However, one of the reasons behind the high price is the cost of ingredients. The price of milk and cream has surged by 80 percent from 2008 to 2020, according to iiMedia Research.Also, ice cream with fancy packaging, healthier tastes and fine nutrition is naturally more expensive.Analysts said that consumers are in fact not against the idea of luxury ice cream, but find the price unreasonable due to the quality concerns and feel being cheated. The consumers' complains are easy to understood, because one popsicle was just 0.5 yuan ($0.1) in the early 2000s. About 70 percent of consumers said they would accept an ice cream priced under 10 yuan ($1.5), according to the iiMedia Research.To quell consumers' anger, regulators have stepped in. Local authorities in many provinces said they went to the local shops to check the price tags on ice cream this week. Under new state rules effective on July 1, consumers can also file complaints to the market regulators if they think products do not match the price label or have no label.",

            "description": "Jing Daily\u2019s monthly Chinese Collabs column looks at the China-related collaborations and drops that are transforming the luxury landscape. From local fashion brands to C-beauty, virtual idols to NFTs, and KOLS to lifestyle and games, it offers a curated selection of what\u2019s dropping and the trends behind them.Premium cognac Hennessy announced an unusual hire recently: Chinese idol and K-pop group GOT7 member Jackson Wang. The gamble paid off, and the campaign video has earned almost 1 million views so far. Elsewhere, Italian house Gucci also ventured into the alcohol world with its first premixed cocktail, Elisir d\u2019Elicrisio.Big global drinks names are finding new ways to be relevant to the mainland\u2019s Gen Z market. For their homegrown counterparts, the same is true. A long queue formed in front of the Moutai stand at Guiyang\u2019s Mixc shopping mall on Sunday. What for? Moutai ice cream, China\u2019s first-ever tie-up between luxury liquor brand Kweichow Moutai \u8d35\u5dde\u8305\u53f0 and domestic milk outfit Mengniu Dairy.Although there are countless Gen Z and millennials who have turned their back on alcohol, innovative collaborations are rebranding its image for the demographic that enjoy drinking. In this month\u2019s column, Jing Daily explores the names currently bringing the market to life.Kweichow Moutai and others explore ice creamGen Z loves ice cream. The product offers companies a gateway to rejuvenate their image and connect with this audience. Data from the Prospective Industry research institute shows that China\u2019s ice cream sector reached $22 billion (147 billion RMB) in 2020 and exceeded $24 billion (160 billion RMB) in 2021, ranking first in the world in terms of market size.Moutai ice cream made quite the splash. Sales hit over $30,000 (200,000 RMB) within the first seven hours and on Weibo, the related hashtag had over 65 million views as fans cried out for scoops of \u201cdrunk\u201d ice cream. The collaboration earned $5,891,886 (39.4 million RMB) in media impact value according to software company Launchmetrics.It\u2019s not the first time a baijiu brand has partnered with an ice cream label, reminded Tom Griffiths, business director at the Saas data tool company EQI Data. Back in 2019, premium liquor maker Wuliangye \u4e94\u7cae\u6db2 worked with bubble tea chain Heytea; Luzhou wine cellar once co-branded with high-end ice pop Zhong Xuegao.However, Kweichow Moutai, the most valuable beverage group in the world, is a unique case. \u201cIt has built up such a specific culture around itself. The liquor is mainly consumed by business people with refined taste in their forties and over. Now, it is a challenge for it to get outside that circle,\u201d said Griffiths. Or the victim of its own success?Citing a Tmall report, Moonie Zhu, co-founder and managing director of eTOC GmbH, which helps international brands to sell and grow in China, confirmed that the value of low-alcohol fruit wine sales has grown by more than 50 percent over the past two years, driven by Gen Z demand. While the market continues to be lucrative, it is clear hard liquors are no longer favored by young demographics.In this case, it\u2019s probably worth it for Moutai to break young shoppers\u2019 prejudices of being an \u201cold businessman liquor\u201d and have a sweet-tooth makeover.Wine and other alcoholic drinks seek out younger talentYet, ice cream partnerships are not the only way to reach young audiences. In a bid to find the \u201cyouth formula,\u201d alcohol players have also been looking to adapt themselves. This month, Chilean wine Los Vascos has teamed up with domestic emerging coffee brand @once\u5409\u996e to create a set of beverages for camping \u2014 Glamping@once \u2014 which leverages the growing interest in the outdoors. On Xiaohongshu, it has amassed a considerable number of UGC instances. Launchmetrics found it has garnered $7,666 (51,335 RMB) media impact value (MIV), mostly due to its sophisticated packaging and indispensable gear.Given that fewer citizens are traveling currently, Mexican beer Corona allied with local personal care brand Rever \u4e50\u82e5 to recreate the holiday vibe at home with sea salt-fruited beer and colorful bath bombs. The relaxing atmosphere Corona x Rever is attempting to build to comfort locked-at-home consumers is likely to bring it closer to locals. For Zhu, the initiative will help the two to have a followers exchange and reach a wider audience, given their very different consumer bases. Indeed, an impressive $19,360 MIV (129,660 RMB) was achieved by the endeavor, as per Launchmetrics\u2019 findings.Fashion partners win outTo make a wine brand cool in the eyes of young shoppers and fashionistas, designer establishments offer good options. Ecco Domani x Private Policy is the perfect example of this trend in China. The contemporary wine firm tapped domestic gender-fluid label Private Policy NYC to design their 2022 limited edition Pinot Grigio bottle. The duo designed the container with the sparkling city lights and starry skies of New York in a bid to harness \u201cinfinite possibilities.\u201dAccording to the research conducted by McKinsey, the proportion of Chinese consumers who prefer to buy local has grown from 15 percent in 2011 to 85 percent in 2020. CIC\u2019s report shows that the market size of homegrown designer brands is estimated to have exceeded $13.5 billion in 2020 (from $1.64 billion in 2011). This may indicate that sales of the special edition will be lifted in China mainland.\u201cIt\u2019s great to see international brands collaborating with Chinese designers. It shows inclusion,\u201d commented Griffiths on this intriguing union. And clearly the association is also beneficial for the wine company: Private Policy can help Ecco Domani boost its awareness locally and still imbue the effort with a global air from their New York base.Last but not least, should drinks businesses give the blind box wave a miss? Australian organic winery Baaswood has aligned itself with Mengqi Culture IP toys \u2014 Milolo and Bear Bernie \u2014 to add a touch of surprise to their offerings. Not everyone was convinced. \u201cI\u2019m worried about the infantilization of the wine market, maybe they have pushed too much by partnering with blind boxes,\u201d Griffiths added. For obvious reasons, alcohol and blind boxes have very different targets.With young cohorts enjoying a glass of wine at home or in bars, alone and with friends, luxury maisons should closely monitor this trend for marketing buzz or even as a potential extension of their lifestyle category. \u201cThe partnership between luxury and wine will help both parties to enhance their brand image, creating an enjoyable lifestyle, and embedding the \u2018luxury\u2019 label more into every aspect of consumers\u2019 lives,\u201d stated Zhu. Some collaborations may just be a marketing stunt, admittedly. But for successful businesses like Moutai, whose annual sales surpassed $150 billion (1 trillion RMB) in 2021, the question it poses is not how to stay relevant today, but tomorrow.The column also features in Jing Daily\u2019s weekly Collabs and Drops newsletter \u2014 a 360-degree lowdown on the world of collaboration.

Complaints over pricey ice creams from new domestic brands and the \u201csudden\u201d disappearance of traditional popsicles in retail stores have taken over social media, with a related hashtag attracting over 600 million of views on microblogging site Weibo since Tuesday.China accounts for one of the world\u2019s largest and fastest-growing ice cream markets with an estimated market size of more than 160 billion yuan in 2021, according to a May report by China Green Food Association. Domestic dairy enterprises, such as Yili and Mengniu, have long focused on the country\u2019s low-end vertical, offering products priced between 2 yuan and 5 yuan for consumers, while international brands have dominated the premium category.But new domestic players have gradually cracked the market since 2016 with marketing campaigns targeting young consumers willing to spend more. For example, one such brand, Zhongxuegao, introduced its first six ice cream products priced as much as 66 yuan in 2018 and went on to top the 2020 \u201cDouble 11\u201d shopping festival sales in its respective category.The business success has attracted more newcomers from a wide range of food and beverage sectors. In May, Chinese liquor behemoth Kweichow Moutai opened its first ice cream shop in the southwestern Guizhou province and launched a set of three alcohol-infused ice creams for an average price of 60 yuan.However, the rising cost of raw materials, which has intensified amid the pandemic, has led to price hikes. The price of milk and cream has surged by 80% from 2008 to 2020, according to data from an online agriculture produce marketplace.Most customers accustomed to lower-priced ice creams say they\u2019re not ready to pay premium prices for their beloved summer treat. A survey by market consultancy firm iMedia showed more than 80% of the surveyed consumers wouldn\u2019t accept paying an ice cream priced at more than 10 yuan.On social media sites such as the lifestyle platform Xiaohongshu, some users were offering ideas to dodge the so-called \u201cice cream assassins.\u201dMeanwhile, many ice cream lovers like Wang believe the new products were enticing, but they would instead stay loyal to the brands that have been around for a long time since they\u2019re used to both the flavor and the price.\u201cI would rather buy four 5 yuan ice cream bars with a chocolate shell for the same price,\u201d she said, referring to the pricer popsicle.Editor: Bibek Bhandari.(Header image: Visual elements from VCG, reedited by Sixth Tone)",

It was founded in 1999.The firm\u2019s shares have been the most expensive in the Chinese mainland for many years, earning stable returns for investors. It valued by the market CNY2.5 trillion (US$374.1 billion \u2013 more than three times the value of Diageo).Kweichow Moutai achieved a 12.3% increase in net profit to CNY52.5 billion last year.

            "description": "Key takeaways Russia\u2019s default on sovereign debt does not have significant implications for the country or the global economy; the event may spook some investors in non-aligned markets.For the rest of the year, G7 partners will attempt find workable solutions to the conundrum of keeping oil and gas flowing out of Russia while reducing revenue inflows.The likelihood of imposing secondary sanctions against Chinese firms selling into Russia is now higher but China is taking a careful approach in order to avoid these.In the previous edition of the Global Sanctions Dashboard, we may have expressed some slight impatience at Europe\u2019s lack of resolve in diversifying away from Russian hydrocarbons. However, in early June, after painstaking negotiations among the 27 member states, the EU did agree on banning seaborne imports of Russian oil and reducing Russian oil imports by 90 percent by the end of this year. Pressure had grown in the intervening weeks, as Russia\u2019s record revenues\u2013enabled by high prices\u2013had helped the ruble appreciate beyond pre-invasion exchange rates.This week\u2019s main development has been Russia\u2019s (predictable) failure to meet small dollar-denominated interest payments. The Ministry of Finance had skillfully avoided defaulting in April but, this time, the expiration of the US Treasury exemption for the servicing of foreign debt simply meant that Western institutions could not process payments to bondholders.In this summer edition of the Global Sanctions Dashboard, we will delve into both of these developments. But that\u2019s not all. As the US Government starts to pick up on small Chinese firms \u201cbackfilling\u201d for embargoed Western goods, we consider the likelihood of secondary sanctions imposed against China. We also look at the trends in designations of individuals and firms and check out sanctions on illicit actors in the Middle East.Russia\u2019s default on sovereign debtBack in April, some were surprised that Russia avoided defaulting on its sovereign debt. However, this week\u2019s outcome was something of a foregone conclusion. Little over a month later Russia failed to deliver about $100 million in interest on two bonds, the grace period for these payments expired\u2013pushing Russia into default. The reason Russia has been unable to meet these payments is not a lack of funds. On May 25th, the US Treasury Department\u2019s formal exemption allowing US banks to process sovereign debt payments on Russia\u2019s behalf expired.Moscow is refusing to acknowledge the default, claiming that it has at least attempted to make the payments. In fact, Russia transferred the money to a clearing house in Belgium, where the assets got frozen because the clearing house cannot settle any securities subject to sanctions. What will happen to these funds is unclear. Ultimately, bondholders are likely to recuperate some of the original principal, possibly in a different currency. The funds are unlikely to be reallocated to Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction.The default does not have significant implications for the Russian or the world economy. The US rationale in making this inevitable was that degrading Russia\u2019s veneer of financial respectability would spook potential investors and business partners in non-aligned markets. Russia is already cut off from capital markets and cannot raise money in global financial markets due to sanctions, which is why the default will have little to no influence on the Russian economy in the short term. In the longer term, Russia\u2019s attempts to meet some of future repayments will continue to be thwarted until the US Treasury decides to introduce another exemption. However, given the recent G7 statements and introduction of additional restrictions on Russian gold imports, the US and allies are unlikely to ease up on Russia as long as Moscow continues its brutal war against Ukraine.Energy sanctions against RussiaThe EU\u2019s partial ban on Russian oil is a more consequential development. It took a while to get agreed on and still has to be formally ratified. The ban is expected to cut 90 percent of Russian (mostly seaborne) oil imports by the end of the year, leaving the 10 percent exemption for the Southern Druzhba pipeline.For the rest of the year, the EU and G7 partners will be focused on solving the puzzle of keeping the oil outflow from Russia while reducing the revenue inflow to Moscow. The GeoEconomics Center called on three experts (two policymakers and one markets analyst) for their takes on the pros and cons of the price cap under discussion at the G7 this week.To avoid a unilateral US approach via secondary sanctions, one prominent idea is to cap the global price of Russian oil via insurance markets. However, it remains to be seen whether the US Treasury and G7 partners can come up with effective enforcement mechanisms and avoid more market distortions and higher oil prices.In addition to the oil ban, the US and allies have also maintained sanctions and export controls against Russian oil and gas companies, although the US is far ahead of its allies in this respect.Remarkably, the US Treasury and Commerce departments both impose restrictions on Russian energy companies. The US Treasury designates them under the Sectoral Sanctions Identification (SSI) and Specially Designated Nationals And Blocked Persons List (SDN). Meanwhile, the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security maintains the Entity List. The primary difference between the two designations is that the BIS Entity List restricts the flow of physical products to designated companies while OFAC designations can include financial as well as export restrictions.Thus, in response to Putin\u2019s attempt at a fully-fledged invasion of Ukraine, the US Treasury has targeted every aspect of Russia\u2019s economy, from finance, to trade, to key industries like energy and metals, while the Commerce Department has been busy curbing exports to Russian tech, shipbuilding, and aircraft manufacturing companies.Irrespective of sanctions, most foreign companies are leaving RussiaIn addition to complying with government-imposed Russia sanctions, numerous private companies have chosen to \u201csanction\u201d themselves by suspending operations or withdrawing from the Russian market altogether. For example, BP exited the Russian market and took a $25 billion hit after writing down its 20 percent share in government-owned Rosneft. Similarly, Shell\u2019s withdrawal from its involvement in all Russian hydrocarbons has cost the company around $5 billion. Regardless of the costs associated with leaving the Russian market, Western companies prefer eating the costs now rather than staying in the market and facing significant reputational and sanctions compliance risks. Given that the US and allies have not given signs of slowing down with Russia sanctions, we don\u2019t anticipate any wave of reinvestment by Western companies any time soon.The threat of secondary sanctions against ChinaWashington has picked up its warnings against Beijing about the potential consequences of undermining US sanctions against Russia, the likelihood of imposing secondary sanctions against China is now at an all-time high. Secondary sanctions are an effective instrument with the potential to deeply hurt the Chinese economy, as Chinese supply chains are not fully insulated. However, the US could also experience some blowback from its own secondary sanctions by undermining relationships with European allies, who fear their firms may be affected.As you will see in the chart below, the fact is that the US already does sanction Chinese entities and individuals, including companies advancing China\u2019s military-industrial complex. However, secondary sanctions would be much more destructive than existing primary sanctions.Secondary sanctions would pressure companies, banks, and individuals to stop engaging with sanctioned Chinese entities, or lose access to US financial institutions. Given that China is highly dependent on third party providers for technological production, it has been approaching the secondary sanctions threat carefully. Some Chinese companies have even moved away from transactions with Russia. For example, UnionPay, China\u2019s credit card processor, refused to transact with Russian banks after Visa and MasterCard stopped serving them. Moreover, China has reduced its exports to Russia. China\u2019s approach is understandable, as the country is highly dependent on foreign suppliers for semiconductors and civilian airplanes production components. Although Beijing is working towards insulating its economy against Western sanctions, in the short to medium term, it is likely to avoid undermining US sanctions.Sanctions decelerationRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has resulted in the harshest ever package of sanctions imposed on any other country of its size, with February and March seeing the sharpest escalation of sanctions. However, more recently, as Western jurisdictions have been observing which types of sanctions and punitive measures have been effective in thwarting Russia\u2019s war chest, the occurrence of new listings has declined across all Western sanctioning jurisdictions. The Russia-driven sudden uptick in sanctions in response to Ukraine\u2019s invasion is likely to remain a one-time precedent, with new Russia designations becoming less frequent but more targeted.Middle Eastern illicit networksAside from Russia, the Middle East stands out as the region most targeted by recent US sanctions, with designations hitting actors ranging from ISIS members in Syria to oil smuggling networks in Lebanon. In Syria, the US targeted five individuals for their role in facilitating the transportation of extremists and conducting financial transactions in support of recruitment of foreign fighters by ISIS. The Treasury also targeted an international oil smuggling and money laundering network that facilitated the sale of Iranian oil in order to support Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF) in Iran. In both cases, the Treasury is restricting all transactions of US persons with the designated entities and individuals. Moreover, US institutions might become subject to sanctions if they facilitate transactions for designated entities and individuals, which is likely to be effective in preventing illicit networks from moving money through US financial institutions.In the proverbial pipelineWestern sanctions have succeeded in causing Russia to default on its sovereign debt and isolated Russia from the global economy, but the cost has been high. Uncertainty over supply has sent energy prices flying. Figuring out how to minimize the blowback on Western economies will be a priority for G7 partners after their meeting in Bavaria. We will see whether the US Treasury, which is actively promoting the price cap idea, will succeed in getting the EU on board to enforce it. In the meantime, China is likely to do enough to avoid US secondary sanctions, even if that requires moving away from transactions with Russia and reducing the volume of its exports. Finally, sanctions on illicit networks in the Middle East are likely to be successful in cutting their access to finance, hopefully slowing down the pace of their transactions and operations.Research Support from: Carrie HsuGlobal Sanctions Dashboard The Global Sanctions Dashboard provides a global overview of various sanctions regimes and lists.

He used the job to seek benefits for others by obtaining and changing Maotai liquor's management rights and material supplies, as well as receiving bribes amounting to about 102.6 million yuan ($15.3 billion). The court will turn over Du's assets to the state treasury.Yuan Renguo, former chairman of Kweichow Moutai, was also sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2021 for taking bribes.The company's business has shown an upward trend despite the controversy.

            "description": "2022-06-22 08:00:00\uff08Foto: VCG\uff09Das neu auf den Markt gebrachte Moutai-Eis, das vom chinesischen Hersteller hochwertiger Spirituosen Kweichow Moutai Co Ltd. und dem Molkereiproduzenten Mengniu Dairy Co Ltd. entwickelt wurde, hat sich bei den Verbrauchern schnell einen Namen gemacht.In den vergangenen Jahren haben zahlreiche chinesische und ausl\u00e4ndische Speiseeish\u00e4ndler mit Akteuren anderer Branchen zusammengearbeitet, darunter Einzelh\u00e4ndler f\u00fcr Spirituosen, Kaffee und Tee sowie Sehensw\u00fcrdigkeiten, Universit\u00e4ten und Museen, und es wurden zahlreiche branchen\u00fcbergreifende innovative Eissorten eingef\u00fchrt.So kooperierte beispielsweise eine Eismarke des chinesischen Molkereiunternehmens Yili Group mit Costa Coffee. Die Luzhou Laojiao Group, ein f\u00fchrender chinesischer Spirituosenhersteller aus der Provinz Sichuan, kooperierte mit der lokalen Speiseeismarke Chicecream und brachte Produkte auf den Markt, die Spirituosen und Milch miteinander verbinden. Wall\u2018s, eine Speiseeismarke des britisch-niederl\u00e4ndischen Konsumg\u00fcterunternehmens Unilever PLC, kooperierte mit dem f\u00fchrenden chinesischen Milchteehersteller Nayuki. H\u00e4agen-Dazs, eine US-amerikanische Speiseeismarke von General Mills Inc, hat mit dem chinesischen Spielzeughersteller Pop Mart und dem Louvre-Museum zusammengearbeitet. Zhu Baowei, ein Analyst der Speiseeisbranche, sagt: \u201eSpeiseeis bietet ein bemerkenswertes Potenzial f\u00fcr weiteres Wachstum und hat Investitionen von verschiedenen Unternehmen angezogen. Im Vergleich zu anderen Lebensmittelkategorien hat Speiseeis die nat\u00fcrliche Eigenschaft, eine emotionale Verbindung zu den Verbrauchern herzustellen. Es ist f\u00fcr Einzelh\u00e4ndler einfacher, die Produkte zu vermarkten.\u201cDie Marktgr\u00f6\u00dfe der chinesischen Speiseeisindustrie, die in den 1990er-Jahren entstand, hat die der Vereinigten Staaten inzwischen \u00fcberholt. Von 2015 bis 2021 stieg der Umsatz von Speiseeis in China von unter 90 Milliarden Yuan RMB auf 160 Milliarden Yuan RMB, was einem Bericht des in Shenzhen in der Provinz Guangdong ans\u00e4ssigen Qianzhan Industry Research Institute zufolge einem kumulativen Anstieg von 90 Prozent entspricht.Obwohl der Pro-Kopf-Konsum immer noch weit unter dem vieler anderer L\u00e4nder liegt, weist der chinesische Speiseeismarkt ein erhebliches Wachstumspotenzial auf. Laut GlobalData, einem in London ans\u00e4ssigen Datenanalyse- und Beratungsunternehmen, betrug der Pro-Kopf-Konsum von Speiseeis in China im Jahr 2021 2,9 Kilogramm und war damit doppelt so hoch wie im Jahr 2011. Der durchschnittliche Pro-Kopf-Konsum von Speiseeis im asiatisch-pazifischen Raum habe 2021 bei 2,1 Kilogramm gelegen, w\u00e4hrend der weltweite Durchschnitt 4,5 Kilogramm betragen habe, so GlobalData.Dank kontinuierlicher Innovationen und grenz\u00fcberschreitender Zusammenarbeit mit anderen Branchen konnte die in der Inneren Mongolei ans\u00e4ssige Mengniu Dairy im Jahr 2021 einen Umsatz von 4,24 Milliarden Yuan RMB erzielen, 61 Prozent mehr als im Vorjahr. Wie aus dem j\u00e4hrlichen Gewinnbericht hervorgeht, erreichten die Umsatzerl\u00f6se, der Nettogewinn und die Gewinnspanne der Speiseeis-Kategorie alle neue H\u00f6chstwerte. Mengniu Dairy und Universal Studios Beijing Resort haben gemeinsam ein Minion-Eis auf den Markt gebracht, das sich in dem Resort zu einem Hit entwickelt hat. Im vergangenen Jahr hat der Molkereiproduzent auch mit dem einheimischen Teeh\u00e4ndler Xiaoguan Tea zusammengearbeitet und Eisprodukte mit Teegeschmack herausgebracht.Zhu Danpeng, ein Analyst der Lebensmittel- und Getr\u00e4nkeindustrie, erkl\u00e4rt: \u201eSpeiseeis ist eine der Lieblingskategorien junger Verbraucher und hat in den vergangenen Jahren ein positives Wachstum verzeichnet. Viele Unternehmen m\u00f6chten eine einflussreichere Marke aufbauen und mehr junge Verbraucher anziehen, um so ihr Gesch\u00e4ft mit Speiseeis auszubauen.\u201c Einer fr\u00fcheren Umfrage der Marktforschungsunternehmen KuRunData und Mintel sind die drei wichtigsten Gr\u00fcnde f\u00fcr chinesische Verbraucher, Speiseeis zu kaufen, neue Geschmacksrichtungen auszuprobieren, sich selbst zu belohnen und ein Dessert nach dem Essen zu genie\u00dfen.Derzeit gibt es in China mehr als 40.000 registrierte Eisverk\u00e4ufer, von denen mehr als 90 Prozent Einzelh\u00e4ndler sind. \u00dcber 4.000 Unternehmen, die Eis produzierten, sind in der Provinz Guangdong angesiedelt, die h\u00f6chste Zahl unter allen Regionen. Laut Tianyancha, einem Anbieter von Unternehmensinformationen, wurden 2017 mehr als 8.200 Speiseeisunternehmen in China registriert und die Zahl erreichte ein F\u00fcnfjahreshoch."

They then transported the cases to the liquor store or other receiving points, and then uniformly packaged them to logistics companies for domestic sales.The action hit two smuggling gangs, hit five private goods warehouses and receiving points and detained 19 people suspected of being involved in the smuggling operations.Some 2,000 bottles of liquor goods, valued at nearly RMB3 million were also seized for smuggling two minivans and a batch of cash.Local police authorities have increased the number of operations to prevent smuggling between the SAR and mainland China this year as part of efforts to reduce Covid-19 pandemic risks.",

The Kweichow Moutai group, which produces the spirit, is headquartered there.Moutai is the most expensive type of baijiu, which is often referred to as China\u2019s \u201cnational spirit.\u201d It\u2019s almost exclusively drunk in the country yet is the world\u2019s most heavily consumed hard liquor. It\u2019s served at pretty much every festive occasion across the nation, from wedding receptions to business banquets.While the cheapest bottles of baijiu cost as little as $1 at convenience stores in China, a 500 milliliter to 700 milliliter (18 to 24 fluid ounce) bottle of Moutai typically costs from 1,499 yuan ($223), to over 16,000 yuan ($2,390) for rare vintages. In 2021, a rare case of Moutai sold for more than $1 million in London \u2013 the highest price ever paid at an auction for a single lot of the spirit outside China.The new Moutai ice cream store opened on May 19, 2022 in the Chinese city of Zunyi. VCG/Getty ImagesHow does it taste?Given that Moutai\u2019s strong taste has earned it the nickname \u201cfirewater,\u201d many people in China have been curious about how an ice cream flavored with the liquor might taste.The ice cream store will reportedly introduce 14 flavors of Moutai-infused ice cream including matcha, chocolate and green plum, with prices ranging from 39.9 yuan ($6) to more than 100 yuan ($15) per serving.Those who have already tried the ice cream describe it as having \u201ca light Moutai flavor\u201d, according to local media reports.Distilled from sorghum and rice, a batch of Moutai goes through eight rounds of subterranean fermentation over the course of a year, a process that gives the spirit an almost savory flavor resembling soy sauce. Notes of mushroom, caramel and bitter herbs add to the amazingly rich flavor.The shop will officially open on May 29, but for now two flavors of Moutai ice cream are available: the original Moutai ice cream and vanilla Moutai ice cream, each selling at 39 yuan per serving.Heart-shaped ice cream products on sale at the new Moutai ice cream store. VCG/Getty ImagesMoutai ice cream is more expensive than Haagen-Dazs, arguably the most famous ice cream brand in China. But while brands like Haagen-Dazs offer distribution options through cold chains, for now Moutai ice cream can only be enjoyed in the flagship shop.That has left foodies across the country longing for a taste of the baijiu-infused ice cream.\u201cIt seems that Moutai ice cream will turn into a buzz. I can\u2019t afford the liquor, but I can definitely afford an ice cream. I must try it some time,\u201d says one post on China\u2019s Twitter-like microblog platform, Weibo.\u201cWhen will the Moutai ice cream store also open in Beijing?\u201d another asked.Don\u2019t eat and driveLiquor distiller Kweichow Moutai is now China\u2019s second-most valuable publicly-listed company, with a market cap of over $338 billion.The brand\u2019s foray into the ice cream world has sparked both delight and debate. A hashtag that translates to \u201cMoutai ice cream is 39 yuan per serving\u201d has amassed over 180 million views on Weibo.But while some felt Moutai may be an odd choice for an ice cream flavor, many hailed the innovation.\u201cWhy can\u2019t there be Moutai ice cream while there is rum ice cream?\u201d wrote one Weibo user.\u201cMoutai distillers can also launch ice creams according to the series of Moutai vintages. A salty ice cream with a baijiu flavor may become a market to watch as well,\u201d stated another.Some are already looking forward to the next crossover, hoping for Moutai-infused chocolate, coffee and milk tea.Netizens were nevertheless swift in questioning the potential effects of consuming the alcohol-infused ice cream.\u201cWill one get tipsy upon eating one cone if they can\u2019t hold their liquor at all?\u201dProduced jointly by the Kweichow Moutai group and one of China\u2019s biggest dairy companies, Mengniu Dairy, the ice cream is made up of 50 grams of Moutai per kilogram of milk, customer service staff at the International Hotel told local media.Because it contains an alcohol concentration of 3%, the research and development team advises consumers not to drive after eating it and minors are not allowed to buy it.Moutai is not the first brand to get a bit adventurous with China\u2019s national spirit. Baijiu-infused pizza and gummy bears have already hit the market, while one chef in Beijing invented a deep-fried baijiu cake.",

            "description": "NewsBy Patrick SchmittThree rising stars of the hospitality world were rewarded this week at the Chaine des Rotisseurs GB Young Professional Awards at the new Harrods Social by Jason Atherton.The winners were an inspirational set of \u2018Young Professionals\u2019 with interesting stories to tell, such as Young Chef of the Year Liam Rogers, aged 25, who got to the Grand Finals of Master Chef: The Professionals \u2013 despite being the youngest chef in the competition.Another winner in the competition by the Chaine des Rotisseurs, Freddie Johnson, also 25, from The Fat Duck, described himself as a failed chef and failed academic \u2013 until he discovered wine.And finally, 22 year old Magdalena Babik, who was the winner of the Gerard Basset Trophy for the best performance in the tasting and food and wine pairing sections, came to London three years ago from her native Poland to study, and to support herself worked part-time in a Fullers pub. Her passion for wine grew so much that she chucked in university, and landed a job at Le Manoir a year ago, where she has risen to be one of the senior sommeliers.Read one for the details in full on the event and the winners for 2022.Liam Rogers, 25, of Gleneagles in Scotland \u2013 and a former MasterChef: The Professionals finalist \u2013 was crowned Young Chef of the Year, and goes forward to compete in the World Championships in Mexico at the beginning of October.In the sommelier contest, Frederick Johnson, also 25, from the Fat Duck, Bray won the coveted Young Sommelier of the Year title. He will represent Great Britain against the rest of the world this September in Wiesbaden, Germany.The best palate in the competition \u2013 Polish Magdalena Babik, 22, and currently at Le Manoir aux Quat\u2019Saisons \u2013 was awarded the Gerard Basset Trophy in honour of the much-missed sommelier and educator.Both Freddie and Magdalena were competing in their first-ever competitions.\u201cIt just goes to show what superb young talent we have in the industry now, and we are proud to be nurturing these embryonic and promising careers,\u201d said Phillip Evins, Bailli D\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 for the Cha\u00eene des R\u00f4tisseurs GB.He added, \u201cThe Chaine congratulates these worthy winners, and wishes them every success in the future; we will certainly see more of them, I am sure.\u201dYoung Sommelier of the Year, Freddie Johnson from Fulham was thrilled to win. \u201cI am delighted \u2013 and quite surprised as this was then first competition I have ever entered,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m now studying for the MS qualification, so this gives me wonderful experience.\u201dHe beat off stiff competition in the exacting theory and practical somms final, held at the Double Tree Hilton, Kensington recently, where Magdalena Babik from Le Manoir came second and Ryan Duffy of Andrew Fairlie at Gleneagles took Highly Commended.Freddie joked that he is a failed chef, and a failed academic \u2013 until he discovered wine. \u201cNothing really grabbed me at school, but I did have a passion for food and wine,\u201d he said.So he went to Tante Marie in Woking, graduated and joined the brigade at Trinity in Clapham. But he never forgot a short course on wine given by John Downes MW. \u201cIt really appealed\u201d, he recalled. \u201cI like accruing information \u2013 I suppose I am a bit of a nerd.\u201dNot sure that cooking was for him, he joined fledgling Vagabond Wines, and realised he wanted to take wine seriously. Plumpton College and a degree in wine and business studies followed, and then Phil Howard snapped him up for his Church Road restaurant. Lockdown meant there was little time to spend on the floor, so instead young and ambitious Freddie took over the wine list \u2013 growing it to 120 listings \u2013 and as the only sommelier, developed staff training.\u201cHowever, after a year, I knew I needed more experience, and to learn from the best,\u201d he said. So Freddie went to The Fat Duck, where he is now one of eight in the somms team, working with sommeliers from all over Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a steep learning curve, but I am proud of what I have achieved already. It has certainly stood me in good stead today; I suppose you could call me a rough diamond, now being polished!\u2019\u201dAnother first timer, Magdalena Babik, also came into wine through a circuitous route. She was awarded the special Gerard Basset Trophy for the best score in the blind tasting and food & wine matching sections. At the age of 19, Magdalena came to University in London from Poland, and to fund her studies worked part-time in one of Fullers\u2019 pubs. From there she worked her way up to the impressive Parcel Yard venue at Kings Cross station.\u201cI learned so much so quickly \u2013 and really loved it. It was then that I decided to ditch my studies and become a sommelier\u2019,\u201d she said. With WSET qualifications under her belt, she landed a job at Le Manoir outside Oxford, and almost a year later is one of the senior sommeliers, specialising in wine pairings. \u201cWine has always been my hobby and passion \u2013 and now I get to work with it every day,\u201d she commented.Meanwhile, Warrington-born Liam beat two young chefs from Grantley Hall in North Yorkshire \u2013 runner up Daniel Parker and highly commended Thomas Wyper. Cooking in the Knorr kitchens in Leatherhead, all the chef finalists were asked to create and execute a three-course meal for four in 3 hours, from a \u2018surprise\u2019 box of ingredients. Liam\u2019s winning menu was centred around lemon sole with brown shrimp butter; poached ballottine of chicken with chorizo and a rhubarb dessert with cr\u00e8me fraiche, tarragon and a sable biscuit.\u201cA mystery box is always tough, but I think my experience on Master Chef certainly taught me to hold my nerve and keep cool under pressure,\u201d he commented. \u201cI was definitely focussed,\u201d he added.\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a chef, right from an early age; there was no doubt about it,\u201d he recalled. Liam\u2019s father owned a restaurant in Warrington, and young Liam helped out in the kitchens from the age of 12.\u201cIt was the only way I got to see my Dad, apart from Sundays,\u201d he joked, \u201cBut that got me hooked.\u201dAfter catering college, Liam spent some time at Restaurant Andrew Fairlie at Gleneagles, and then moved to Sat Baines in Nottingham. It was there that he was encouraged to enter Master Chef. \u201cI got to the last three in the Finals \u2013 it was amazing. I was only 24, and the youngest chef in the competition from the quarter finals onwards,\u201d he said.Late last year, Liam returned to Gleneagles, this time as sous chef in the Strathearn restaurant. When he heard about the Chaine\u2019s competition and the chance to go to Mexico, he signed up immediately.\u201cI am so excited. It\u2019s a place I have always wanted to visit, Now, after three competitions, I have finally come back with a W for Win! My Dad was the first person I texted with the news,\u201d he said.Now the Young Chef and the Young Sommelier of the Year start their preparations for the Chaine\u2019s International Finals in the autumn, ably coached by their mentors and judges.Philip Evins rounded off the proceedings at Harrods by thanking all the sponsors of the Young Professional Awards.\u201cWe are extremely grateful to Bidfoods for the comprehensive mystery boxes, Wright Bros for the seafood, Bragard for the embroidered chefs\u2019 jackets, Zweisel glass, Nyetimber, Knorr and Mosimanns for all their help with the competitions, and of course Harrods and the Social brigade for the excellent lunch. Ben Purton, Operations Manager for Harrods Restaurants \u2013 and our Head Judge for the Chefs \u2013 made it all possible.\u201dOver 60 guests joined the three chef and three sommelier finalists for a lunch to celebrate their achievements.Liam Rogers\u2019 winning menu is below:Starter: Lemon sole with parsley emulsion, poached artichoke and brown butter with shrimps.Main: Poached ballotine of chicken with chicken mousse, chorizo and sweetcorn fricassee, chorizo jam,, wilted spinach and crispy chicken skin;Dessert: Poached rhubarb, rhubarb puree, whipped cr\u00e8me fraiche with tarragon and a sable biscuit.",

            "description": "NewsBy Colin HayAs we are beginning to see \u2013 and I anticipated \u2013 the highly heterogeneous reds of the 2021 Bordeaux vintage are already dividing opinion. However their white counterparts are not. These are truly excellent and, in many cases, exceptional and unique wines \u2013 and they are widely seen and duly celebrated as such.So, even if you don\u2019t share my enthusiasm for some of the reds or simply decide that, in the absence of a critical consensus on the red vintage, it would be savvy to keep one\u2019s money in one\u2019s pocket for now (not an unreasonable position), there is a strong argument to be made for not forgoing the opportunity to purchase some whites (and some Sauternes) up front, ie, at en primeur.There are perhaps two parts to that argument. The first is that en primeur prices for the entire vintage \u2013 red, white and sticky (moelleux) \u2013 tend to be largely determined by the perceived quality of the reds alone. Like 2017, then, it is credible to think that the whites will be under-priced on release relative to their (perceived) quality (and, recall, there seems to be a consensus on their perceived quality).The second part is that, quite simply, this is likely to be the best set of white Bordeaux releases since at least 2017.Indeed, I would go further still in suggesting that this is a unique and truly exceptional vintage that, for the most part, exceeds 2017 in quality.But this is to take us beyond the relative consensus and into rather more clearly subjective territory. It is, above all, to takes us beyond the warm and positive mood music over the overall quality of the vintage to the more detailed assessment of the qualities (plural) of these wines in comparison to other recent vintages. This, as ever, is where things start to get interesting. For now we are talking about taste.Crucial to all of this, for me at least, is the question of one\u2019s attitude to acidity in white Bordeaux in a context of accelerating climate change. If, like me, you have been somewhat troubled by the greater and greater probability in recent vintages (notably the trio 2018-2020) of encountering wines that are rich, fat, heavy and, dare I say, flat and lacking in tension (and the acidity that is, for me, its very precondition), then 2021 is the vintage for you. If, on the other hand, it is a certain weight and density in the mouth, a certain opulence and amplitude on the palate, that is the very precondition of greatness (and you can live with a little less tension and freshness when that is present), then 2021 \u2013 though great \u2013 may well be no greater than 2017.As is already clear, I am very much in the former camp \u2013 and, quite frankly, have found recent Bordeaux blanc sec vintages quite challenging (with, of course, notable exceptions).That brings to mind a further factor that it is important not to overlook here \u2013 accelerating climate change. For if we see global warming (or, as French vignerons rather more accurately put it, d\u00e9r\u00e8glement climatique) as the single most important contextual factor influencing the evolution of Bordeaux wines from one vintage to another, as surely we must, then vintages with as much natural acidity and natural tension as 2021 are likely to become less and less frequent. Put simply, the kind of tension that characterises this vintage is going to be ever more difficult to find.That factor was very much in my thinking as I tasted these wines \u2013 and it has certainly left a significant imprint on my relative preferences between the many star performances.In a way, it is insidious to single out truly great wines in a truly homogeneous vintage like this. For a case can be made for most of the wines that appear in my detailed tasting notes below.That said, and even if I find it impossible to choose between them, it is not at all difficult for me to identify La Mission Haut-Brion blanc and Pavillon blanc de Chateau Margaux as the two finest white wines of the vintage. And what makes them so special is what they share \u2013 a degree of tension, energy, vivacity and dynamism that comes from their searing acidity that I find truly compelling and almost entirely unprecedented in a decade of en primeur tasting experience. Haut-Brion blanc is truly wonderful, but it does not have, for me, the va-va-voom of La Mission or Pavillon blanc in this vintage.I find something of the same energy in Les Champs Libres and Grand Village blanc, from Baptiste and Julie Guinaudeau (better known, of course, for Lafleur in Pomerol). These wines are shockingly brilliant each time I taste them and the progression from one vintage to the next which has been so evident with the former for at least five vintages, is now no less palpably present at Grand Village too.It will come as a surprise to no one that Domaine de Chevalier and Smith Haut-Lafitte have put in great showings in 2021. Domaine de Chevalier is elegant, refined, multi-layered and finely pixilated and Smith, whilst remaining very true to its style and identity, is perhaps a little less oaky than in recent vintages, the spice tempered somewhat to reveal more of its minerality and its glorious sapidity.Cos d\u2019Estournel has also made in this vintage the finest blanc sec that I have ever tasted from the property \u2013 its iodine sea-spray-infused personality more immediately redolent of its Northern M\u00e9docain terroir than ever.Latour Martillac has made another fabulous wine that is charged with tension and biting freshness and Couhins-Lurton also deserves a special mention. Its 100% Sauvignon Blanc was picked in a series of tries to optimise ripeness. It has almost a certain Sauternes-esque exoticism allied with a brilliantly dynamic freshness. Like Latour Martillac and, indeed, the now reliably excellent Picque Caillou it is likely to prove exceptional value. All three will be immediately enjoyable the moment they are bottled.Highlights in 2021Best of the vintage:La Mission Haut-Brion blanc (96-98+)Pavillon blanc de Chateau Margaux (96-98+)Truly great:Cos d\u2019Estournel blanc (93-95)Les Champs Libres (94-96)Domaine de Chevalier blanc (95-97)Haut-Brion blanc (96-98)Smith Haut-Lafitte blanc (95-97)Value picks:Couhins Lurton blanc (92-94)Grand Village blanc (92-94)Latour Martillac blanc (92-94)La Louvi\u00e8re (91-93)Picque Caillou blanc (91-93+)For full tasting notes, see here.See here for db\u2019s en primeur vintage report , with appellation-by-appellation reviews on Margaux, St Julien, Pessac-Leognan & Graves, St Estephe & Haut-Medoc, Pauillac, Pomerol, St Emilion and Sauternes.",

            "description": "UAE. Two LVMH-owned houses, Givenchy and Glenmorangie, this week joined forces with Dubai Duty Free in a unique collaboration showcasing the craft and artistry of perfume creation and whisky making.The two houses conducted a ribbon-cutting ceremony with Dubai Duty Free at Dubai International Airport (DXB) Terminal 1 on Thursday (12 May) to mark an extensive month-long range of activations launched across the world\u2019s busiest international gateway on 2 May.They include three high-profile promotions in departures, a further four in arrivals and an additional 14 locations across DXB, what the two brands described as an \u201cunprecedented\u201d level of shared travel retail animations.The activities centre on a key expression from both brands. The first is male fragrance Gentleman Givenchy R\u00e9serve Priv\u00e9e, a recently introduced variation of Givenchy Gentleman (first launched in 1975 by Hubert de Givenchy and updated in 2017), which was inspired by the world of whisky.It is complemented by the acclaimed Glenmorangie Signet single malt Scotch whisky, renowned for its mocha flavours. The Glenmorangie Company Head of Distilling & Whisky Creation Dr Bill Lumsden describes it as his attempt to bring the aroma of a cup of coffee to life in a whisky, and as his proudest single malt creation. Launched in 2008, it was the first single malt whisky to use high roast \u2018chocolate\u2019 malt barley to create a spirit of espresso intensity.The retail experiences arose from a collaboration between Dr Lumsden and Gentleman Givenchy\u2019s Master Perfumers Nathalie Lorson and Olivier Cresp. From this encounter, Givenchy Gentleman Reserve Priv\u00e9e was born. The fragrance offers a striking duality between whisky absolute and iris while the evocation of woody, ambery, textured notes echo the olfactory notes of aged whisky casks.The events represent a first for both Maisons and are exclusive to Dubai Duty Free.Speaking at the ribbon-cutting ceremony, Dubai Duty Free Chief Operating Officer Ramesh Cidambi said, \u201cIt\u2019s really a privilege for us to launch this collaboration between Givenchy and Glenmorangie. To be able to introduce it through Dubai Duty Free is a fantastic opportunity. The performance of both the brands has been fantastic since we opened this area.\u201d\u201cWe are always aiming at raising the bar,\u201d said Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Managing Director Travel Retail EMEA & Americas Donatienne de Fontaines-Guillaume. \u201cIt is my pleasure and an honour for us to launch this collaboration into Dubai Duty Free.\u201dGivenchy Director General International Onur Aktas spoke warmly of the maison\u2019s strong relationship with Dubai Duty Free and commended all those involved across the three parties on the collaboration. \u201cAt the end of the day we share the same values. We have the same ambition, which is to offer new experiences for our clients so I\u2019m very happy that we can do this together.\u201dOn the previous evening the partners hosted a sumptuous evening at The Dubai EDITION\u2019s Jolie restaurant featuring a fragrance masterclass from Nathalie Lorson and a presentation by Dr Bill Lumsden.[Click on the podcast icon to listen to Philippe Farnier, newly appointed President and CEO Travel Retail LVMH Beauty, speaking with Martin Moodie about the landmark collaboration between LVMH brands]The collaboration features a 360 degree consumer journey that embraces full digital activation and a \u201cnever seen before\u201d level of trade activation.It includes 21 individual activations and additional gondolas in Dubai Duty Free\u2019s wines and spirits stores; The Dubai EDITION evening; and a disruptive consumer experience featuring an olfactive discovery journey across both fragrance and whisky. Glenmorangie tastings also boost consumer engagement.[Dubai Duty Free Chief Operating Officer Ramesh Cidambi talks to Martin Moodie about the partnership with the two LVMH brands and the retailer\u2019s encouraging recovery from the COVID doldrums]The two days\u2019 activities represented Givenchy\u2019s first PR event for Middle East travel retail. The Dubai EDITION Hotel event was attended by company representatives, press influencers and VIPs, with The Moodie Davitt Report representing travel retail media, and a senior delegation from Dubai Duty Free.Lumsden said: \u201cThere are many parallels between perfume and single malt whisky. So much so, that when I\u2019m describing my whisky, I keep the philosophy of perfume in mind, as I explore the different layers of aroma and flavour.\u201cFilled with spiralling notes of chocolate, coffee and sizzling spice, Glenmorangie Signet is one of my proudest creations. And since Gentleman Givenchy was one of the very first fragrances I ever wore, it has been a particular honour to share my whisky universe with Natalie and Olivier as they created their Re\u0301serve Prive\u0301e. I hope travellers who visit our shared retail experiences in Dubai International Airport will enjoy exploring the best of both our worlds.\u201dLorson said: \u201cIt was a great pleasure to mix our savoir-faire with that of Dr Bill and to share the heritage of our two crafts through this collaboration for Gentleman Givenchy Re\u0301serve Prive\u0301e.\u201cIn this perfume we tried to capture the fresh top note you have in the whisky with this zesty freshness, as well as the woody notes that come from the casks in which single malt is aged. As perfumers we try to do exactly the same as whisky creators. We share our love for fine raw materials, as well as patience and passion, as we seek the perfect quality for the effect we want to create.\u201d[At The Dubai EDITION event on Wednesday night, Dr Bill Lumsden chatted about his whisky journey with Martin Moodie in a compelling conversation graced at one point by Nathalie Lorson.

            "description": "NewsBy Colin HayWhether because of the quality of its terroir or the capacity of its leading estates to respond rapidly in the vineyard, Pomerol seems to have negotiated the compound challenges of the vintage more successfully than anywhere else. It is not surprising, then, that it has produced some of the wines of the vintage, writes Colin Hay.First, a note on the ratings.This year, for the first time, I have decided to provide an indicative rating for each wine alongside the published comment. All such comments and ratings are necessarily subjective (they cannot be anything else, when one thinks about it). I would urge you to look at the two together and, if anything, to privilege the comment over the rating. My aim is more to describe the wine in the context of the vintage, the appellation and recent vintages of the same and similar wines, rather than to judge the wine per se.The ratings, of course, reflect my subjective relative preferences between wines. Your palate is likely differ from mine. I hope that my comments give you at least enough information to be able to recalibrate my ratings and, in so doing, to align them more closely to your palate. To give an example: if the idea of the \u2018new classicism\u2019 leaves you cold, you may well wish to discount the (typically high) ratings I have given to wines described in such terms.2021 is, of course, a highly heterogenous vintage \u2013 and, consequently, my ratings span a considerable range (from the very high to the very low). I see little interest, either for the consumer or the producer, in publishing very low scores. Consequently, I have decided not to publish scores for wines that I have rated below 90 (here the range 89-91). Where no rating is published, the wine would have scored 88-90 or below.Finally, \u00e9levage is likely to be very important in determining the quality in bottle of these wines (rather more so than in recent vintages). I am no soothsayer and cannot predict how that will turn out. All en primeur ratings should be treated with caution and taken with a certain pinch of salt. That is never more true than it is in this vintage.Detailed tasting notesBeauregard (Pomerol; 70% Merlot; 30% Cabernet Franc; tasted at the UGCB press tasting at the Cit\u00e9 du Vin). Rich plum and cherry with a touch of baking spices. Round, seductive, with pleasing floral notes \u2013 violets perhaps, peony too \u2013 and just a suggestion of the cedar to come with bottle age. Nicely done, with decent weight on the attack, even it is tapers relatively quickly. Good balance and freshness without any astringency. 90-92 .(Pomerol; 70% Merlot; 30% Cabernet Franc; tasted at the UGCB press tasting at the Cit\u00e9 du Vin).

Blason de L\u2019Evangile (Pomerol; 84% Merlot; 16% Cabernet Franc; 13.5% alchol; tasted at the property). Quite intense and aromatically expressive. Brambles, blueberry, a little black cherry and rose petals. This has fine-grained tannins and good amplitude, even it loses a little delineation in the mid-palate. Sapid and juicy, the acidity just a little marked on the grape-skin finish. This is better than a lot of first wines, due to the quality of the tannins and the gentleness of the extraction. A strong indication of the progression here over the last couple of vintages. 89-91 .(Pomerol; 84% Merlot; 16% Cabernet Franc; 13.5% alchol; tasted at the property).

Le Bon Pasteur (Pomerol; 80% Merlot; 20% Cabernet Franc; 13.5% alcohol; a final yield of just 19 hl/ha; tasted at the UGCB Press Tasting at the Cit\u00e9 du Vin). Smoky, spicy, rich but rendered tender by the acidity. This is more floral than it usually is, with a little peony and mimosa. The tannins, however, are quite substantial and their crumbliness shades towards dryness on the finish. That said, this is long and less marked by the oak than it used to be. 89-91 .(Pomerol; 80% Merlot; 20% Cabernet Franc; 13.5% alcohol; a final yield of just 19 hl/ha; tasted at the UGCB Press Tasting at the Cit\u00e9 du Vin).

Big, bold and nicely managed, with plenty of spice to accompany the baked dark stone fruit and to stop the ferrous minerality dominating. Good clarity and precision in the mid-palate. Long, fresh and sapid on the finish. Rather classic and something of a success in the vintage. 89-91 .(Pomerol; 95% Merlot; 5% Cabernet Franc \u2013 the first year these were incorporated into the grand vin; a final yield of 27 hl/ha; aging in oak, 40% of which is new; tasted at Clos du Clocher).

Bourgneuf (Pomerol; 85% Merlot; 15% Cabernet Franc; tasted at JP Moueix in Libourne and then again from a sample sent to Paris). Aromatically intense with lots of lift, the ferrous minerality subtly expressed. On the nose, we find fruits of the forest, blueberry and a touch of black cherry skin, almond and a touch of graphite that builds with aeration. Lovely, soft and refined tannins. This is both elegant and nicely compact with a small-diameter core. The tannins grip nicely, helping to build a beautiful ultra-sapid and quite saline finish. This is very impressive and almost seems to build in concentration across the palate. Very focussed with lovely chewy tannins on the pure bramble finish. 91-93 .(Pomerol; 85% Merlot; 15% Cabernet Franc; tasted at JP Moueix in Libourne and then again from a sample sent to Paris).

Very distinctive and rather dominated by the ferrous minerality. Plum, baked plum and a little baking spice. Big and bold with bright fruit and wild if somewhat dusty herbal notes, but the tannins hint at dryness on the finish. 89-91 .(Pomerol; 94% Merlot; 6% Cabernet Franc; a final yield of 30 hl/ha; tasted at the UGCB Press Tasting at the Cit\u00e9 du Vin; in conversion to organic viticulture).

Certan de May (Pomerol; 60% Merlot; 30% Cabernet Franc; 10% Cabernet Sauvignon; tasted at JP Moueix in Libourne and then again from a sample sent to Paris). Red and black cherries and a little blackberry, but less intense than Latour \u00e0 Pomerol. Blueberries and a touch of cassis too \u2013 each varietal seems to bring something. Lovely texturally. Quite rich and saline, adding to the impression of viscosity in the mouth. A vintage that suits this wine. Refined, quite elegant with a pleasing evolution across the palate if maybe not quite as much definition and detail as the very top plateau Pomerols. But this provides a lovely ample mouthful; very juicy too. Certainly at the level of the 2020 and flattered by the 40% Cabernet. 92-94 .(Pomerol; 60% Merlot; 30% Cabernet Franc; 10% Cabernet Sauvignon; tasted at JP Moueix in Libourne and then again from a sample sent to Paris).

Very pure, almost crystalline, with the dark berry and stone fruit generously enrobed In cedar. Floral notes, too, fleur d\u2019oranger, saffron and subtle but exotic spices. Very true to itself, very fine and sapid with lots of energy and ultra fine-grained tannins. There\u2019s so much graphite that we could be in the nuclear reactor core. Distinct, very impressive and with a lovely tender, lithe and rippling juicy finish. 93-95 .(Pomerol; 75% Merlot; 25% Cabernet Sauvignon; a final yield of 38 hl/ha; tasted at the UGCB Press Tasting at the Cit\u00e9 du Vin \u2013 sat next to Ronan Laborde \u2013 and, again, at Clos du Clocher with very similar notes).

Clos de la Vieille Eglise (Pomerol; 70% Merlot; 30% Cabernet Franc; from Jean-Louis and Benoit Trocard\u2019s tiny, well placed, vineyard of 1.5 hectares; 13.5% alcohol; tasted in Paris). I liked this in 2020 and I like it again in 2021. It is impressively hedonistic in a vintage where that is rare. There\u2019s an expressive bright natural sweetness to the nose that is very attractive and that lovely florality one looks for from top Pomerol \u2013 violets and lavender alongside the dark blueberry and blackberry fruit. Plump and pulpy, fleshy and, again, bright and energetic on the palate, the acidity is an entirely positive factor here bringing vivacity to a wine with an impressive density and concentration. This has a lovely focus, nice crumbly tannins and a long finish. 90-92 .(Pomerol; 70% Merlot; 30% Cabernet Franc; from Jean-Louis and Benoit Trocard\u2019s tiny, well placed, vineyard of 1.5 hectares; 13.5% alcohol; tasted in Paris).

It is no surprise that this is excellent, coming as it does from three prime parcels on the plateau, including Merlot planted at 37 metres on blue-clay and a bloc of Cabernet Franc next to Trotanoy. But it remains a wine that is less well known than it should be given its quality. Lovely, plump, rich and ripe blueberry and black cherry fruit with an impressive natural sweetness to it. Sumptuous on the palate, with a cool-vintage Cabernet Franc signature and the sensation of squeezing fresh dark berries between one\u2019s teeth. A trace of graphite too and a brilliantly racy and energetic finish. The Cabernet Franc was harvested at 14% and it is the key to understanding this wine and its success in this vintage. 92-94 .(Pomerol; 70% Merlot; 30% Cabernet Franc; a final yield of 37 hl/ha; pH 3.6; 13.5% alcohol; tasted at the property).

La Conseillante (Pomerol; 85% Merlot and 15% Cabernet Franc; 13.3% alcohol; pH 3.6; a final yield of 39 hl/ha; 7% vinified in barrel; tasted at the property with Marielle Cazaux as the property celebrated its 150 th vintage under the ownership of the Nicolas family). Very limpid, glossy and brilliant in the glass. A sublime nose that is archetypally La Conseillante \u2013 fresh, crushed and concentrated blueberry juice, black cherry pur\u00e9e, violets and irises, cedar and pencil-shavings. The wine takes a little time to open as the aromatics slowly build. Once they have, more of the minerality is revealed \u2013 white and cracked black pepper, a little salinity and crushed stone and slate, with a slight nuttiness from the ripe grape pips. Texturally quite compact, but not as broad or dense as, say, Lafleur or Evangile, this is intensely sapid and juicy, elegant and beautifully cool and composed. It exudes like many of the top wines of the vintage a certain calm tranquillity. The finish is beautiful and brings us full circle \u2013 back to the cedar, the graphite and the violets that tell us exactly where this comes from. A great success; and a very fitting way to mark a special anniversary. 94-96 .(Pomerol; 85% Merlot and 15% Cabernet Franc; 13.3% alcohol; pH 3.6; a final yield of 39 hl/ha; 7% vinified in barrel; tasted at the property with Marielle Cazaux as the property celebrated its 150 vintage under the ownership of the Nicolas family).

La Croix de Gay (Pomerol; 95% Merlot; 5% Cabernet Franc; a final yield of 40 hl/ha; 13.3% alcohol; tasted at the UGCB Press Tasting at the Cit\u00e9 du Vin). A wine that is easily picked, with its distinctive and, as here, quite pronounced saline and iron minerality. This has impressively svelte tannins and a tender and juicy mid-palate. It is less rustic than it has sometime been in the past and there is good length here too, even if the fruit lacks a little detail and feels a little blitzed and blended. 89-91 .(Pomerol; 95% Merlot; 5% Cabernet Franc; a final yield of 40 hl/ha; 13.3% alcohol; tasted at the UGCB Press Tasting at the Cit\u00e9 du Vin).

L\u2019Eglise-Clinet (Pomerol; 85% Merlot; 15% Cabernet Franc; 14% alcohol with no chaptalisation; aging in oak barrels, 75% of which are new; tasted twice with No\u00ebmie Durantou at the property). The second sample here was even more luminous and aromatically expressive and a shade darker in its fruit profile (showcasing the Cabernet a little more). Wild strawberry as well as the darker shaded fruit from the Cabernet Franc \u2013 blueberries, blackberry, a hint (but just that) of cassis, with lots of graphite, lots of violet florality and, of course, cedar. This has a lovely walnut shell element too from the clearly ripe pips. The texture is diaphanous with velvet tannins, the intense dark berry fruit gliding and dancing; but this is also impressively dense with plenty of layering, lots of detail and excellent presence and persistence in the mouth. A fine and detailed rather than imposing architecture, with balance and harmony. A superb continuation of the line and one of the stars of the right-bank. 95-97 .(Pomerol; 85% Merlot; 15% Cabernet Franc; 14% alcohol with no chaptalisation; aging in oak barrels, 75% of which are new; tasted twice with No\u00ebmie Durantou at the property).

Cool and very closed, at first, on the nose. Plum skins, damsons, sloes, dark berry fruit, sandalwood and acacia with perhaps a hint of almond skin. On the palate, this is nicely compact, sinuous and crystalline in texture. There is good grip and structure from the tannins that build impressively towards the long, juicy, rippling finish. Quite serious, very promising and likely to reward, as it will require, patience. 92-94 .(Pomerol; 100% Merlot; pH 3.55; a final vineyard yield of 25.5 hl/ha; from a parcel of 1.2 hectares on blue clay and gravel, but only 0.5 hectares were selected for inclusion in 2021, so just 1700 bottles; vinified in barrel; from; Vignobles K and tasted at Bellefont-Belcier).

Evangile (Pomerol; 69% Merlot; 30% Cabernet Franc; 1% Cabernet Sauvignon; 14% alcohol; a final yield of less than 20 hl/ha; organic certified for the first time; aging in a combination of new and one year oak barrels and amphora). A very difficult vintage to manage in the vineyard, with the vines sprayed 23 times to reduce the threat and damage of mildew. But the result in outstanding. Black cherry and blueberry, violets and the parfumier\u2019s essence of violet, chocolate and graphite. On the palate, this is at the same time dense and compact but lithe and dynamic \u2013 with the fresh blueberry fruit seeming to radiate freshness. The acidity is nicely distributed across the palate. Texturally, this is tender and quite plump and yet soft, gentle and precise. The higher proportion of Cabernet Franc gives this added depth and a sense of profundity. I find this more savoury, more refined and more elegant in style than it used to and that is reinforced by the greater Cabernet presence in the final blend. A little closer to VCC than it used to be. 93-95.(Pomerol; 69% Merlot; 30% Cabernet Franc; 1% Cabernet Sauvignon; 14% alcohol; a final yield of less than 20 hl/ha; organic certified for the first time; aging in a combination of new and one year oak barrels and amphora).

Feytit Clinet (Pomerol; planted 90% Merlot; 10% Cabernet Franc \u2013 though the proportion of Cabernet Franc here certainly feels higher; tasted in Paris). Another success from Jeremy Chasseuil; I actually like this more than the 2020. A sumptuous Cabernet Franc plateau Pomerol nose of pure, plump and pulpy blueberries with dollops of graphite and a hint of cedar. There\u2019s the very slightest hint of vanilla and sweet spices too, with nutmeg and a touch of clove, but all very subtle. And there is also a delicate violet, rose and lavender florality in the background. On the palate, this is bold, big and boisterous, with a bright and expansive purple fruit, good depth and concentration, if not the clarity and delineation of the plateau\u2019s superstars, and a lovely chewy and juicy finish. There\u2019s quite a mass of as yet unresolved tannins on the finish, but absolutely no suggestion of dryness. 91-93 .(Pomerol; planted 90% Merlot; 10% Cabernet Franc \u2013 though the proportion of Cabernet Franc here certainly feels higher; tasted in Paris).

La Fleur de Gay (Pomerol; 95% Merlot; 5% Cabernet Franc; from 2 hectares in three blocks on the plateau, next to Lafleur and at Le Gay and Groupey; tasted from a sample sent to Paris). Rich and full, with a lovely quite compact core and a very pleasantly sweet ripe baked plum, fresh plum, damson and red cherry fruit, leather, white pepper and a just the faintest hint of graphite and white truffle. The fine-grained tannins build impressively across the palate and stretch the fruit out over the long, glacially tapering and rolling finish. There\u2019s impressive intensity to this, but not quite the detail or pixilation in the mid-palate of the plateau\u2019s superstars. But unmistakably a wine of terroir, class and quality, if not quite at the level of the last two vintages. 91-93 .(Pomerol; 95% Merlot; 5% Cabernet Franc; from 2 hectares in three blocks on the plateau, next to Lafleur and at Le Gay and Groupey; tasted from a sample sent to Paris).

La Fleur-P\u00e9trus (Pomerol; 95% Merlot; 4% Cabernet Franc; 1% Petit Verdot; tasted at JP Moueix in Libourne and then again, two weeks later, from a sample sent to Paris). A wonderful signature of crushed raspberries and blueberries, plums and damsons too and, at the same time, lots of graphite and a very complex and singular floral component \u2013 lilacs, peonies and wisteria (and a little less violet than the other Moueix Pomerols). This is also a shade lighter in the hue of the fruit than Hosanna, but with the same sumptuous attack and glossy mid-palate. Dense and compact for the vintage, with lots of saline and ferrous minerality interwoven with the fruit and the acidity. There is a fantastic sense of forward momentum on the palate and a pleasing structural evolution in the mouth. But much of the interest and detail comes from the rippling, rolling sinuous presentation of the fruit on the palate. This shimmers. It is not as dark-fruited as either Hosanna or Trotanoy and is a little brighter and more lifted perhaps too. Very long and quite aerial on the finish, with great minerality and impressive concentration. This is, for me, Moueix Pomerol of the vintage, though Hosanna runs it very close (this has just a little more complexity and a little more structure). 94-96+ .(Pomerol; 95% Merlot; 4% Cabernet Franc; 1% Petit Verdot; tasted at JP Moueix in Libourne and then again, two weeks later, from a sample sent to Paris).

This is not a second wine, but a second label coming from separate parcels on a clay-sand terroir. It is also the product of a strict selection. That certainly helps here.

This is, as ever, quite ferrous in its minerality but with a gentle touch of oak spice, reinforcing the graphite and cedar elements.

Very closed at first, if a little less so at the property. Rather more difficult to pick as Gazin than it often is. Soft and gentle on the attack, this rather more red-fruited than usual, with a slightly lactic note too (though that dissipates with aeration in the glass). This is very refined with fine-grained tannins but it remains a little timid and shy. The mid-palate I also find to lack a little detail and delineation though there is a nice sapidity to it. A little disappointing on this showing \u2013 one senses perhaps the challenges of the vintage; I\u2019ll be keen to re-taste. 90-92 .(Pomerol; 100% Merlot; a final yield of just 18 hl/ha with the clay so sticky that tractors were unable to penetrate part of the vineyard; tasted at the UGCB press tasting and then at the property with similar notes).

La Grave Trigant de Boisset (Pomerol; 96% Merlot; 4% Cabernet Franc; tasted at JP Moueix in Libourne and then again from a sample sent to Paris). Floral. Cedary. More compact than most and nicely lipid and sinuous \u2013 structurally and texturally quite fluid, but in comparison with the other Moueix Pomerols this lacks a bit of complexity. A little smoke, even a hint of bonfire, wild herbs and that pure but slightly blitzed dark and red berry fruit. Reasonably long but there is little grip and gather from the tannins to shape the finish. Very pleasant and nicely done, but just a little shapeless. 89-91 .(Pomerol; 96% Merlot; 4% Cabernet Franc; tasted at JP Moueix in Libourne and then again from a sample sent to Paris). Floral.

Hosanna (Pomerol; 75% Merlot; 25% Cabernet Franc; tasted at JP Moueix in Libourne and then again from a fuller and more ample sample sent to Paris two weeks later). Composed, cool, elegant and just a little restrained in a delightfully refined way. Lovely violets and cedar intermingle beautifully \u2013 bringing gorgeous and striking aromatics. Patchouli and rose petals build in the glass. We are in the parfumier\u2019s workshop! The higher proportion of Cabernet Franc brings so much to this in this vintage above all. Super-svelte and quite dynamic on the attack and mid-palate, but so subtle too; very viscous and saline. Not as massive as it often is and this maybe lacks a little sustenance in comparison with the last three vintages, but it is very classy, very precise and highly refined \u2013 more so than ever. A study in elegance and not at all the slight brashness of earlier years. There is some very classy wine-making on display here.

Lafleur (Pomerol; 52% Bouchet; 48% Cabernet Franc; tasted at the property). A wine that seems to transcend the vintage \u2013 as much due to the sheer care and dedication in the vineyard as the unique and exceptional character of the terroir itself, with each vine lovingly tended and vigilantly observed for the first sign of mildew on a single leaf. The greater genetic diversity of the vineyard also helps \u2013 as the vines react more differently to the same conditions than they would if they were less genetically diverse; in effect, they tend not to suffer at the same time which means vigilance is better rewarded. This feels, each time, more like an annual pilgrimage. A remarkable and unique wine in the context of any vintage and utterly transcendent in this one. More viscous, darker, deeper and somehow more profound than any other wine of the vintage, with a glorious cool plunge-pool austerity. The nose is already sublime and profoundly expressive (even if this is just a hint at some of its potential). It is intensely floral with violets, red and pink rose petals, but in a wonderfully concentrated yet seemingly entirely natural way. Crushed stones and fresh rain on a baked clay path and then all that cedar and graphite liberally enrobing the plump crunchy, fleshy, blueberries and mulberries, sloes and brambles. This is, as ever, texturally brilliant, with an incredibly compact and dense yet finely delineated and pixilated mid-palate. The rich, ripe berry fruit rolls, forming little ripples, rivulets and sometimes waves as the fresher, brighter, cassis notes seem to break through the frame set by the ultra-fine-grained tannins, refreshing the palate with acidity as they do so. Truly remarkable and for me, the wine of the vintage. 97-99 .(Pomerol; 52% Bouchet; 48% Cabernet Franc; tasted at the property).

The nose is already sublime and profoundly expressive (even if this is just a hint at some of its potential). It is intensely floral with violets, red and pink rose petals, but in a wonderfully concentrated yet seemingly entirely natural way. Crushed stones and fresh rain on a baked clay path and then all that cedar and graphite liberally enrobing the plump crunchy, fleshy, blueberries and mulberries, sloes and brambles. This is, as ever, texturally brilliant, with an incredibly compact and dense yet finely delineated and pixilated mid-palate. The rich, ripe berry fruit rolls, forming little ripples, rivulets and sometimes waves as the fresher, brighter, cassis notes seem to break through the frame set by the ultra-fine-grained tannins, refreshing the palate with acidity as they do so. Truly remarkable and for me, the wine of the vintage. . Lafleur-Gazin (Pomerol; 100% Merlot; tasted at JP Moueix in Libourne and then again from a sample sent to Paris). Straight away one picks up a touch of cedar, more than graphite. This has a bright, finger-staining, briary fruit. Brambles, blackberries, with a little raspberry and cassis and with a stalky leafy redcurrant note too. This shows what can be achieved with 100% Merlot. Not massive, but very nicely judged, Lafleur-Gazin is tense, lithe, fresh, elegant and refined with plenty of Pomerol typicity. Nice and chewy on the finish, but just a little slender. But aromatically very expressive. 90-92 .(Pomerol; 100% Merlot; tasted at JP Moueix in Libourne and then again from a sample sent to Paris).

I have a big soft spot for this typically under-appreciated Pomerol; but the 100% Merlot feels like a bit of a limiting factor in this vintage, at least here. Fresh and pure but the fruit feels a little blitzed and blended on the nose. Better on the palate, but still a little monotone and lacking complexity, the fruit stretched over too expansive a frame. As a consequence this is a little shapeless and a touch dry on the finish.(Pomerol; 100% Merlot; tasted at JP Moueix in Libourne and then again from a sample sent to Paris).

Open and aromatically expressive, with intense notes of black cherry and nice pencil-shaving elements. Two weeks later this is more expressive still and floral \u2013 with lovely Pomerol violets and dried lavender. Opulent and sumptuous on the attack for the vintage, with a lovely translucence, the soft ripe fruit rolling around the mouth in the space allowed by the quite open-texture. Crumbly tannins on the sapid grape-skin finish suggest a good future. One of the better 100% Merlot wines of the vintage, though not at the level of the 2018, 2019 or 2020. 92-94 .(Pomerol; 100% Merlot; tasted at JP Moueix in Libourne and then again from a sample sent to Paris).

Maillet (Pomerol; tasted in Paris from a sample sent by the property). Notably darker in hue and extract than most, this is almost opaque at the centre, which is rare in this vintage. Pure, floral and rather seductive on the nose in an archetypally Pomerol way \u2013 with a hint of graphite alongside the sour cherry and blueberry fruit. The palate, however, is a little more sombre and austere \u2013 indeed, this is very pure and precisely focussed. It has a pronounced and well-defined spine, nice crumbly tannins that, though substantial, do not overpower the fruit. There\u2019s an impressive density and concentration on the mid-palate too. Overall, this is promising, though it will need a little patience. 90-92 .(Pomerol; tasted in Paris from a sample sent by the property).

Fresh and lifted, with a pure blackberry fruit and a touch of graphite. This has quite a bold structure on the attack and is round on the attack; but the tannins lack polish and this is a little tart on the finish, even a touch dry.(Pomerol; 100% Merlot; a final yield of 35 hl/ha; 13,5% alcohol; tasted at the property).

Mazeyres (Pomerol; around 25% Cabernet Franc with a little Petit Verdot too; tasted in Paris from a sample sent by the property; certified organic and biodynamic). This is excellent and deserves to be better known. Quite rich, succulent and full, with fresh, pure cassis and blueberry fruit and fresh picked wild thyme. One of those wines which you taste and immediately ask whether the property is farmed biodynamically \u2013 needless to say, it is! It reminds me a little of Fonpl\u00e9gade in St Emilion \u2013 pure, bright, dynamic in the mid-palate and somehow more vivid and vibrant than most. Highly recommended and likely to prove excellent value. 90-92+ .(Pomerol; around 25% Cabernet Franc with a little Petit Verdot too; tasted in Paris from a sample sent by the property; certified organic and biodynamic).

From a sandy terroir on the edge of the Pomerol plateau. Nice and plush, with a plump dark berry and stone fruit, slightly oxidative, but with good concentration. It is perhaps a little one-dimensional, but the saline-ferrous minerality brings additional interest. Just a little dry on the finish; but this has a pleasingly open-grained texture.(Pomerol; 100% Merlot; a final yield of 20 hl/ha; tasted at Clos du Clocher).

Montviel (Pomerol; 80% Merlot; 20% Cabernet Franc; a final yield of 30 hl/ha; 13.5% alcohol; tasted at Chateau Le Gay). Tender and fleshy, with plenty of plum and plum skin on the nose. Big-boned at first but the chewy, crumbly tannins strap this quickly back to the spine. Quite an ambitious level of extraction, the style retained even in this more challenging vintage. Needs time and currently lacks a little harmony.(Pomerol; 80% Merlot; 20% Cabernet Franc; a final yield of 30 hl/ha; 13.5% alcohol; tasted at Chateau Le Gay).

Moulinet-Lasserre (Pomerol; 75% Merlot; 20% Cabernet Franc; 4.5% Malbec; 0.5% Cabernet Sauvignon; tasted at JP Moueix\u2019s offices in Libourne). One of Moueix\u2019s lesser-known Pomerols. The iron-rich minerality is reinforced on the nose by the acidity, masking a little the baked plums and plum skin fruit. There\u2019s a pleasing cedar element though the wood is more obvious than with the other Moueix wines \u2013 bringing sweet spices and vanilla. Bright and quite punchy on the attack though with the acidity tends to dominate thereafter. This starts quite broad but fades and shuts down pretty quickly.(Pomerol; 75% Merlot; 20% Cabernet Franc; 4.5% Malbec; 0.5% Cabernet Sauvignon; tasted at JP Moueix\u2019s offices in Libourne).

This is very impressive and continues the pronounced upward trajectory of recent vintages. There\u2019s a lovely natural ripe sweetness to the black cherry fruit and plenty of cool vintage Cabernet Franc character. The structure is quite tight and linear and the frame is generously enrobed by the dense Cabernet-inflected black cherry and blueberry fruit. Here too there is a little trace of blood orange and graphite too (even a hint of truffle). One appreciates the quality of the terroir. 92-94 .(Pomerol; 64% Merlot; 36% Cabernet Franc; 13.3% alcohol; pH 3.53; IPT 55; no chaptalisation; a final yield of 37 hl/ha; aging in a combination of oak barrels (35% of which are new), foudre and amphora; around 30k bottles).

La Patache (Pomerol; 85% Merlot; 15% Cabernet Franc; 13% alcohol; a final yield of 24 hl/ha; aging in oak barrels, 30% of which are new; tasted at Bellefont-Belcier). A wonderful deep purple in the class with a radiant lilac rim. Quite ferrous at first, but pleasing herbal elements emerge alongside the pure and bright sweet-scented blackberry fruit. The acidity is well-incorporated giving this a very well-integrated freshness from the attack to the sapid and juicy finish. This has a nice fluidity to the mid-palate but feels just a little dilute and stretched.(Pomerol; 85% Merlot; 15% Cabernet Franc; 13% alcohol; a final yield of 24 hl/ha; aging in oak barrels, 30% of which are new; tasted at Bellefont-Belcier).

Utterly beautiful in the glass. Limpid, viscous and lithe. On the nose, this is deep and rich, with a ripe naturally sweet and complex fruit profile \u2013 of blackberry, bramble, damson and raspberry. There is, as ever, loads of cedar and graphite and wild thyme. The palate is intense and concentrated, compact yet sinuous. There is, again, a nice gentle natural sweetness and the floral elements \u2013 violets and hibiscus \u2013 are very prominent, with fragrant gently crushed rose petals too. Soft, enticing, immersive and very complete. The sapidity and juiciness of the crunchy fruit forms itself into a glorious and quite explosive fresh wave right at the end and this finishes at the very top and the very bottom of the palate. Cool, tranquil and blissful. 94-96 .(Pomerol; 59% Merlot; 41% Bouchet; tasted at Chateau Lafleur). Utterly beautiful in the glass. Limpid, viscous and lithe.

Petit Village(Pomerol; 65% Merlot; 26% Cabernet Franc; 9% Cabernet Sauvignon; pH 3.7; alcohol 13.5%; aging in a combination of oak, 50% of which is new, and amphora; a final yield of just 25 hl/ha; from an excellently situated vineyard of 10.5 hectares on the Pomerol plateau at 38m of elevation on deep gravel and clay \u2013 le triangle d\u2019or). A lovely alluring nose of pure violets and plump black cherry and blueberry with plenty of Cabernet character (the 26% Cabernet Franc and 9% Cabernet Sauvignon is the key to the success of this wine). There\u2019s a touch of deep dark chocolate and oodles of cedar and graphite. But most of all this is intensely floral. The 2021 is very much the continuation of the new tradition established with the 2020. Soft and gentle and very pure, but dense and quite boldly structured too. Yet there is great finesse here despite the puissance (not at all easy to achieve in this vintage and a tribute to the quality of the terroir and the wine-making). Gentle aeration in the mouth yields more cassis and blueberry from the Cabernet components. It also serves to unleash waves of fresh juicy sapidity and, at the same time, to reduce the physical impression of the fine and grainy tannins. The effect is to generated little interesting ripples and rivulets. This is excellent. 93-95 .. La Petite Eglise (Pomerol; 90% Merlot; 10% Cabernet Franc; 14% alcohol; 7000 bottles; aging in oak barrels, 60% of which are new; tasted with No\u00ebmie Durantou at the property). This has a lovely cool-vintage Pomerol nose with intense cassis and blueberry notes. Here the Merlot feels like it becomes a vehicle to express the Cabernet Franc \u2013 a little like the chorus in the opera. It brings balance and harmony but doesn\u2019t steel the limelight. Bravo! This is sinuous and finely-textured, with lots of mid-palate interest and detail. It is likely to prove excellent value, as ever. 92-94 .(Pomerol; 90% Merlot; 10% Cabernet Franc; 14% alcohol; 7000 bottles; aging in oak barrels, 60% of which are new; tasted with No\u00ebmie Durantou at the property).

Petrus (Pomerol; 100% Merlot; 13.3% alcohol \u2013 up from the natural 13% with a little chaptalisation; a final yield of 33 hl/ha; pH 3.55; tasted at the property with Olivier Berrouet). Lovely limpid lilac and purple in the glass from an evidently gentle extraction. Perhaps the most accessible and immediately beautiful Petrus I have tasted en primeur. This is a wine that shows great respect for the vintage. The fruit was picked on the ripeness of the tannins, Olivier Berrouet explains. It is gloriously sumptuous and limpid texturally. Violet and wisteria notes slowly build in the glass enrobing, as they do so, the intense dark purple fruit \u2013 brambles, crushed and lightly seasoned with cracked black pepper. There is plenty of cedar and graphite too, but it stays in the background having a serene almost ghostlike presence. The extremely gentle extraction is reflected in the layering, detail and pixilation (often difficult to pick up in Petrus at this stage given its natural power). The texture is sublime with the velour and velvet of fuller, richer vintages here replaced by sheets of silk billowing in the breeze. This is incredibly elegant and never before have I tasted a Petrus so beautiful so young. We have a veritable mille feuilles of silk and satin. And, of course, there is amazing freshness here that is finely interwoven into the very structure and core of the wine (each feuille in the mille feuilles as it were). The finish is ethereal and seemingly eternal, slowly tapering towards a distant vanishing point. 96-98 .(Pomerol; 100% Merlot; 13.3% alcohol \u2013 up from the natural 13% with a little chaptalisation; a final yield of 33 hl/ha; pH 3.55; tasted at the property with Olivier Berrouet).

Le Pin (Pomerol; 100% Merlot; a final yield of 35 hl/ha; pH 3.6; 13.4% alcohol; aging in oak barrels, 65% of which are new; tasted at the property). This shows just how profound top plateau Pomerol can be in this vintage. More than perhaps any other wine of the appellation it has the cool summer identity of the vintage. Pure, bright and crunchy blackcurrants and brambles are accompanied by a delightful wild herbal note and a little touch of blood orange. This is discrete and dignified, and a little austere too, the silk and cashmere tannins intermingling with the lovely natural juiciness to build a tightly focussed compact structure which the fruit covers generously. There\u2019s a lovely cool graphite and stony minerality too. Aeration brings a little cedar into the mouth. Fresh, brilliant and with a pleasingly sweet finish, the tannins lingering at the top of the cheeks \u2013 almost forming a smile. Tender, ethereal and with a lovely poise and tension. 95-97+ .(Pomerol; 100% Merlot; a final yield of 35 hl/ha; pH 3.6; 13.4% alcohol; aging in oak barrels, 65% of which are new; tasted at the property).

Plince (Pomerol; 82% Merlot; 18% Cabernet Franc; tasted at JP Moueix in Libourne). Traditional, slightly rustic with a very evident iron-rich minerality, crushed dark berry fruit and a little cassis leafiness; a little hint of lavender too. Fluid and quite open-textured, but a little thin and this just shades towards dryness on the finish.

La Pointe (Pomerol; 82% Merlot; 18% Cabernet Franc; a final yield of 30 hl/ha; tasted at the UGCB Press Tasting at the Cit\u00e9 du Vin). The nose is very attractive with fresh raspberries and assorted autumnal fruits \u2013 brambles and blackberries and a little black cherry too. There\u2019s a little hint of thyme and some fresh spring floral notes too, and a sprinkling of nutmeg. A nicely textured and well-balanced wine with plenty of energy. It finishes just a little short and lacks a bit of mid-palate density, but the challenges of the vintage have been well-negociated. 89-91 .(Pomerol; 82% Merlot; 18% Cabernet Franc; a final yield of 30 hl/ha; tasted at the UGCB Press Tasting at the Cit\u00e9 du Vin).

Porte-Chic (Pomerol; 70% Merlot; 25% Cabernet Franc; 5% Cabernet Sauvignon; around 12000 bottles were produced; 13,5% alcohol). This comes from a tiny vineyard of around 2 hectares on what used to be the horse racing track very close to the village of Pomerol itself; it was acquired in 2010 and is produced by Benoit & Jean-Louis Trocard \u2013 better known for Clos Dubreuil (in St Emilion) and Clos de la Vieille Eglise (in Pomerol). I was looking forward to tasting this (having followed the impressive evolution here since 2018). I am not disappointed. A property to watch. Lighter in extract and hue it seems than Clos de la Vieille Eglise, this has a lovely, extremely open and expressive, violet, heather and lavender-scented nose that shouts Pomerol. The tannins are luxuriant, with the fine granularity bringing pixilation and definition to the elegant and stylish mid-palate. There\u2019s a certain austerity to this, very characteristic of the vintage, which brings nice tension to a wine that is usually just a little more immediately seductive and enticing. I rather like that. Tense, taut and quite intellectual. 92-94 .(Pomerol; 70% Merlot; 25% Cabernet Franc; 5% Cabernet Sauvignon; around 12000 bottles were produced; 13,5% alcohol).

This is a great terroir, next to Le Gay, but it is also rather prone to both frost and mildew and that is reflected in the tragically low final yield here. This is quite a big canvas wine in the context of the vintage. There\u2019s a lovely deep, dark rich blackberry fruit on the nose that builds with air, revealing as it does so notes of liquorice, baking spices and a little wood-smoke; and, very much in the spirit of the vintage, this is impressively floral. There is a gentleness to the tannins on the finish that is also very attractive. Easy, accessible and with good length. There may not be much of it, but it\u2019s rather good! 91-93 .(Pomerol; 80% Merlot; 20% Cabernet Franc; 13.5% alcohol; a final yield of 15 hl/ha; tasted at the UGCB Press Tasting at the Cit\u00e9 du Vin).

De Sales (Pomerol; 82% Merlot; 16% Cabernet Sauvignon; 2% Cabernet Franc; aging in oak barrels, just 17% of which are new; tasted from a samples sent to Paris). A lovely, classically Pomerol nose of violets and rose petals around ripe plum, damson and mulberry fruit; a hint of truffle and cedar too. There\u2019s a gentle natural sweetness to this, very soft tannins and an attractive, open-textured mid palate. The acidity gathers and builds a little towards the finish, almost hinting at dryness (but no more). Finely balanced, nicely constructed and very refreshing on the finish.

Pretty on the nose and open both aromatically and on the palate. We find a dark berry fruit of brambles and blackberries, with a little black cherry too and a hint of blueberry, a little graphite, some pencil shavings and roasted coffee beans. The ripe fruit brings with it a pleasing natural sweetness to the palate and this is deep, dark, very pure and supple, with a soft and plump fruit, the tight and finely-contoured frame very well covered.

Trotanoy (Pomerol; 100% Merlot; tasted at JP Moueix in Libourne and then again from a sample sent to Paris). Peppery on the nose, pure, lithe and intense. This is nicely compact and dense for a wine that is 100% Merlot, but this is certainly not the best recent vintage of this iconic wine. The floral signature of Trotanoy takes a little time to reveal itself \u2013 those violets slowly appearing with aeration but they remain a little muted. Re-tasted two weeks later they have blossomed and bloomed a little more and they are now beautifully enrobed in cedar. There is a nice lift and brightness to this, with crystalline precision in the mid-palate. Undoubtedly a great plateau Pomerol from a grand terroir and my heart still misses a beat for it; but it\u2019s not quite the glory one hopes for and so often experiences. I look forward to re-tasting from bottle. At present I prefer both Hosanna and La Fleur-P\u00e9trus. 92-94 .(Pomerol; 100% Merlot; tasted at JP Moueix in Libourne and then again from a sample sent to Paris).

Vieux Chateau Certan (Pomerol; 77% Merlot; 20% Cabernet Franc; 3% Cabernet Sauvignon; pH 3.62; tasted at the property with Alexandre and Guillaume Thienpont). Beautiful in the glass and utterly glorious on the nose. Fresh, aromatic, radiant and beguiling \u2013 and with a gorgeous old vine, cool summer Cabernet signature that I simply adore. The cassis and blueberry fruit is delicately wrapped in cedar and we have violet, wisteria, iris, cyclamen and rose petals in abundance. The slightly greater acidity on the palate, turns the fruit profile a shade lighter and one picks up plump, fleshy raspberry notes alongside the cassis and blueberry. There is great intensity here but also great subtlety. The structure is measured and compact and it seems to provide a stage on which the fruit floats, glides and glistens. Perhaps the most beautiful and refined wine of the vintage and, in a way, more expressive of it even than the other top plateau Pomerols (though Petrus and Le Pin come closest in that respect). The tannic grain is so fine as to be practically imperceptible and this has a lovely tenderness on the long and rolling finish. 95-97+ .(Pomerol; 77% Merlot; 20% Cabernet Franc; 3% Cabernet Sauvignon; pH 3.62; tasted at the property with Alexandre and Guillaume Thienpont).

            "description": "The Asian Games due to take place in Hangzhou in September have been postponed indefinitely, organisers said Friday, as China battles a resurgence of Covid cases.No reason was given for the delay, but China is racing to extinguish its largest outbreak of Covid-19 since the early days of the pandemic.\u201cThe Olympic Council of Asia has announced that the 19th Asian Games, originally scheduled to be held in Hangzhou, China from September 10 to 25, 2022, will be postponed,\u201d said a statement on the official Games website, first posted on Chinese state media.The new dates for the sporting contest \u201cwill be announced at a later date\u201d, the statement added.The host city of Hangzhou lies less than 200 kilometres (120 miles) from the country\u2019s biggest city, Shanghai, which has endured a weeks-long lockdown as part of the ruling Communist Party\u2019s zero-tolerance approach to the virus.Organisers said last month that Hangzhou, a city of 12 million in eastern China, had finished constructing some 56 competition venues for the Asian Games and Asian Para Games.At the time, they indicated that they planned to hold the events under a virus control plan that \u201clearns from the successful experience\u201d of the Beijing Winter Olympics, which were held in February in a strict Covid-secure bubble.Hangzhou was poised to become the third city in China to host the continental competition after Beijing in 1990 and Guangzhou in 2010.Some events were due to be held in other provincial cities including Ningbo, Wenzhou, Huzhou, Shaoxing and Jinhua.Almost all international sport has grind to a halt in China since Covid emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019.The Beijing Olympics was an exception but it was held in a strict \u201cclosed loop\u201d with everyone inside it, including athletes, staff, volunteers and media, taking daily Covid tests and not allowed to venture into the wider public.China has stubbornly stuck to a zero-Covid policy, imposing strict lockdowns, quarantines and mass testing programmes even while other countries start to reopen as the threat of the pandemic recedes.The government has touted the strategy as proof that it values human life above material concerns and can avert the public health crises seen in many Western countries.Top leaders on Thursday again vowed to \u201cunwaveringly adhere\u201d to zero-Covid and \u201cresolutely fight against\u201d criticism of the policy despite a growing public outcry against the measures.Anger is especially pointed in Shanghai, where 25 million people have seethed under a patchwork of lockdowns since March amid complaints of overzealous lockdown measures and spartan quarantine conditions.by Matthew WALSH",

            "description": "As the alcoholic beverage market expands its reach to Gen Zers and women, channels play a bigger role for domestic brands. But on top of mulling where to sell their products, brands are fixated on the creation of new consumption scenarios encouraging young and price-sensitive drinkers to open their walletsChina's low-alcohol beverage industry, which recently became a darling of venture funds, has developed by leaps and bounds with the help of women and Gen Z consumers.In the absence of a consensus on what constitutes low-alcohol beverage, this often refers to drinks with an alcohol by volume (ABV) of less than 20%. By 2023, China's low-alcohol drink market sales will reach CNY 43.9 billion (USD 6.643 billion), according to leadleo, an industry data provider.For the low-alcohol beverage industry, especially asset-light startups, which are more likely to opt for ODM and OEM models and face homogeneity, it's hard to create extraordinary flavors, and R&D can be costly.Meanwhile, it's unlikely for startups to stand out through pricing without access to a robust supply chain, which most of them don't have.Undoubtedly, targeted marketing can deliver impressive results, but consumers in this new segment are just as fickle as anywhere and haven't built or prefer not to build loyalty to any brand. More importantly, online sales is not the decisive growth driver, as is shown in the data above.Therefore, those who control the channels, especially offline channels, and match them with clever marketing, might be the final winners.A historical overviewIn 2003, with the launch of RIO (Chinese:\u9510\u6fb3\u9e21\u5c3e\u9152) the Chinese low-alcohol beverage market took off. Foreign manufacturers also entered the Chinese market, including Bacardi, one of the largest family-owned spirits companies, and Japan's alcoholic and soft beverage giant Suntory.In 2014 and 2015, the market experienced explosive growth as some top distillers unveiled low-alcohol beverage sub-brands. For example, Wuliangye (000858) (Chinese: \u4e94\u7cae\u6db2) introduced Xianlin Fruit Liquor (Chinese: \u4ed9\u6797\u679c\u9152) in 2014, and Kweichow Moutai (600519) (Chinese: \u8d35\u5dde\u8305\u53f0) debuted fruity alcoholic drink brand Umeet (Chinese: \u60a0\u871c). However, the market lost momentum due to excessive competition and product homogenization.The year 2018 saw a boom in the market after uncompetitive players were knocked out of the race. Since then, spurred by increasing investment and diversified platforms, niche products mushroomed.However, the Covid-19 epidemic in 2020 hammered the low-alcohol beverage market, slashing offline retail sales amid sporadic surges. \"This is a war-like reshuffle,\" said Shen Kai, founder of Dream Brewers (Chinese: \u68a6\u60f3\u917f\u9020), which focuses on craft beer.To survive and thrive, brands are in search of a \"trump card\" \u2013 channels that cater to targeted consumers despite the onslaught of the epidemic.Consumer profiles and their drinking cultureChina is home to about 400 million female consumers aged 20 to 60. The group annually spends about CNY 10 trillion, which is equivalent to the third-largest consumer market in the world.Meanwhile, Generation Z has become the most populous cohort, accounting for 13% of the global population. China's Gen Zers have exceeded 270 million.The two new forces \u2013 with relatively strong purchasing power \u2013 seem to go hand in hand with the expansion of the alcopop market.According to leadleo, the primary consumers of low-alcohol drinks are young women in first- and second-tier cities. Over 70% of low-alcohol beverage drinkers are 18 to 34 years old.Consequently, companies making low-alcohol drinks place a premium on the new trend. For instance, MissBerry (Chinese: \u8d1d\u745e\u751c\u5fc3), a Budweiser-backed alcohol producer that netted tens of millions of USD in Series A+ and B financing rounds last year, targets female consumers. Some startups, such as Dream Brewers and the wine maker Torre Oria (China) look to Gen Zers. Torre Oria (China) bagged hundreds of millions of CNY in Series A financing round last year.Spurred by the demand of consumers, a new drinking culture thrives, one that is drastically distinct from the decades-old tradition represented by grain-based spirits. Spirits, in particular the fiery baijiu, often are overpriced and become a status symbol. Besides, they are drunk on occasions such as banquets and signify a set of elaborate rules about social hierarchy. What's more, baijiu, often over 80 proof, is never meant to be a party drink.Many attributes of the Gen Zers and female consumers overlap. For example, they prefer designs, flavors, self-pleasure, individuality, lower prices, less emphasis on brands or types, among others.Of all these commonalities, price, however, seems to be central to consumer choices, at least according to some veteran industry insiders.\"Young people are price-sensitive,\" said Shen of Dream Brewers, which counts Sinovation Ventures among its financial backers.The performance of Dream Brewers' offline stores, often teeming with young consumers, shows that pricing plays a vital role in sales. The beer in its Shanghai store is priced at CNY 30 (USD 4.577) per pint on average, and 800 pints can be sold a night. \"If the beer is priced at CNY 60 per pint, the sales won't be so good,\" he said.Flavor is also an important issue. \"To make the flavor more new-drinker-friendly, we rid the grape skins and seeds when making wines, avoiding the sourness and bitterness,\" Zheng Junjie, chairman and founder of Torre Oria (China) (Chinese: \u5965\u5170\u4e2d\u56fd), said at a recent webinar on sparkling wine, for which EqualOcean's Chinese sister publication was a sponsor.He also came to notice how consumers under 35 prefer to drink under certain scenarios, such as before bed, between female friends, and in front of so-called \"On the Road Store,\" meaning drinking by the curbs.Offline channels enrich scenariosCreating scenarios through self-owned offline stores or unconventional channels to attract consumers seems to be the trend in the market.According to iiMedia, a market intelligence agency, the most common purchase channels for Chinese consumers of low alcoholic beverages are offline sales terminals and e-commerce platforms.\"Offline is the king,\" said Shen. \"Chinese consumers are more likely to drink in particular scenarios, such as at parties, business banquets, karaoke bars, and over barbecues.\"But competition in offline channels can be brutal. \"Restaurant channels are bought to sell one brand exclusively,\" said Shen.Thus, Dream Brewers chose to open its own stores. About 40% of its drinks are sold on premises and 30% through distributors.Serving as preposition warehouses, self-owned offline stores can also help cut shipment fees since liquors are usually heavy. \"Offline stores are actually less costly to run than online marketplaces, which come with high advertising costs,\" Shen told EqualOcean. The stores can also be used to engage customers directly and convey brand values.Since restaurants are hard to break into, TasteRoom (Chinese: \u5fd2\u65af\u7279\u917f\u9020), another brand focusing on craft beer that netted tens of millions of CNY in Series Pre-A financing round last year, added supermarkets, karaoke bars and other establishments to its list of retail channels, after starting with bars. About 80% of its sales is generated offline. \"We won't limit ourselves to any channel,\" said Pan Guanming, founder of TasteRoom, at the aforementioned webinar.On the Road Store (Chinese: \u516c\u8def\u5546\u5e97), a liquor store, also made full use of its offline channels. After finding that most young people can't socialize in their living room as they tend to rent apartments with others, the brand broadened the current drinking scenarios, which previously included only homes, bars, or restaurants, to involve drinking by the roadside. \"Today's people need a place to chill off, quick, easy, and casual,\" said Yang Boyuan, co-founder of On the Road Store.Lanzhou (Chinese: \u5170\u821f), which netted tens of millions of CNY in its pre-A financing round last year, also found a new channel to lift its offline sales. Like On the Road, Lanzhou compensated for a lack of recreational space for the youth by pushing the boundaries of alcohol sales to an unlikely place: board game parlors. The brand ingeniously blends the popular murder mystery games (Chinese: \u5267\u672c\u6740) with alcoholic drinks, creating an environment for these two elements to come together to help generate sales.Opportunities to expand channels amid the epidemicThe current surge of the epidemic hit offline businesses hard, but opportunities lurk.The gloomy offline sales spurred home drinking. Companies including Dream Brewers and Torre Oria (China) launched \"group buying,\" which could help them stem sales losses.Surprisingly, the downturn also gives startups a rare leverage in negotiation with mass offline channels such as supermarkets, which also fall on hard times due to the pandemic. Zheng of Torre Oria (China) said during the webinar that \"Sam's Club is now being very friendly to startups.\"\"The biggest impact is not about losses,\" said Yang Boyuan, co-founder of On the Road Store. \"The real damage is to the timeline, such as when to build new stores or start a sales drive, and the pace of marketing.\"Nevertheless, many companies remain optimistic despite sales decreases. \"We can work on other things, like R&D, consumer analytics and others during the epidemic,\" said Pan of TasteRoom. \"Good alcoholic beverage brands take time and energies to build. Let's take it slow.\"",

            "description": "Portugal will \u201csoon\u201d send more than 99 tonnes of medical and military equipment to Ukraine, said the defence minister, Helena Carreiras, in a note on the social network Twitter.In the publication in which the minister appears next to the Ukrainian ambassador to Portugal, Inna Ohnivets, in a photo on Monday, one can read that Portugal\u2019s \u201csupport for the resistance of Ukrainians against Russia\u2019s aggression\u201d is reaffirmed.\u201cIn this context, another 99 tonnes of military and medical supplies will be sent soon,\u201d it stresses.Last Wednesday, foreign affairs minister Jo\u00e3o Gomes Cravinho had said on arrival at a NATO meeting in Brussels that Portugal has already sent between 60 and 70 tonnes of war material to Ukraine and would send more \u201cin the near future\u201d.Asked whether Portugal is willing to supply more military equipment to Ukraine, after the NATO secretary-general warned on arrival at the meeting that the country \u201chas an urgent need\u201d for more military support and said he hoped the allies would reach an agreement to that effect, Gomes Cravinho confirmed that it is planned to send more war material, \u201ceither defensive or offensive,\u201d that is, \u201cprotective material and also offensive material,\u201d including weapons and ammunition.\u201cPortugal has been supporting Ukraine. It has already sent more than 60, 70 tons of war material to Ukraine and will send more in the near future,\u201d he said, confirming that the material to be sent soon will be of the same type, because \u201cit is the material that Portugal has available to be able to put in the hands of the Ukrainians.\u201dFor \u201cmore details\u201d, the new head of Portuguese diplomacy referred questions to his colleague and successor in the post, national defence minister Helena Carreiras.In relation to the meeting of foreign ministers of the Atlantic Alliance, taking place between today and Thursday in the Belgian capital, Jo\u00e3o Gomes Cravinho indicated that the allies will discuss the support they can continue to give to Ukraine, an issue they will have the opportunity to debate with the Ukrainian head of diplomacy, Dmytro Kuleba.\u201cWe will have with us the Ukrainian foreign affairs minister, Minister Kuleba, who will give us a briefing on the current situation in Ukraine and the perspective that the Ukrainian government has on the situation and on the support it has been receiving,\u201d he said.In relation to the policy of sanctions against Russia, and a day after the European Commission put on the table the proposal for a fifth package of restrictive measures by the European Union aimed at Moscow, the minister commented that, \u201cunfortunately, the tendency is for sanctions to be increased\u201d.\u201cI say unfortunately because this is a direct result of Russia\u2019s position. Russia continues to attack, continues to commit atrocities, unfortunately, and therefore the tendency is to increase sanctions and not to ease them,\u201d he said.On his way into the meeting, the Nato secretary-general admitted that Ukraine urgently needs more military support and said he hoped the Allies, meeting in Brussels at the level of heads of diplomacy, would agree to provide \u201cmany different kinds of equipment\u201d.\u201cUkraine has an urgent need for military support and that is the reason why it is so important that the Allies agree to further support Ukraine with many different types of equipment, both heavier equipment and also light weapons systems,\u201d Jens Stoltenberg said.The leader underlined the importance of the military support that NATO has provided to the Ukrainian army to defend itself against the Russian invasion, pointing out that \u201cit is in sight that this support has had an effect every day\u201d.\u201cWe can see the images of all the Russian armour destroyed. This is something that was done with anti-tank weapons and anti-armour weapons provided by NATO allies,\u201d he indicated.Russia launched a military offensive in Ukraine on 24 February that has killed at least 1,842 civilians, including 148 children, and wounded 2,493, including 233 minors, according to the latest figures from the UN, which warns that the actual number of civilian casualties is likely to be much higher.The war has already caused an undetermined number of military casualties and the flight of more than 11 million people, including 4.5 million to neighbouring countries.This is the worst refugee crisis in Europe since World War II (1939-1945) and the United Nations estimates that some 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance.The Russian invasion has been condemned by the international community in general, which has responded by sending arms to Ukraine and strengthening economic and political sanctions against Moscow.",

            "description": "You may not have heard the name Li Keqiang before \u2014 but you likely soon will.That's because when the Chinese premier steps down from power in March 2023, a decision he confirmed in March, it will trigger a significant reshuffle in the upper echelons of the Chinese government. In a country where the succession of power has happened both slowly and deliberately, Li's retirement could kick off a fundamental shift in roles among China's most powerful government body \u2014 the Politburo Standing Committee \u2014 and lead to further consolidation of power under Chinese leader Xi Jinping.The nexus of China's elite is often obscured by what appears to be the overwhelming control and centralization of power in Xi's hands. Having removed constitutional term limits on his role, Xi has positioned himself as the most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. He may now rule for life and continue regulating the country of 1.4 billion people with a tight grip on military reform, cybersecurity, and internet censorship.AdvertisementXi, the 68-year-old twice-married supreme leader, served as General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and Chair of the Central Military Commission before becoming president in 2013. Xi is among China's famed \"princelings\" \u2014 the descendants of prominent Communist Party officials who represent a powerful government faction.But while his princeling status \u2014 being the son of revolutionary Communist veteran Xi Zhongxun \u2014 may have helped get him to power, Xi has maintained his leadership role only by closely monitoring his inner circle and regularly shaking up the status quo.That tendency has proven dangerous for lifelong Chinese bureaucrats who get too comfortable in the bosom of the autocracy. Take former security chief Zhou Yongkang, prominent politician Bo Xilai, and Chongqing communist party chief Sun Zhengcai, for instance, all of whom were purged from the upper ranks of the Party during Xi's reign.China's impenetrable black box of powerChinese President Xi Jinping sits securely at the nexus of power in China. But the men who surround him also wield immense political clout. Xie Huanchi/Xinhua via Getty ImagesGiven the heavy censorship and control over state-linked media outlets in the country \u2014 it's nearly impossible to know what's really happening in China's halls of power.Observers have intently watched China's displays of strength at its military parades; looked into the tea leaves to predict China's line of succession post-Xi; and scrutinized seating charts to suss out government officials' proximity to the pinnacle of power.\"What people really think is opaque beneath the chess game that they play. And the chess game itself goes on inside a highly impenetrable black box,\" Perry Link, an emeritus professor of East Asian studies at Princeton University, told CNN.Experts told Insider the Politburo \u2014 the highest decision-making body of the Chinese Communist Party \u2014 and its top members are the ones who are really in control in the country, despite the clout that high-profile Chinese billionaires seem to hold.\"The government campaigns over the last year \u2014 whether focused on celebrities or education tutoring companies \u2014 demonstrate the Chinese Party-state is the final arbiter of power. Companies or individuals who seemingly rise too high and supersede the power and/or authority of the Party-state will be subjected to some form of punishment,\" Jennifer Hsu, a researcher of public opinion and foreign policy at the Lowy Institute, told Insider.AdvertisementPerhaps no one knows that better than Jack Ma.Ma, the founder of e-commerce and tech company Alibaba, enjoyed a charmed life of high-profile appearances and an overflowing bank account \u2014 Ma was reportedly worth $62 billion in 2020 at the height of his power, making him the richest man in China.But in October 2020, he criticized China's financial regulatory system, suggesting that Chinese banks were crawling along behind the times, continuing to follow global rules that are part of \"an old people's club.\"Then Ma disappeared.Some believed he'd been spirited away by the Chinese government to a detention camp. Others assumed he was deliberately lying low.Ma finally surfaced \u2014 much-chastened \u2014 in early 2021. China had opened an antitrust investigation into Alibaba and shut down Ma's plans for an Ant Group IPO. It was a potent reminder that while it's possible to reap huge financial rewards as a business leader in China, the CCP still wields the ultimate power.\"Of course, they have huge resources and 'soft power' that comes from being admired as business executives. But in the end, the Party can influence them to do what they want \u2014 it doesn't really work the other way round,\" Rana Mitter, a professor of history and modern Chinese politics at Oxford, told Insider.We took a peek into Xi's inner circle and narrowed down the list of the top 12 most influential people surrounding Xi Jinping. We spoke to experts who told us more about the inner workings of the Communist Party, what true power means in China, and who wields it.AdvertisementXi's inner circle \u2014 the Politburo Standing Committee and his vice president, Wang Qishan \u2014 call all the shotsChinese President Xi Jinping (R) arrives with Premier Li Keqiang (L) and members of the Politburo Standing Committee for a reception at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on the eve of China's National Day on September 30, 2021. Greg Baker/AFP via Getty Images)The CCP formed the first Politburo Standing Committee in July 1928. It comprised the top members of the Chinese government \u2014 including the future Chairman Mao, who became the Chinese leader in 1949. The contemporary Politburo is now thought to be handpicked by outgoing Standing Committee members in consultation with retired top leaders and previous standing committee members.The Communist Party's central committee holds closed-door meetings to choose its 25-member Politburo \u2014 and within that number is the exclusive Politburo Standing Committee. It comprises Xi and six others who meet and operate largely in secrecy.The latest reshuffle of the Politburo Standing Committee occurred in 2017 when five new members\u2014 Li Zhanshu, Wang Yang, Wang Huning, Zhao Leji, and Han Zheng \u2014 were promoted to the committee. But given that these men are all 65 and older and either close to or long past the retirement age of 67, there appears to be no clear succession plan for Xi, who has all but paved the way to break with tradition and grant himself a third term.Xi is also flanked by his vice president, Wang Qishan, who has known the Chinese leader since the two were teens. While Wang is not part of the PSC, he also wields a fair amount of power due to his proximity to Xi.Whether there will be further changes to the political landscape, and whether Xi will elect more members of allegiant factions, will be decided in the fall of 2022, when the 20th Party Congress commences.In the meantime, political power under Xi remains consolidated among the following men:Wang Qishan serves as vice president under Xi and is considered one of China's most potent 'princelings'Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan is one of Xi's key allies, and met the Chinese leader when they were teens. Pang Xinglei/Xinhua via Getty ImagesChina's Vice President Wang Qishan, 73, is Xi's right-hand man. Before Xi came to power, Wang was known as a princeling politician by marriage, rising in prominence in the CCP partly because of his marriage to the daughter of former executive vice-premier Yao Yilin.Ties to Xi: The son of an engineering professor, Wang met and befriended the then 15-year-old Xi when the pair were assigned manual labor roles in a farming community near Yan'an, Shaanxi province, during the Cultural Revolution. Wang later joined the CCP in 1983 and rose to become a ranking member of the Politburo in 2007, helping to front China's trade talks with the US.Wang also helped helm Xi's pet project, an anti-corruption purge of tens of thousands of prominent Chinese officials that kicked off in 2013. Wang, a long-standing ally of Xi's, reportedly helped the Chinese leader purge their rivals, using the anti-corruption campaign as a tool.AdvertisementPerhaps unsurprisingly, Wang is a big fan of the Netflix series \"House of Cards.\"Victor Shih, an expert in China and Pacific relations and associate professor of political science at the University of California San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy, told Insider he thinks there might be a power shift where Wang is concerned after the fall of 2022.\"Wang likely will fully retire, as will many of the technocrats he nurtured in the past,\" Shih said. \"With his own full retirement, as well as the retirement of his followers, Wang's influence will also be much diminished.\"Li Keqiang was once expected to be the successor to former President Hu Jintao but was sidelined in favor of XiLi, 66, is currently the premier of the People's Republic of China \u2014 but he's now slated to step down this fall. Ding Lin/Xinhua via Getty ImagesLi, 66, is currently the premier of the People's Republic of China and the Party secretary of the State Council of the People's Republic of China.Li's humble beginnings in Anhui, eastern China, and his career in China's Communist Youth League, helped him climb the Party's ranks. During his tenure, he focused primarily on managing China's economy, which led to the country's economic performance rating system being dubbed the \"Keqiang Index.\" Li has managed several important portfolios \u2014 he handled aspects of the Chinese economy and infrastructural growth, and was charged with drafting China's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Ties to Xi: Li is a known ally of Xi's predecessor, former President Hu Jintao, and his closeness to Hu led some to speculate that he was being groomed to succeed Hu. But after much hype, Li was sidelined for the top job in favor of Xi. Li was named premier in 2013, but Xi's decision to expand his control of the economy encroached on Li's turf, weakening Li's power to some extent. Li also saw his influence erode after China's 2015 stock market meltdown, for which he was blamed.\"Li Keqiang has been a weak premier, mostly because Xi Jinping has relied on Liu He and the Central Commission for the Comprehensive Deepening of Reform, which Xi heads,\" said Joseph Fewsmith, professor of international relations and political science and director of the Boston University Center for the Study of Asia.\"I would expect Li to exercise little influence after his retirement. The interesting question is who will replace him as premier,\" Fewsmith added, noting that Hu Chunhua, a prominent Politburo politician, might be next in line.AdvertisementLi Zhanshu was relegated to far-flung posts in rural China before staking his claim in the PolitburoPolitburo Standing Committee member Li Zhanshu is one of Xi's closest allies in the top echelons of China's power players. Yan Yan/Xinhua via Getty ImagesLi, 71, is a ranking member of the Politburo Standing Committee and the current chairman of the standing committee of China's National People's Congress. He's considered the third most powerful man in China.Li saw a minor setback in his climb to the top when in 2003, he was sent off to Heilongjiang, a far-north province, and put in charge of revitalizing China's \"rust belt.\" He composed a poem about the experience:\"A real man has no fear of dangerous tasks,Mountains are rich in beauty and peaks are ever breathtaking.The mighty autumn wind only bullies the weak,Still the falcon spreads its wings and soars toward heaven.\"As governor of Heilongjiang, Li revitalized the province's irrigation project and boosted its agricultural output. But this did little to elevate Li's status. In 2010, he was sent to Guizhou, China's poorest province, and was tasked with improving the province's infrastructure and economy.It wasn't until 2012 that fortune finally smiled upon Li. Having bided his time for close to a decade, Xi \u2014 an old friend of Li's \u2014 promoted him to the general office of the Chinese Communist Party, a role equivalent to the \"gatekeeper\" or Chief of Staff in Xi's government.He is known to abide by three \"nos\" \u2014 no messing around with people, no playing games, and no slacking off on the job.Ties to Xi: Li is thought to be one of the senior members of Xi's personal \"clique.\" Li's ties to Xi go back to the 1980s during their early days in the CCP, when Li served as party secretary one county over from Zhengding County, where Xi was CCP chief.Fewsmith, the Boston University professor, said Li Zhanshu and his colleague, Zhao Leji, were \"already very prominent\" in the Standing Committee.AdvertisementHowever, Shih believes that if Xi were to abide by the old rules that committee members must retire at 67, and not make an exception for Li and Zhao, they both might have to step down.\"However, these two have managed to cultivate and promote sizable networks in the upper echelons of the party, so they will have considerable post-retirement influence,\" Shih said.Wang Yang has a reputation as a 'reformer' and an advocate of the free marketWang is also one of the known liberals and \"reformers\" in the Communist Party. Rao Aimin/ Xinhua via Getty ImagesWang, 67, is a member of the Politburo standing committee and the Party secretary of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.Wang spent his early years involved in politics in his hometown of Anhui, climbing up through the lower ranks of local government to eventually become the party committee secretary of Chongqing. Wang is also one of the known liberals and \"reformers\" in the CCP, advocating for free markets and governing with a softer, ground-up approach.\"There's no particularly helpful way to rank (the members of the Politburo Standing Committee), but it's worth noting that Wang Yang is being tipped as a possible premier, which is intriguing as he has encouraged freer markets in the past as a provincial party secretary, and that Wang Huning is widely regarded as the ideological thinker who has influenced Xi the most,\" Mitter, the Oxford professor, said.Ties to Xi: Wang criticized the rise of \"princeling\" power in the early 2010s. That made him an unpopular choice for a seat on the Politburo Standing Committee back in 2012 when Hu Jintao was in control. But he was later elected to the 19th Politburo Standing Committee in 2017 and, in 2018, began spearheading the Chinese government's policies in the highly contested Uyghur Autonomous Region of Xinjiang.Like Li Keqiang, Wang is thought to be within the Hu faction, with Li Zhanshu and Zhao Leji being part of the Xi clique. According to think tank Brookings, being part of the Hu faction, backed by former President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao, meant being part of a \"populist coalition.\" This was as opposed to being part of Xi's \"elite coalition,\" currently the most powerful government faction.Wang Huning, described as a workaholic and insomniac, is considered the mastermind behind Xi's massive Belt and Road initiativeWang is known to be the ideological powerhouse of the Chinese leadership, and the brains behind Xi's philosophy \u2014 \"Xi Jinping Thought.\" Wang Zhao/AFP via Getty ImagesWang, 66, is the secretary of the Central Secretariat of the CCP. He was an academic at the prestigious Shanghai Fudan University before quitting to pursue politics in 1984. Wang has been described as a shadowy figure, a workaholic, and an insomniac.AdvertisementHe is credited with being the intellectual and ideological mastermind behind Xi's \"China Dream,\" an aspiration for China to become the world's dominant power. He is also the architect of \"Xi Jinping Thought,\" a 14-point policy plan to establish socialism with Chinese characteristics.Wang is seen as the Kissinger-style strategist behind Xi's Belt and Road Initiative, an aggressive foreign policy and development strategy that seeks to expand China's influence across Asia and beyond.Ties to Xi: Widely thought to be the most intelligent of all the Politburo Standing Committee Members, Wang has accompanied Xi on many overseas trips. He was also a longtime adviser in the Chinese government, serving under two of Xi's predecessors, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao.\"Wang is the ultimate survivor, and three general secretaries have relied on his advice. He will also be 67, thus eligible for another term, if the old rules apply,\" Fewsmith said. \"Xi may want him to hang around, but if Xi needs an extra seat (on the Standing Committee) for a valued friend, Wang may be sacrificed.\"Zhao Leji has helmed Xi's anti-corruption push and is responsible for arresting thousands of party officialsZhao spearheaded Xi's anti-corruption drive to purge officials accused of improper behavior. Ding Haitao/Xinhua via Getty ImagesZhao, 65, is a member of the Standing Committee and the chief of Xi's anti-corruption campaign.He was heavily involved in Xi's crackdown on \"tigers and flies\" \u2014 including the arrest of thousands of high and low-ranking officials alike \u2014 and has been at the helm of Xi's top anti-corruption body since October 2017. Zhao's family consisted of senior communist party officials, and he was able to enroll at the prestigious Peking University ahead of the end of the Cultural Revolution \u2014 an indication of his family's clout and influence within the CCP.Ties to Xi: Like Li Zhanshu, Zhao is known to be a member of the Xi clique. He served as party chief in Shaanxi province \u2014 Xi's ancestral home. Zhao is known to have close personal links to Xi's family and benefits from a long-standing friendship between his father and Xi's. He has also proved fiercely loyal to Xi and has helped the Chinese president reinforce an iron grip on full and strict Party governance.Han Zheng has ties to several past PSC membersHan Zheng worked as Xi's deputy in Shanghai, and earned a Politburo seat himself when Xi became the CCP's general secretary in 2012. Ding Haitao/Xinhua via Getty ImagesHan Zheng, 67, is the Deputy Party Secretary of the State and the first vice-premier of China. He was a career politician in Shanghai and became the city's youngest mayor at 48. He is considered to be one of the top economic shot-callers and a seasoned technocrat.AdvertisementTies to Xi: Han was mentored by Huang Ju, Wu Bangguo, Zhu Rongji, Zeng Qinghong, and Yu Zhengsheng \u2014 five of his patrons who all later served on the Politburo Standing Committee. Han later worked as Xi's deputy in Shanghai in 2007, before Xi became a member of the Politburo Standing Committee. Han then earned a Politburo seat himself when Xi became the CCP's general secretary in 2012.Interestingly, both professors Fewsmith and Shih expect Han to step down this fall, having passed the retirement age.\"He will retire and it will be an open question whether the Shanghai-line (of power), which started with Jiang Zemin, will continue to produce top-level officials,\" Shih told Insider.The outer circle. China's billionaire businessmen have plenty of clout, but they still lack access to XiJack Ma used to be one of China's most influential men \u2014 and while he still is a billionaire, his clout in China's elite has been significant reduced. With Ma having been made an example of, other Chinese billionaires have no choice but to toe the line. Elaine Thompson-Pool/Getty ImagesChina's rich list comprises individuals who have gained clout by building tech empires and pharmaceutical businesses worth billions. However, China's billionaires operate by different rules, particularly after the fall of Jack Ma. Xi's push toward \"common prosperity\" \u2014 the idea that the wealthy must share their good fortune with the poor \u2014 has changed the ways that China's richest operate. Xi vowed in 2021 to \"adjust the excessive incomes\" of China's crazy-rich and redistribute their wealth in a push for high-income enterprises to \"return more to society\" in the spirit of \"social fairness.\"Gone are the days of outspoken billionaires rocking out on stage in flamboyant outfits as Ma did back in 2019. These days, the ultra-rich toe the line and stay under the radar amid intense tech crackdowns, eager to not test Xi's patience and lose it all.China's richest man, Nongfu Spring Water's Zhong Shanshan, is nicknamed 'Lone Wolf'Nongfu Spring Water and pharmaceutical billionaire Zhong Shanshan VCG/Getty ImagesZhong, 67, is the chairman of Nongfu Spring Water and the owner of Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise. He also currently holds the title of China's richest man, with an estimated net worth of $66.2 billion.

The firm's fiery signature alcohol Kweichow Moutai is available on the platform for CNY3,599 a bottle (USD567), 20 percent less than the price charged by third-party dealers. But such is the demand, only three people out of every 10,000 who tried to buy it were successful.The subscription system uses blockchain-based depository technology, and the whole process is notarized by the Hangzhou Internet Notary Public Office, the Renhuai, southwestern Guizhou province-based company said. Successful participants can collect their purchases from Kweichow Moutai outlets or designated distributors.Kweichow Moutai sells most of its products through distributors, but it is now trying to shift more product through direct sales as it can get a higher price and improve its profit margin. For instance, the shipment price of the 500ml Feitian Moutai to distributors is CNY969 (USD153) a bottle, but it can ask for CNY1,499 for the same bottle through direct sales.With the launch of iMoutai, direct sales channels are likely to become one of Kweichow Moutai\u2019s growth drivers, market analysts said. The firm already cut the number of distributors by 632 from 2018 to 2020.Kweichow Moutai's direct sales gained 81 percent last year from the year before to CNY24 billion (USD3.8 billion), contributing 22.6 percent of the firm\u2019s total revenue last year, compared with 13.5 percent in 2020, according to the firm\u2019s latest earnings report released yesterday. This helped lift the company\u2019s gross profit margin in 2021 to 94.03 percent to 93.99 percent.Editor: Kim Taylor",

Shares of the \u201cCall of Duty\u201d game publisher are trading more than 15% below the software giant\u2019s cash offer of $95 per share - a bigger gap than is typical for such deals.

            "description": "April 03: To most people wine is only what\u2019s in the Glass but there is often history and several stories- especially with old wineries in Italy, Germany and France-especially Bordeaux Chateaux \u2013one of which is Ch\u00e2teau Loudenne which has recently been sold to Christophe Gouache through commercial court order. Our Bordeaux expert John Salvi MW who turns 85 on 6 April 2022, has a vast experience of the region and has been following Loudenne for over 60 years and shares the outline of its intriguing history and fascinating story in his own wordsIn 1957, when I was just 20 years old, my new boss, Allan Sichel, sent me to Bordeaux for 2 years to learn the trade. He owned the n\u00e9gociant company of Maison Sichel and a majority share of Ch\u00e2teau Palmer, which he had bought in 1938.My father who had had been in school with him and a lifelong friend, was a wine importer, distributor and retailer in London and Edinburgh as well as President of the Wine and Spirit Association of Great Britain. He knew most of the Bordeaux wine trade well and I was taken under the wings of Ronald Barton of L\u00e9oville Barton and Christian Cruse of Pontet Canet.In order to show me that good wine did not stop at Saint-Estephe and the Haut Medoc, Christian took me on a tour of the North Medoc, then known as the Bas Medoc. This included a visit to Ch\u00e2teau Loudenne since Christian was an Anglophile and Loudenne had belonged to the Gilbey family (famous for Gin) for nearly 100 years.In 1670, the aristocratic Verthamond de Marcellus family had installed themselves in the Medoc and built a Chartreuse (A manor house, built between 1650 and 1850, consisting of a single storey, often elongated, composed of exterior architectural elements and exquisite interior). This was bought 2 centuries later by Walter and Alfred Gilbey in 1875. In 1876 they built a brand-new Chai (pronounced \"shay\"- a French word for a wine storeroom-especially in Boardeaux and usually referred to an above-ground room) and enlarged it and embellished the Chartreuse.This was Ch\u00e2teau Loudenne, known as the Pink Chateau on the bank of River Gironde. At the time of my visit the wine was very ordinary and, from what I remember, the estate was in an advanced state of disrepair and the chateau uninhabitable.Some years later the Gilbey family sold the Chateau to International Distillers and Vintners (IDV) who were becoming major players in the fine wine trade in the UK. They decided to renovate the property and use it not only to make fine wine again but also as a center of hospitality where they could entertain their guests and customers. This was done on a grand scale and Loudenne was soon to become a beautiful chateau once more as well as a magnificent property. This corresponded with the period when the Chateaux of Bordeaux were once again blooming after an extended period in the doldrums.IDV had been formed in 1963 and was composed of three partners: Twiss, Browning & Hallowes (whose director, Geoffrey Hallowes, was a fervent supporter of Loudenne), Justerini & Brooks and Piat. Watneys bought IDV in 1970, but shortly afterwards Watneys was purchased by Grand Metropolitan whose Chairman, Sir Maxwell Joseph who wisely separated the wine and spirits from the beer business.When the restoration was almost finished, two senior members of IDV, Johnny Patrick and David Peppercorn, appointed a manager to run and oversee the property- Martin Bamford, who was my oldest and dearest friend from his days with Harvey\u2019s of Bristol. He installed himself in one of the turrets of the Chateau and set about turning Loudenne into a renowned and magnificent center of gracious living and hospitality.Sylvain and Josette Riondato hired as Major Domo and Chef three years earlier by Johnny helped him in the job. One of the first things Bamford did was to hire Hugh Johnson to re-design the already famous rose beds. He discovered that the Chateau had a magnificent cellar of fine old wines and used them liberally to accompany Josette\u2019s culinary creations.Loudenne rapidly became famous and entertained the great and the good, including Edward Heath, the British Prime Minister. The property of course became part of the massive empire of Maxwell Joseph who had an even more massive property in the Dordogne, became a firm supporter of Martin Bamford and all his projects for Loudenne and visited as often as possible.Professional hostesses were required to run such an establishment, to look after the guests and take care of the daily running of the property, which was now receiving guests on a grand scale. The first hostess was Riti TrippVan Staveren, a Dutch lady of decided opinions, authoritative manners, and a genius for organization. She pulled everything together until the daily routine of the chateau ran as smoothly as silk. (She died quite recently).Several years later she was replaced by Jacqueline Connolly, one of the most delightful persons imaginable. Her husband, Thurloe, was the architect who had masterminded the renovation of the property. He became a close friend of Bamford and between them they continued to embellish the chateau, notably doting it with a fine vintage kitchen with swan taps on the cauldrons of which they were immensely proud.Jacqueline was followed by Nicole Launay, a gentle and elegant lady who did not stay very long. The next one was a strong-minded Australian by the name of Priscilla Bonham-Carter who spent a lot of her time socializing with other local Chateau owners, some of them intimately. Then came Marie Christine Delorme, a feisty lady from Mexico who married Michael Longhurst, Bamford\u2019s Sales Director.After she left, Diana Ververka took over but stayed for a short time. Diana was followed by Luce Naval and eventually by Pamela Prior- the greatest hostess of them all. Pamela, who had been Bamford's secretary since May 1980, ran the property from May 1984 until May 1995 and became close friends with many of the guests and visitors. Today she is 86 and lives in Bordeaux.Bamford, who had been made President of IDV France with responsibility for Public Relations a year earlier, died suddenly in September 1982, on the eve of the Ban des Vendanges (Official date set by a decree that authorizes the start of the annual harvest). Maxwell had died just 2 days earlier the same week. Pamela was at Loudenne when Bamford died. She then worked for Jacques Bernard, who was made President of IDV France, until she was nominated Chatelaine (in charge of a large house) at Loudenne in 1984.Bamford was eventually replaced as Director of Loudenne by Charles Eve, who also replaced Pamela by Lucie Palmer. Charles and his wife Pat, together with Lucie Palmer, managed the property until it was finally sold to the Lafragette family in the year 2000.They owned several properties but got into financial difficulties due to fraud and were constrained to sell them all. This resulted in the sale, in 2013, to Moutai Kweichow. Moutai produces the world famed Moutai Baijiu and is the world\u2019s largest Spirit producer, overtaking Diageo in 2017. Despite their fame and fortune Moutai did not pay the staff and were uncontactable.In 2014 there was a scandal in the Medoc when 3 Chinese employees complained of non-payment, illegal dismissal, and other irregularities. Moutai contacted the Cognac house of Camus, who had looked after their duty-free sales and sales to many parts of the world of their baijiu for the past 10 years. In 2016 Camus took a share and in 2017 appointed a new manager Philippe de Poyferr\u00e9 to replace Guy Durand de Saint-Omer. Camus took over the responsibility for reorganizing the employees, renewing the vineyard, reviving the wine quality and redefining the fame and popularity of the brand of one of the loveliest Ch\u00e2teaux in the Medoc.Moutai belongs to the Guizhou Provincial People\u2019s Government and had great plans for the Ch\u00e2teaux. Together with Camus they would build a luxury hotel with 24 bedrooms, sell 50% of the wine in China, and use the Ch\u00e2teau to entertain on a grand scale. But the restraints by the Chinese Government made it impossible to implement the investment planned for the continuation of the winery.On 24 November, 2021, they were taken over by the Bordeaux Commercial Council, put into \u201cLiquidation Judiciaire\u201d and put up for sale. Nobody is certain why Moutai pulled the plug- perhaps because its chairman from 2011-18 was committed to prison for life for fraud. He, together with Zhong Huaili, Moutai\u2019s representative in France, was very keen to develop the wine business with plans to buy properties in other countries as well.The new owner, Christophe Gouache, who already owns both Ch\u00e2teaux Valeral and Bellerive, intends to move and live in the Medoc. Under him we can hope that the wine, which has recently been extremely poor, will regain it former quality and reputation. Now it is certified BIO.Cyril Camus says, \u201cit is not without a pinch of the heart that we will separate from Loudenne, but since our partner Moutai Kweichow has not been able to get the necessary permission to continue our investment as planned, there is no point in continuing.\u201dWill I ever eat, drink and sleep there again???John Salvi Master of WineChateau Loudenne is imported in India by Aspri Spirits and is available at Rs. 3380. Arun Kumar, Director of Aspri, says that though it is listed at the Delhi Duty Free fresh stocks have arrived and will be available in the DDF soon. You might want to pick up a bottle or two on your return from overseas and read the Article at leisure if you believe like we do-that wine is culture and history and much more than what\u2019s in the bottle.",

Le domaine a officiellement annonc\u00e9 la vente sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux, pour un montant non divulgu\u00e9.Le 24 novembre 2021, la situation financi\u00e8re difficile du domaine a \u00e9t\u00e9 officiellement r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e lorsqu\u2019il a fini par \u00eatre mis \u00e0 la vente par le tribunal de commerce de Bordeaux en raison de salaires et de factures impay\u00e9s. \u00c0 cette occasion, le domaine a invoqu\u00e9 comme principales causes les contraintes impos\u00e9es par le gouvernement chinois aux entreprises d'\u00c9tat comme Kweichow Moutai, rendant impossible la mise en \u0153uvre de plans d'investissement qui permettraient de poursuivre les activit\u00e9s du domaine.De grandes ambitionsSuite \u00e0 la transaction, Christophe Gouache a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : \u00ab le rachat de Loudenne est un projet familial aussi nous avons l\u2019intention de nous installer dans le M\u00e9doc. J\u2019en suis convaincu, la conversion en bio de Ch\u00e2teau Loudenne repr\u00e9sente un atout consid\u00e9rable afin de contribuer \u00e0 pr\u00e9server l\u2019environnement naturel du Ch\u00e2teau Loudenne et ses alentours, de procurer des conditions de travail saines \u00e0 nos salari\u00e9s et de proposer des produits respectueux de l\u2019environnement \u00e0 nos clients \u00bb. Le domaine, dont l\u2019histoire remonte \u00e0 plus de 350 ans, a \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9 par Moutai pour un montant estim\u00e9 \u00e0 20 millions d'euros \u00e0 la famille Lafragette en 2013. L\u2019achat est intervenu au moment o\u00f9 le fabricant de baijiu de luxe s\u2019essayait au commerce du vin, le gouvernement chinois ayant entam\u00e9 une politique de r\u00e9pression \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des ventes de baijiu de haut de gamme.Le ch\u00e2teau Loudenne, premier achat de vignoble pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de spiritueux la plus connue de Chine, devait incarner l'ambition croissante du g\u00e9ant des spiritueux d\u2019\u00e9laborer et d'importer des vins pour le march\u00e9 chinois en pleine expansion. Gr\u00e2ce au vaste r\u00e9seau commercial de Moutai et \u00e0 son actionnariat chinois, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 visait \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque \u00e0 revendre 50 % de ses vins sur le march\u00e9 chinois. Moutai a d\u2019ailleurs investi 5 millions d'euros dans la modernisation de la cave ainsi que 2 millions d'euros dans le d\u00e9veloppement de l'\u0153notourisme, son but avou\u00e9 \u00e9tant de positionner le ch\u00e2teau au premier rang des Crus Bourgeois.Disgr\u00e2ceAu final, le domaine a pein\u00e9 \u00e0 commercialiser ses vins sur le march\u00e9 chinois \u2013 seuls 10 % y \u00e9tant vendus \u2013 et \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper son rayonnement \u00e0 l'exportation. C\u2019est ce qu\u2019a constat\u00e9 son directeur Philippe de Poyferr\u00e9 lors d'une visite en 2019. Les ennuis ont suivi. Deux ans seulement apr\u00e8s le rachat, la cave a \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9e par trois employ\u00e9s chinois d'arri\u00e9r\u00e9s de salaire non pay\u00e9s et de rupture ill\u00e9gale de contrats, selon les m\u00e9dias fran\u00e7ais. \"Aucun salaire n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 impay\u00e9 et tous les fournisseurs vont \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9s int\u00e9gralement dans les semaines \u00e0 venir\" pr\u00e9cise Philippe de Poyferr\u00e9 suite \u00e0 la publication de cette article, ajoutant que \"la proc\u00e9dure via le tribunal de commerce a \u00e9t\u00e9 souhait\u00e9 par les actionnaires de Loudenne pour permettre de r\u00e9soudre une situation de blocages par l'administration Chinoise tout en prot\u00e9geant Loudenne, ses salari\u00e9s et ses fournisseurs\".La raison pour laquelle Moutai a finalement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de mettre fin au projet n'est pas claire, mais l'expansion viticole du groupe a \u00e9t\u00e9 orchestr\u00e9e sous l\u2019\u00e9gide de Yuan Renguo, aujourd'hui en disgr\u00e2ce.Le ch\u00e2teau Loudenne s'\u00e9tend sur 132 hectares, au c\u0153ur desquels s\u2019\u00e9rige un ch\u00e2teau de couleur rose datant du 17e si\u00e8cle. \u00c0 son apog\u00e9e, il a accueilli des sommit\u00e9s telles que Winston Churchill et la princesse Margaret de Grande-Bretagne.

At its height, the castle once hosted luminaries such as Winston Churchill and Princess Margaret of Britain.The winery just completed its organic conversion this year and its wines will be certified organic starting from the 2022 vintage.Chateau Loudenne (pic: Chateau Loudenne)Ch\u00e2teau Loudenne, the first vineyard purchase for China\u2019s most known liquor company, it was heralded as the liquor giant\u2019s growing ambition to produce and import wines for China\u2019s expanding wine market. With Moutai\u2019s vast sales network and Chinese ownership, the winery at the time aimed to sell 50% of its wines back to the Chinese market.The momentum as it seemed was unstoppable.Moutai further invested \u20ac5 million to modernize the winery and another \u20ac2 in developing wine tourism in a drive to turn the winery into the No.1 Crus Bourgeois estate, as it proclaimed.State-owned Kweichow Moutai is the world\u2019s most valuable liquor brand (pic: file image)Moutai\u2019s long-time partner cognac producer Camus later became a minority shareholder, and was tasked of Ch\u00e2teau Loudenne\u2019s wine sales in travel retail and key export markets such as USA, Japan and Singapore.But as the winery struggles to sell back the wines to the Chinese market \u2013 only 10% \u2013 and grow its export market reach, as told by estate manager Philippe de Poyferr\u00e9 during a 2019 visit, troubles followed.Just two years after the purchase, the winery was accused by three Chinese employees for unpaid back wages and illegal termination of contracts, according to local reports.On November 24 last year, the estate\u2019s dire financial situation was laid bare when it was eventually taken over by Bordeaux\u2019s commercial court and was put up for auction due to long overdue unpaid employee wages and other expenses.The winery at the time cited constraints placed by Chinese government on state-owned Chinese companies like Kweichow Moutai as the main cause, making it impossible to implement investment plans for the winery\u2019s continued operation.Chateau Loudenne is sold to the Gouache family, also owns Chateau Bellerive in Medoc and Chateau Valeyrac through Vignobles Gouache, for an undisclosed amount (pic: Chateau Loudenne Facebook)The winery formally announced the sale this week for an undisclosed amount on its social media. The new owner, the Gouache family, also owns Ch\u00e2teau Bellerive in Medoc and Ch\u00e2teau Valeyrac through Vignobles Gouache.Commenting on the purchase, Christophe Gouache says, \u201cthe purchase of Loudenne is a family project and we intend to settle in the Medoc. I am convinced that the conversion of Ch\u00e2teau Loudenne into bio is a considerable asset in order to help preserve the natural environment of Ch\u00e2teau Loudenne and its surroundings, to provide healthy working conditions for our employees and to offer environmentally friendly products to our customers. \u201cCyril Camus, the fifth-generation owner for Camus, commented, \u201cit is not without a pinch of heart that we will separate from Loudenne, but our partner Kweichow Moutai has not been able to get the necessary permission from the Chinese administration to continue our investment plan as planned\u2026 We are happy with this purchase because Mr. Gouache is willing to invest to finish positioning Ch\u00e2teau Loudenne as the reference of the M\u00e9doc. \u201cPhilippe de Poyferr\u00e9 who has joined Loudenne as estate manager since 2017 will remain in his post with the Gouache family.It\u2019s unclear why Moutai eventually pulled the plug on the project, but the group\u2019s wine expansion was orchestrated under now disgraced former head Yuan Renguo.Moutai hasn\u2019t issued an official statement on the sale yet.Like this: Like Loading...",

Now, the M\u00e9doc winery has found a new buyer.dChristophe Gouache (Left), new owner of Ch\u00e2teau LoudenneGeneral manager of Ch\u00e2teau Loudenne, Philippe de Poyferr\u00e9, announced on Linkedin four months ago that the winery had been placed into insolvency proceedings by the Bordeaux Commercial Court on 24 November 2021, due to long overdue employee wages and other expenses.In the same post, he claimed that Loudenne\u2019s former owner, Kweichow Moutai \u2013 China\u2019s most valuable publicly-listed company \u2013 faced certain \u201cconstraints regarding foreign transactions for Chinese state-owned enterprises\u201d , which meant the company was not authorised to continue its investment plan to redevelop the estate.As Moutai ducked out, investor partner Camus Cognac, former minority shareholder of Loudenne, followed accordingly.Last week, as reported by Anthocyanes, former accountant Christophe Gouache, owner of M\u00e9doc wineries Chateau Bellerive and Chateau Valeyrac, was announced as Loudenne\u2019s new buyer.Gouache said the purchase of Loudenne is a family project as he intends to settle in M\u00e9doc. He is intrigued by and is keen to support the organic and sustainable approach of Loudenne.Moutai purchased Chateau Loudenne in 2013 under the international expansion policy encouraged amongst China\u2019s state-owned enterprises at that time.Camus Cognac, long-standing distributor of Moutai in the Duty-Free markets, joined as a minority shareholder and took over the management of the winery in 2016.Over this period, Camus redeveloped the vineyard according to organic standards and rejuvenated the brand in the distribution network.Situated in Northern M\u00e9doc, Ch\u00e2teau Loudenne spans more than 132 hectares of which 62 are in operation.When Moutai purchased the winery, it had ambitious plans to create a luxury hotel within its grounds to attract tourists and invest \u20ac5 million into modernising the production facilities and equipment in order to make Loudenne a top winery amongst Crus Bourgeois.In 2015, Loudenne was brought to court for violating local labour laws, as it owed wages to three Chinese employees. The winery was accused of concealing work content, not paying overtime pay, and not complying with dismissal procedures, which caused a stir in the local area.",

            "description": "Digital transformation is all the craze in China. Even the venerable Kweichow Moutai distillery now talks of the new digital processes necessary to brew a smarter liquor. But all of this only reflects the popularization of a long-running Communist Party initiative of far greater strategic significance. Over the past two decades, General Secretary Xi Jinping has been at the center of party efforts to create a comprehensive digital strategy of immense proportions, known as Building Digital China (\u5efa\u8bbe\u6570\u5b57\u4e2d\u56fd), or more often simply Digital China. While sounding much like an industrial strategy, Digital China is never described as such internally. In broadest terms, it is a major strategic decision made by Xi Jinping in the aftermath of the 18th Party Congress in 2012 to digitally transform the nation. For the more technically minded, it is the overall strategy for national informatized development in the new era. Although mostly unknown in the West, Digital China has enormous implications for China\u2019s developmental path, great-power competition, and the norms that will undergird the international system for decades to come.As a concept personally tied to Xi, one might argue that not only has he made Digital China a key to national success, but that Digital China has also contributed to his individual success, as the concept has tracked his rise for more than two decades. Xi first adopted the precursor concept of Digital Fujian from a local academic while serving as deputy party secretary and governor of that province in 2000. It was originally conceived as a simple effort to use new and emerging digital technologies to improve local governance and improve economic efficiency \u2014 in essence, China\u2019s first experiments in e-government. Xi Jinping\u2019s Digital Fujian would evolve and expand over the next 20 years before finally reemerging as the party\u2019s vision for a fully informatized Digital China: a sharp weapon that empowers the nation (improved national competitiveness) and a spring rain that benefits the people (improved operating efficiency of society).New Type InfrastructureSurprisingly, a strategic initiative of this size and scope has progressed mostly unnoticed in the West. Perhaps more surprising, even the most concrete elements of the strategy remain obscure outside China. At the onset of the pandemic, Xi Jinping directed the Communist Party to accelerate an infrastructure campaign of epic proportions in support of Building Digital China. This campaign, known in China as New Type Infrastructure (\u65b0\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd), is to receive an estimated 17.5 trillion yuan (nearly $2.7 trillion) over five years exclusively for the purpose of digitally transforming traditional infrastructure and building new digital infrastructure. As outlined in April 2020 by the National Development and Reform Commission, the state\u2019s top macroeconomic planning authority, New Type Infrastructure falls into multiple levels and categories including the construction of an industrial internet, the building of a national dual gigabit network (integrated 5G mobile and fixed gigabit optical), the building of a satellite internet network, as well as the recent official launch of nationally integrated system of big-data centers. More broadly, Beijing describes the campaign as becoming the key support and important material guarantee for a new revolution in science and technology and a new round of industrial transformation. Simply stated, this plan is a pivotal part of China\u2019s effort to dominate the Fourth Industrial Revolution.Beijing also believes that the technology, manufacturing, and domestic subscribers arising from New Type Infrastructure will drive mutually reinforcing growth in China\u2019s international trade and inward investment, a competitive trajectory and exemplar of the Communist Party\u2019s new dual-circulation economic strategy. Xi introduced building a new development pattern based on dual circulation between domestic and international markets at a Politburo meeting in May 2020. Designed to respond in the short term to structural changes impeding China\u2019s economic development, principally COVID-19 and barriers to high-technology imports, the pattern calls for a primary focus on the innovative expansion of China\u2019s domestic economy, which in a hardening external environment would also serve as the principal driver for China\u2019s continued access and expansion into international markets, in effect dual circulation. Former Vice Commerce Minister Wei Jianguo went so far as to describe New Type Infrastructure as core to building the dual-circulation new development pattern and further linked Xi\u2019s vision to accelerate New Type Infrastructure construction using the strategic window opened by the COVID-19 pandemic to the origins of the dual-circulation concept itself.Building Digital ChinaDigital China, like all of the country\u2019s national-level strategies in general, is built on Communist Party decisions, objectives, missions, projects, and priority areas of action \u2014 to name just a few. New Type Infrastructure is one of Digital China\u2019s major mission s , one of three focused specifically on developing core technologies. To use Communist Party nomenclature for strategy construction, building a National Information Infrastructure System, composed of New Type Infrastructure\u2019s three main directions \u2014 information infrastructure (\u4fe1\u606f\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd), integrated infrastructure (\u878d\u5408\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd], and innovative infrastructure (\u521b\u65b0\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd) \u2014 is a major mission designed to support national informatization. To borrow Western nomenclature for strategy construction, New Type Infrastructure is simply one of the means, or in this case one of the system-level technical resources, required for Building Digital China. Two other system-level technical means are also required. The second major technology mission, closely tied to the New Type Infrastructure mission, is the elevation of the nation\u2019s Information Technology Industrial Ecosystem (\u4fe1\u606f\u6280\u672f\u4ea7\u4e1a\u751f\u6001\u4f53\u7cfb). Elevating this ecosystem, which will provide the traction for national informatization, parallels Xi\u2019s drive to increase China\u2019s innovative capabilities, and overlaps with two key focus areas, mastering core technologies and collecting cyber talent, from one of Digital China\u2019s cornerstone strategies: cyber great power. The third major technology mission is the development of a Data Element Resource System (\u6570\u636e\u8981\u7d20\u8d44\u6e90\u4f53\u7cfb), a system described as core to the nation\u2019s informatization effort and the focal point for the party\u2019s overwhelming interest in data governance and control. Together, these three missions will supply the technical and systemic means, however difficult to achieve, that have been deemed necessary to realize Xi\u2019s digital vision for the nation.While the technical missions of Digital China are grand, the socioeconomic and geopolitical scope of Digital China is breathtaking. Marxist theorists routinely characterize the developmental components of Digital China, or to borrow Western strategy nomenclature once again, the ways of Digital China, as nothing less than the digital transformation of China\u2019s path to national rejuvenation. As recently as the 14th Five-Year Plan, released just one year ago, Digital China\u2019s five ways were mapped to the Communist Party\u2019s five-sphere integrated plan (\u4e94\u4f4d\u4e00\u4f53), the overall plan for building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Significantly, each of the traditional spheres was also digitally transformed for coordination and advancement under Digital China: digital economy, e-government, digital culture, smart society, and digital ecology. In short, achieving national informatization, the primary objective of Building Digital China, has become fundamental, guiding work necessary to achieve the national rejuvenation of a modern, socialist great power. Geopolitically, Digital China\u2019s success would now be measured, among other markers, by a fully informatized smart society acting as a developmental model globally and a digital rule-setter internationally. A successful Digital China will also stand as a digital great power with global dominance in multiple strategic domains including cyber, manufacturing, transportation and logistics, and science and technology. In short, Communist Party leaders see Digital China as a transformative-competitive win-win.In a paper to be published soon by the Texas National Security Review, my co-author, John Hemmings , and I draw from the two-decade trail of Communist Party commentary, government documents, and state-run media reports to outline the history, structure, and objectives of Digital China, its technology missions including New Type Infrastructure, as well as the developmental and geopolitical ends it is designed to achieve. While we note that there is already notable literature in the West on Chinese industrial and technology policies and their ideological underpinnings, we make what we think are two original contributions to the literature. The first of these is that there is an overall strategy driving a coordinated party approach to interrelated technology projects like artificial intelligence, societal programs like smart cities, and national strategies like digital economy, and so on \u2014 that it is called Digital China \u2014 and that it has gradually and almost imperceptibly become the party\u2019s voice and strategy to drive Xi Jinping\u2019s decades-old vision for digital transformation. The second argument is that the Communist Party\u2019s approach to technology has been framed by Marxist thought \u2014 not incidentally, but deliberately. The governance and control of data within an informatized system is a key focal point of Digital China. But this new approach to data also required using historical materialism to justify an ostensibly Marxist economic system that had elevated data, not labor, as the key factor of production. In December 2017, Xi Jinping was the first party leader to publicly describe data as the key factor of production in a digital economy, effectively rewriting Marx\u2019s labor theory of value at the highest level. The idea would churn in the party system until April 2020 when the Central Committee and State Council jointly published an opinion on the market allocation of factors of production, specifically adding data as a new factor of production for the first time, joining Marx\u2019s labor, land, capital, and technology.Challenges and ImplicationsMuch (and perhaps most) of the original source material on Digital China remains untranslated. This may explain, in part, why these two concepts, Digital China and New Type Infrastructure, remain obscure outside China, particularly when both are a near continuous presence in China\u2019s state-run media and the subject of repeated public education campaigns for party cadre and Chinese citizens. We believe part of the problem is also due to the evolutionary nature of Chinese strategy development, with key concepts and terminology morphing and continuing to morph as Communist Party knowledge, experimentation, and comfort deepens. Just as important perhaps is the sheer difficulty of Chinese technical translation, particularly with writers who are often more theorist than engineer taking the lead. Finally, there is evidence of obfuscation and mistranslation of key Digital China concepts in the official English-language translations of government documents. Although perhaps reflecting only inattention by translators, we believe the evidence points elsewhere. All of these challenges to analysis outside China point to our first recommendation: the overwhelming importance of a coordinated, multinational approach to translation and analysis on the topic of Digital China and all its subcomponents, a library of documents that would overwhelm any single translation effort and fracture any possibility of corporate analysis and understanding. The time to start this is now.Concurrently, we can also begin to try to model the downstream implications for liberal democracies that would flow from a fully successful Digital China. By party definition, Digital China will increasingly drive Beijing\u2019s competitive strategy against the United States and its partners. The across-the-board transformation of Beijing\u2019s manufacturing industries, its society, governance model, and innovation are couched in terms of domestic and geopolitical outcomes. The United States and its partners \u2014 though weary of decoupling from what might become the world\u2019s largest economy \u2014 must weigh the interests from a democratic and geopolitical perspective. One clear challenge even now is how new disruptive technologies \u2014 like artificial intelligence and informatized societies \u2014 are empowering innovative attempts at authoritarianism. While Digital China includes industrial goals, there is also clear party direction to transform society and the ways that Chinese citizens are governed by the party. This is not simply perfecting tools that already exist. Instead, this is developing innovative new tools that will be tested as pilot projects in localities across China. While not all the ideas will be bad, it is clear that all of them will be executed through the lens of an authoritarian system.A second implication arises from the first: As China is \u2014 by many calculations \u2014 predicted to surpass the United States in any number of measures (or come close to surpassing the United States) in coming decades, democratic nations are confronted by the possibility of the world\u2019s first authoritarian hegemonic power. Technologies associated with Digital China, their manufacture and standards, and how they integrate data into forms of control, should be of immense concern to those states that continue to prize political and individual rights. Digital China\u2019s technology projects are highly integrated at both the national and the global level, and Beijing intends to export its technical standards, its network architecture, and the governance model implicit in those. As an early indicator, Beijing has already expressed interest in the gradual deployment of data centers in support of Digital China\u2019s industrial internet to countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative. As mentioned earlier, the Communist Party\u2019s approach to data is both Marxist and authoritarian in nature and exerts a sort of totality of control over individuals that could ultimately impact nations enticed by Digital China\u2019s New Type Infrastructure.What\u2019s Next?Following the 18th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, General Secretary Xi Jinping made a major strategic decision to launch Building Digital China with a focus on the future. This entails the construction of major digital infrastructure networks across the nation as well as a nationwide system to govern and control data. Its intent is growing China\u2019s digital economy, strengthening and informatizing its governance, updating and promoting its manufacturing, bolstering its innovative ecosystem, and enabling its leadership to shape global digital governance. With New Type Infrastructure as a primary technology mission, Digital China has incrementally become China\u2019s overall strategy for national informatization, evolving from its humble roots as a provincial-level strategy in the early 2000s. Now, it is openly linked to Xi Jinping, facilitating his national economic strategies both digital and dual circulation, as well as transforming China\u2019s path to national rejuvenation. The question, of course, for liberal democracies will be how much it fuels China\u2019s own rise to hegemonic status in the international system and the downstream consequences this might have on their own national interests.There is a clear and pressing need for an expanded research agenda on Digital China. We must not only analyze its ambitions, but tally the resources being put into it, as well as assess its likely success in achieving the Communist Party\u2019s stated objectives. We must also begin to understand its likely impact on the global standards of digital technologies and on our own national economies and societies. And ultimately, as we have sought to do when faced with the dangers of other historic authoritarian challengers, we must rise to the occasion and find ways to outcompete and outlive it. This begins with our own understanding of Digital China, of New Type Infrastructure, and of the Communist Party\u2019s vision for the governance and control of data.Let\u2019s begin now.David Dorman is a retired U.S. government China specialist.

            "description": "LONDON, March 31 (Reuters Breakingviews) - It\u2019s usually better to be a wealth manager than their client. That\u2019s definitely the case for Brewin Dolphin (BRW.L), which has just accepted a 1.6 billion pound ($2.1 billion) takeover from Canadian giant Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO). That\u2019s equivalent to a whopping 62% premium, and valued Brewin at nearly 3% of its assets under management.The rich price suggests some heavy lifting. To justify the roughly 600 million pound premium, RBC would need to take out over 20% of last year\u2019s costs, according to a Breakingviews calculation which values synergies on a multiple of 10. Yet RBC\u2019s existing UK wealth management business is small, limiting overlap. There may be some areas to grow revenues: say by offering Brewin clients banking products or access to RBC\u2019s research. Still, RBC\u2019s plan for 9% revenue growth looks bold next to analysts\u2019 6% forecasts for Brewin over the next three years, according to Refinitiv data.Still, the UK wealth management sector is attractive to foreign buyers: it is relatively fragmented and growing quickly as punters take greater control of their savings. The 12% bump in the share price of rival Rathbones (RAT.L) on Thursday suggests more deals may come.

            "description": "Physicochemical properties of biocharThe scanning electron microscope images of different biochar are shown in Fig. 1. The increasing carbonization temperature brings more obvious block layering and increases pore structure to biochar. The higher temperature leads to more organic matter decomposing in SS, which makes the biochar appear many micropores in the structure, resulting in the loose layering of the biochar40. It shows that high carbonization temperature is beneficial to improve the SSA of biochar. From the physicochemical properties of SSB in Table 1, SSB300 has the highest average pore volume. Affected by the total pore volume, SSB600 has the highest SSA, and SSB300 has the lowest. The result coincides with the inference of the scanning electron microscope image.Figure 1 Scanning electron micrograph of biochar at different carbonization temperatures. Full size imageTable 1 The physicochemical properties of sorghum straw biochar. Full size tableFrom the analysis data in Table 1, SSB300 has the highest content of carboxyl, lactone, phenolic hydroxyl and carbonyl group, followed by SSB450 and SSB600. It is proved that the acidic functional groups can characterize hydrophilicity and ion exchange capacity gradually decrease with the increase of carbonization temperature41. Therefore, from the perspective of acidic oxygen-containing functional groups, SSB300 is more conducive to adsorption.The infrared spectrum of SS and SSB are showed in Fig. 2. The absorption peak near 3417 cm\u22121 is the \u2013OH stretching vibration absorption peak42. The absorption peak gradually decreases with the increase of carbonization temperature. The increase of carbonization temperature improves the loss of hydroxyl during the pyrolysis process, thereby reducing the polarity of biochar. The absorption peaks near 2852 cm\u22121 and 2919 cm\u22121 are C\u2013H symmetry and anti-symmetric stretching vibration absorption peaks of the methyl group in the alkyl group and the methylene group43. The absorption peak gradually decreases with the increase of carbonization temperature, proving that carbonization temperature is proportional to the aromaticity of biochar. The absorption peaks near 1714 cm\u22121 and 1100 cm\u22121 are the C=O in the carboxyl group and the CO stretching vibration absorption peak in the ester group44. As the carbonization temperature increases, these absorption peaks gradually decreases, proving that the polarity of biochar gradually decreases. The absorption peak near 1596 cm\u22121 is the stretching vibration absorption peak of C=C on the aromatic ring and C=O in the carbonyl group45. As the carbonization temperature increases, the peak gradually weakens. It may be that the carbonyl group in biochar is destroyed by high temperatures to generate CO and CO 2 46 The absorption peak near 875 cm\u22121 is the C\u2013H flexural vibration absorption peak on the aromatic ring47. The absorption peak gradually increases with the increase of carbonization temperature, indicating that the stability and aromaticity of biochar are stronger. Therefore, from the analysis of infrared spectroscopy, the biochar contains a lot of oxygen-containing functional groups such as OH, COOH, and C=O, which gradually decreases as the carbonization temperature increases. The biochar pyrolyzes at low temperature is more conducive to adsorption, which is consistent with the results of oxygen-containing functional groups.Figure 2 Infrared spectra of sorghum straw and its biochar. Full size imageAdsorption influencing factorsCarbonization temperatureFrom Fig. 3, SSB300 had the highest adsorption capacity for ammonium, and the adsorption capacity and adsorption rate were 3.45 mg/g and 16.8%, respectively. SS had the smallest adsorption capacity (0.321 mg/g). Overall, the adsorption capacity was in the order of SSB300 > SSB450 > SSB600 > SS. As carbonization temperature increased, the adsorption of ammonium by SSB had a downward trend. SS also had certain adsorption of ammonium, but its adsorption performance was much lower than SSB. Although SSB300 had the smallest SSA, it had the largest content of acidic oxygen-containing functional groups and stronger ion exchange capacity, which made the SSB300 had the largest adsorption of ammonium in water.Figure 3 The adsorption capacity of biochar and sorghum straw for ammonium at different carbonization temperatures. Full size imageAdsorbent dosageAs shown in Fig. 4, with an increase of dosage, the adsorption capacity of SSB300 and SS for ammonium showed a downward trend, while the adsorption rates were upward. It was because as the amount of adsorbent increased, the SSA and adsorption pores of the adsorbent increased, thereby increasing the adsorption rate of ammonium. When the dosage of adsorbent was less than 0.1000 g, the ammonium adsorption rates of SSB300 and SS rose fast. When it exceeded 0.1000 g, the increasing trend was gentle, which indicated that more adsorbents can\u2019t effectively adsorb the ammonium in the water. Therefore, 0.1000 g was chosen as the optimal dosage for the test of SS and SSB to adsorb ammonium in water.Figure 4 The effect of dosage on ammonium adsorption. Full size imageSolution pHThe adsorption effect of ammonium is greatly affected by pH48. As shown in Fig. 5, when pH < 10, the ammonium adsorption capacity of SSB300 and SS rose with the increase of pH. Especially when the pH was 6\u201310, the adsorption capacity improved fast. When pH > 10, the adsorption of ammonium onto SSB300 and SS gradually decreased. The analysis believed that under acidic conditions, H+ facilitated the development of NH 3 \u00b7H 2 O ionization equilibrium toward NH 4 +, thereby enhancing the adsorption of ammonium. But as the pH decreased, too much H+ in the solution would bring competition to the adsorption of NH 4 +, inhibiting the adsorption of ammonium35. Under strong alkaline conditions (pH > 10), too much OH\u2212 inhibited the ionization balance of NH 3 \u00b7H 2 O, resulting in a decrease of NH 4 + in the solution, thereby reducing the adsorption of ammonium. In addition, when pH > 10, a part of ammonium volatilized in gaseous form. Therefore, the optimal pH of SSB300 and SS for ammonium adsorption was in the range of neutral and slightly acidic to slightly alkaline (6 ~ 10). Considering the uniformity of the subsequent actual sewage treatment control test conditions, pH = 7 was selected for subsequent experiments.Figure 5 The effect of pH on ammonium adsorption. Full size imageAdsorption kineticsThe intraparticle diffusion model, the pseudo-first-order kinetic model and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model were used to fit the experimental data. The equations were shown in (1) ~ (3). The fitting curve was shown in Fig. 6, and the fitting parameters were shown in Table 2.$${\\text{Intraparticle diffusion model}}:q_{t} = k_{1} t^{1/2} + C$$ (1)$${\\text{Pseudo-first-order kinetic model: }}q_{t} = q_{e} (1-e^{-kt}_{2})$$ (2)$${\\text{Pseudo-second-order kineticmodel}}:\\frac{t}{{q_{t} }} = \\frac{1}{{k_{3} q_{e}^{2} }} + \\frac{t}{{q_{e} }}$$ (3)where q t represents the adsorption capacity of ammonium at time t, mg/g. q e is the adsorption capacity of ammonium at adsorption equilibrium, mg/g. k 1 , k 2 , k 3 are adsorption rate constants; C is a constant.Figure 6 Ammonium adsorption kinetics fitting curve. Full size imageTable 2 Fitting parameters of ammonium adsorption kinetics. Full size tableAs shown in Table 2 and Fig. 6, the correlation coefficient R2 of the pseudo-second-order kinetic model was the highest, and the R2 of SSB300 was higher than that of SS. The theoretical equilibrium adsorption capacities were 3.55 and 0.375 mg/g respectively, which were very close to the actual saturated adsorption capacities (3.68 and 0.388 mg/g). Therefore, the pseudo-second-order kinetic model was more consistent with the adsorption process of SS and SSB300 on ammonium in water.From the perspective of the particle diffusion model, the adsorption process of SS and SSB300 on ammonium in water could be roughly divided into two stages. The first 3 h was the process of rapid adsorption of ammonium onto the surface of the adsorbent. Phase 2: After 3 h ammonium diffused slowly into the adsorbent. Due to the influence of molecular diffusion resistance, the diffusion rate within the adsorption decreased until the adsorption tended to balance. This stage was the rate-controlling stage of ammonium adsorption. Due to C \u2260 0, it indicated that intra-particle diffusion was not the only speed control step, meaning that the fitting curve was not at the origin49. The adsorption rate might be controlled by surface adsorption and intra-particle diffusion50,51.Adsorption isothermsThe Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm adsorption models were fitted to the adsorption test data at 25, 35, and 45 \u00b0C. The fitting curves were shown in Figs. 7 and 8, respectively, and the fitting parameters were shown in Table 3. The equations of the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm adsorption models were as follows:$${\\text{Freundlich model}}:q_{e} = k_{F} C_{e}^{1/n}$$ (4)Figure 7 The adsorption thermodynamic isotherm of ammonium (Freundlich). Full size imageFigure 8 The adsorption thermodynamic isotherm of ammonium (Langmuir). Full size imageTable 3 Isothermal adsorption fitting parameters of ammonium. Full size table$$\\text{Langmuir model}: {q}_{e}=\\frac{{q}_{m}{k}_{L}{C}_{e}}{1+{k}_{L}{C}_{e}}$$ (5)In the above formula, q m is the theoretical maximum adsorption capacity of ammonium, mg/g. C e is the concentration of ammonium in the solution at adsorption equilibrium, mg/L. k F , k L , n are isotherm constants.As shown in Table 3, Figs. 7 and 8, the correlation coefficient R2 of the Langmuir isotherm adsorption model was higher than that of the Freundlich isotherm adsorption model, proving that the Langmuir isotherm adsorption model was more in line with the thermodynamic adsorption behavior of SS and SSB300 for ammonium in water. And they were mainly monolayer adsorption. At 25, 35, and 45 \u00b0C, the maximum adsorption capacity of SSB300 for ammonium was 6.77, 6.97, and 7.09 mg/g, respectively, which was equivalent to 8.65, 8.64, and 7.60 times of SS. Compared with other adsorbents, SSB300 in this study showed a high ammonium adsorption capacity (Table 4). This difference was mainly attributed to the differences in physical and chemical properties between different biochar.Table 4 A comparison of the adsorption capacities of other adsorbents for ammonium. Full size tableIn addition, the separation factor R L was used to judge the adsorption effectiveness of the adsorbent56. The equation was:$${\\text{Separation factor}: R}_{L}=\\frac{1}{1+{k}_{L}{C}_{0}}$$ (6)C 0 \u2013The initial concentration of ammonium in the solution, mg/L.Among them, R L = 0 is irreversible adsorption. 0 < R L < 1 is favorable adsorption. R L = 1 is linear adsorption.From Table 3, the R L of SS and SSB300 at the three temperatures was all greater than 0 but less than 1, indicating that the SS and SSB had favorable adsorption of ammonium in water.Adsorption thermodynamicsJudging from the isotherm adsorption models of SS and SS300 at 3 temperatures, the adsorption capacity gradually increased as the temperature improved. To further study the thermodynamic behavior of adsorption, the Gibbs free energy change, enthalpy change and entropy change were analyzed according to the Langmuir isotherm adsorption model parameters in Table 3. The calculation formula was as follows:$$\\Delta G^{\\theta } = - RT\\ln K_{L}^{\\theta } = \\Delta H^{\\theta } - TS^{\\theta }$$ (7)$$\\ln K_{L}^{\\theta } = \\frac{{\\Delta S^{\\theta } }}{R} - \\frac{{\\Delta H^{\\theta } }}{RT}$$ (8)In the above formula, \u25b3G\u03b8 is Gibbs free energy change, kJ/mol. \u25b3H\u03b8 is enthalpy change, kJ/mol. \u25b3S\u03b8 is entropy change, kJ/mol. R is gas constant, J/mol\u00b7K. K L \u03b8 is the standard equilibrium constant, that is, the Langmuir isotherm adsorption model empirical equilibrium constant after standard concentration correction, dimensionless.The Gibbs free energy change, enthalpy change and entropy change calculated by formulas (7) and (8) are shown in Table 5.Table 5 The adsorption thermodynamic parameters of ammonium. Full size tableFrom the results in Table 5, \u25b3G\u03b8 < 0, showed that the adsorption process of SS and SSB to ammonium in water was spontaneous. The \u25b3H\u03b8 of SS and SS300 were both less than 0, indicating that the adsorption process of SS and SSB to ammonium in water was exothermic.Adsorption mechanismsAccording to the results of BET, FTIR and SEM analysis of SSB, the biochar with higher carbonization temperature had higher SSA and pore volume. However, adsorption results showed that biochar with low carbonization temperature had the best adsorption effect on ammonium in water. Through the analysis of the oxygen-containing functional group test results and the FTIR diagram of the biochar, it was found that the biochar with lower carbonization temperature contained more oxygen-containing functional groups, which was more conducive to the adsorption of ammonium. This analysis result was consistent with the actual adsorption results. It proved that the adsorption of SSB to ammonium in water was not simply physical adsorption, but a complex physical and chemical adsorption process dominated by chemical adsorption51. From the perspective of adsorption kinetics, the adsorption process was more in line with pseudo-second-order kinetics, which was consistent with the mechanism of clay/biochar composite adsorption particles on ammonium33. From the perspective of isothermal adsorption, the Langmuir isotherm adsorption model was more consistent with the adsorption behavior of SS and SSB on ammonium in water, which was consistent with the adsorption mechanism of food waste-based biochar on ammonium in water30. The thermodynamic analysis proved that the adsorption process was mainly chemical adsorption, which was a spontaneous and exothermic process.Regeneration performanceTo investigate the regeneration performance of SS and SS300 after adsorbing ammonium, they were regenerated with HCl and H 2 SO 4 solutions respectively. The adsorption effect after regeneration was shown in Fig. 9. The adsorption capacity of SS and SS300 after regeneration by HCl solution was higher than that of H 2 SO 4 solution. With repeated experiments of adsorption-regeneration, the first 3 adsorption-regeneration cycles of SS300 changed slightly. It was determined that the optimal number of regenerations of SS300 under the condition of HCl solution was 3, and the equilibrium adsorption capacity after regeneration was 82.1% of the initial adsorption capacity. Since the adsorption capacity of SS was very small, the adsorption capacity became extremely low after the first adsorption-regeneration cycle. Therefore, the regeneration performance of SS after adsorbing ammonium was extremely low, while the SSB had good regeneration performance after adsorbing ammonium.",

(pic: Caixin)Yuan Renguo, who served as Chairman of Kweichow Moutai from 2011 to 2018, was arrested in 2019 on corruption charges and was found guilty of taking bribes of RMB 112 million (US$17.2 million) between 1994 and 2018, but the scale and depth of his corruption were not revealed until China\u2019s top prosecutor recounted what it calls \u201cshocking\u201d details in a recent WeChat post.According to authorities, Yuan leveraged his position to take large amount of bribes and assisted his cronies and associates in securing much-coveted Moutai distribution deals and prized allocations.Moutai, being the most sought-after liquor inside China, was carefully distributed and tightly allocated due to its blistering market demand.It promoted local government in its home province Guizhou to cap its flagship \u2018Feitian\u2019 or \u2018Flying Fair\u2019s price at RMB 1500 (US$235), but it often sells for RMB 3000 a bottle in secondary market, and is still \u201chard to come by\u201d, according to media reports. Vintage Moutai from 1950s can fetch a quarter of a million at auctions.According to anti-graft officers, it took 44 officers to list out more than 1,588 items of bribes taken by Yuan including gold products, watches, jewelry, luxury handbags, paintings and among others.A 5kg pure gold Ding or drinking vessel was gifted to Yuan (pic: screen grab)In one of the most bizarre cases, Yuan was gifted by a crony a 5kg pure gold Ding \uff08\u9f0e\uff09, a Chinese cauldron or drinking vessel with personalized inscription of his given name (\u4ec1\u56fd).It was also revealed that his wife and daughter have profited RMB 230 million (US$36 million) from illegal Moutai sales since 2004.Yuan\u2019s arrest in 2019 triggered a wider anti-corruption crackdown within the state-owned distillery and local government in Guizhou. One of Yuan\u2019s close contact in local government, Wang Xiaoguang, vice governor of Guizhou, was found to have secured distribution deals with Moutai for his family and relatives, thanks to his connection to Yuan, profiting RMB 40 million (US$6.2 million) over 7 years.Strikingly, to the shock of anti-graft officers, one of Wang\u2019s rooms was stuffed with more than 4000 bottles of Moutai. For fear of corruption investigation, Wang even poured bottles of vintage Moutai into sewage to destroy evidence before his arrest.Wang was sentenced to 20 years in prison and slapped with RMB 173 million in fine.Moutai, the fiery Chinese baijiu, is the most sought-after spirits brand in China (pic: stock image)Like Champagne, Moutai is only produced in the Moutai town of Guizhou in southwestern China and more precisely, only baijiu made in Moutai town by Kweichow Moutai can be called Moutai.Made from red sorghum, the transparent liquor of Moutai was the tipple of choice by China\u2019s revolutionaries including Chairman Mao Zedong and the country\u2019s first premier Zhou Enlai. Its fiery strength stumped US president Richard Nixon on his first trip to China in 1972.It\u2019s often the drink of choice at banquets and business meetings, and its market value overtook Diageo in 2017 to become the world\u2019s most valuable spirit brand.Like this: Like Loading...",

            "description": "Originally conceptualised as a simple \"withdraw\" vs \"remain\" list, the list of companies commensurate with their involvement with Russia, now consists of five categories. These are:\u2022 Withdrawal - companies that have made a clean break with the country, that have completely halted their engagements with Russia and/or have exited the country.\u2022 Suspension - companies that have kept their options open for return. These are companies that are temporarily curtailing operations while keeping return-options open.\u2022 Scaling back - companies that are reducing activities. These are companies that are scaling back some business operations while continuing others.\u2022 Buying time - companies that are holding off new investments or developments. These are companies that are postponing future planned investment, development or marketing while continuing substantive business.\u2022 Digging in - companies that are defying demands for exit. These are companies that are defying demands to exit Russia or to reduce their activities,Download the list of these companies by clicking here.The list is updated continuously by Jeffrey Sonnenfeld and his team of experts, research fellows, and students at the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute to reflect new announcements from companies in as close to real time as possible.The list has already garnered extensive coverage for its role in helping catalyse the mass corporate exodus from Russia.When this list was first published the week of 28 February, only several dozen companies had announced their departure.\"Hundreds of companies have withdrawn in the days since, and we are humbled that our list helped galvanise millions around the world to raise awareness and take action,\" a spokesperson from the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute said.\"Although we are pleased that our list has been widely circulated across company boardrooms, government officials, and media outlets as the most authoritative and comprehensive record of this powerful, historic movement, we are most inspired by the thousands of messages we have received from readers across the globe, especially those from Ukraine, and we continue to welcome your tips, insights, and feedback.\"As of 20 April 2022 - see updated list here.Companies that are just continuing business-as-usual in Russia...Name Action Industry CountryAalberts still operating in Russia Industrials NetherlandsAB InBev still operating in Russia Consumer Staples BelgiumAcerinox still operating in Russia Materials SpainAgrana continue operating plant in Russia AustriaAgricultural Bank of China Russian companies open accounts with the bank;

            "description": "Don't talk to me until I've read Capital Caff: Your guide to the latest in coffee happenings around Beijing.I\u2019m an ambivert, an extrovert who benefits from the right dosage of solitude every now and then. Sometimes, I ditch the socials and just\u2026 take myself on a coffee date.Yeah, I know. How convenient for my article! But I really do, and of course it\u2019s not really just about the coffee. The coffee, dear reader, is the means to an end.Well, in this exciting episode of Capital Caff, I paid a visit to C+\u5496\u5561, a spiffy establishment in the 798/Dashanzi area. Their patio screams \u201ccaf\u00e9\u201d with their large sculptures and d\u00e9cor, while their indoors whisper \u201cbar\u201d. The duality shows in their English name, C+ Caf\u00e9 and Bar.If you do want to chill outside, their heated igloos are the way to go at this time of the year. I stayed inside, beckoned by the swish of the cocktail shaker and the jazzy tunes. Clean lines, round arches, subdued green and orange lights, artfully displayed cherry blossoms twigs make the spot's interior a nice place to be.Wanna know how fancy this place is? Even drinking water came in a repurposed Citadelle Gin bottle. C+ Caf\u00e9 & Bar has a VIP membership to make the most of their drink menu, with deals on alcoholic and non-alcoholic options alike. My choice was highlighted in a separate card on the counter -- their Moutai Latte (\u8305\u53f0\u62ff\u94c1, M\u00e1ot\u00e1i n\u00e1ti\u011b, RMB 88).New to Chinese culture? Moutai is a style of baijiu (\u767d\u9152, literally \u201cwhite clear liquor\u201d), produced in the town of Maotai (Guizhou province). The origins of Moutai trace back to the Qing Dynasty (1644\u20131912) and reach the Chinese Civil War (1927-1949), when the People\u2019s Liberation Army partook in the spirit rather joyfully on a regular basis.After the conflict, the government merged the local distilleries into one state-owned company, Kweichow Moutai. This move consolidated the status of this drink as the country\u2019s boozy darling. Fast forward to the present time, and C+ Caf\u00e9 & Bar is using the 53 percent ABV variant for their drink. Nobody\u2019s playing games here!Indeed, this is not a cheap cup of coffee. However, I will say that C+ Caf\u00e9 & Bar gets an A+ for their service and attention to detail. My Moutai Latte was served in a neat hexagonal tray containing a series of items \u2014 a small descriptive card, a beautifully cut shot glass with a frothy white potion, the latte itself and even the bottle of Moutai. The kind waitress dutifully explained the whole tasting experience to me, and here is how it goes.The shot glass is a mix of Moutai and milk, meant to serve as a primer for your taste buds. The latte, a trinity of coffee, milk and of course the liquor, is to be enjoyed in two stages. Sample it hot and the flavour of the coffee beans shall prevail. Wait for the latte to cool and the Moutai will ring in beautifully.I\u2019m sure it will come as no revelation that liquor fiends will be the true fans of this Moutai Latte. Honestly, I am not that big into spirits. The intense flavour of a full cup plus shot glass of this drink repeated on me a bit too much. That being said, I don\u2019t regret taking a risk with my order. You\u2019re going to find the whole concept pretty delectable if you drool with its western cousins \u2014think an Irish Coffee or, for my fellow Spaniards, the old school carajillo.I paired my Moutai Latte with some simple pleasures: a stroll down the guts of the industrial estate-cum-commercial area where C+ Caf\u00e9 & Bar is located, a wonderful podcast (seriously, go listen to Poetry Off the Shelf) and my current read (if you must know, it\u2019s Nazifa Islam\u2019s Forlorn Light). I\u2019d already told you before, hadn\u2019t I? This was never just about the coffee.C+ Caf\u00e9 & Bar (C+ \u5496\u5561)Cheng Xindong Intl.

            "description": "NewsBy Louis ThomasJames May is following up the success of his James Gin: Asian Parsnip with a limited UK release of 1,420 bottles of Asian Parsnip: Navy Strength.View this post on Instagram A post shared by James May (@jamesmaybloke)May\u2019s foray into gin making has been chronicled on his FoodTube YouTube channel, which has more than 380k subscribers. In the buildup to the original release of Asian Parsnip, May starred in a series of videos recording how he made each decision in the distillation and branding process, including choosing parsnip as the primary flavour of the spirit. The first batch sold so well that a second was promptly produced and sold overseas.The release of a \u201cNavy Strength\u201d gin came about when a fan from the US emailed inquiring about it. In the announcement video for the new gin, James is joined by Hugh Anderson, of Downton Distillery in Wiltshire, where Asian Parsnip was produced. Anderson explains that the term \u201cNavy Strength\u201d derives from the use of 100 proof gin onboard naval vessels so that if it were to contaminate the gunpowder, the powder would still ignite.Whereas a bottle of second batch Asian Parsnip costs \u00a339, a Navy Strength bottle costs \u00a355, due to the 57% ABV incurring higher duties. Whereas the Asian Parsnip bottles were hand-signed by May, he declared that he couldn\u2019t \u201creally be arsed\u201d this time. Instead, a QR code linking to a video of May will be on the back label of each Navy Strength bottle.This first run is limited to the UK, leaving the American fan who suggested the idea waiting. But, it can be anticipated that if it sells well domestically, there will be a second run for international gin lovers and Grand Tour fans.In recent years, May has reinvented himself as a Keith Floyd-esque gastronomic authority. In addition to the gin, he co-owns a pub in Wiltshire and presented a cookery show for Amazon Prime. And he is not the only member of the formerly-Top Gear trio to turn their hand to drinks. Jeremy Clarkson released Hawkstone Lager, brewed by The Cotswold Brewing Company using barley from Clarkson\u2019s own Diddly Squat Farm. Both May and Clarkson have used social media heavily to promote their products, though, predictably, Clarkson favours controversy in his approach to marketing.",

            "description": "NewsBy Douglas BlydeThe head sommelier of Restaurant Andrew Fairlie talks to Douglas Blyde about the best producers in the Netherlands, what to match with boudin blanc, and the possibility of Glendevon appellation contr\u00f4l\u00e9e\u2026What is your vintage?I was born in Rotterdam in 1991, a year from which I drank the stunning Moulin Touchais Coteaux du Layon on my birthday last September. Vintage Ports, too, are great from \u201891 though hard to come by.Who, for you, are the best Dutch winemakers?In the Netherlands, I\u2019ve always enjoyed the wines from De Apostelhoeve who produce some very good sparkling wines and still Rieslings, while Wijnhoeve de Kleine Schorre is receiving a lot of attention these days. And outside the Netherlands, I\u2019ve always been a great fan of the wines of Carel Voorhuis, made at Domaine d\u2019Ardhuy, Burgundy. We list his stunning 2005 Clos de Vougeot in the restaurant.Where did you work before Restaurant Andrew Fairlie?I\u2019ve worked in hospitality since I was 14, initially cleaning toilets in a hotel, later bartending at an Irish pub, then becoming sommelier alongside my studies at Restaurant Prei, Amsterdam. I moved to Scotland as part of an internship, working at The Strathearn before applying to Restaurant Andrew Fairlie in 2016. In less than a year I worked my way up from commis sommelier to assistant restaurant manager with a strong link to wine service and in May 2021 took on the role of head sommelier.How does the setting of the restaurant, including abstract art, enhance the enjoyment of wine?The beautiful art and slightly darker colour scheme brings mystique to the intimate atmosphere of the dining room which is tucked away in the Gleneagles Hotel. I think it stimulates the senses, greatly enhancing the joy of wine, food and good company.Almost all our artwork is created by Archie Forrest, a dear friend of Chef Andrew. Some of the art has a food theme, such as the charcoals of kitchen utensils, but most important to us are the portraits of Andrew which keeps him very much with us. Rachel Dein, meanwhile, created a bespoke piece featuring vegetables, herbs and fruit from our secret garden cast into an artwork.Describe your list?Fairly classic, reaching 350 listings. There\u2019s no need for us to have 1,000 bins: many guests here would either get lost or just give up because they are ready to start dinner and drink wine. We aim to list exceptional examples of appellations, producers and grape varieties to make it understandable. It is very important for me that what we list is in the right drinking window and doesn\u2019t need hours to breathe before finally living up to its potential. We are an ambassade for Krug, which has a very special place in our hearts. We also have an extensive selection from Jacques Selosse, Quintarelli, and have Barbaresco from the 1970s and Bordeaux from the 1980s and 1990s.Why don\u2019t you stock English wines?While there are some good wines made in England, I cannot always justify the price on them once compared to other wines on our list.What has been a sublime wine match with head chef, Stephen McLaughlin\u2019s chicken and truffle boudin blanc with watercress, and truffle sauce?The soft, but rich texture of Vi\u00f1a Tondonia Reserva Bianco 2009 from Lopez de Heredia follows the texture of the boudin blanc beautifully, while its savoury, subtle oxidative and ripe character really lifts the truffle, meatiness of the chicken and the Madeira in the sauce. Perfect harmony and interaction.How much of the current menu pays homage to the late, great Andrew Fairlie?The whole menu is strongly inspired by his vision and style. Simple food, brilliantly done, with a focus on local produce and classic French technique. Stevie worked with Andrew for 25 years and you can very clearly see his inspiration. Our home smoked Scottish lobster is the big classic, but there is no dish that he wouldn\u2019t have cooked.What did Andrew enjoy drinking?Deep, rich reds and mature Champagnes. In particular, Rioja, Bordeaux and vintage Krug. He also loved whisky. Ardbeg and Glenrothes were amongst his favourites.What grape or style of wine could you happily do without?I have never fully understood the big \u201cNatural Wine\u201d movement \u2013 people who are looking for \u201cfunky\u201d, which in my experience denotes often poorly made or even faulty wine. I embrace the idea of orange wine, different techniques and low intervention, but when a wine smells like something decomposing, please don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s good!What music do you play in the dining room?Jazz and soul selected by Theo Forrest. It breaks the stigma of being a posh, stiff two-star and gets people in the right mood for a great night.Tell us something surprising about yourself?I avoid book studies because I can\u2019t sit still for longer than five minutes! Instead, I learn by listening to people including winemakers, sommeliers and other industry professionals, dedicating my travels to wine producing areas, and of course by non-stop tasting.What is the most interesting book you\u2019ve read?\u201cStalin\u2019s Wine Cellar\u201d which a guest brought me.Do you ever get starstruck by your guests?We\u2019ve looked after some of the rich and famous and although it can be quite fun sometimes, the professional responsibility and relationship with diners always takes the upper hand.What spirit are you particularly excited by?Well-sherried, heavily peated whisky. We had a nice collection of whisky in the house I grew up in and I loved single malts from a young age. Moving to Scotland and tasting a dram at the very source was like a dream come true.What is the most beautiful vineyard you have been to?Drinking the wines from Klein Constantia in their vineyards up on the mountain, with a panoramic view over Cape Town and their vineyards. Truly breathtaking.Where would your fantasy vineyard be?Here in Scotland of course! Glendevon appellation contr\u00f4l\u00e9e.Who should prospective sommeliers contact if they want to join your team?Contact me on frenk@andrewfairlie.co.uk or via Instagram (@frenktrouw) for an informal chat. The consistent quality that runs through every member of our team is a strong and respectful work ethic.Restaurant Andrew Fairlie \u2013 The Gleneagles Hotel, Auchterarder PH3 1NF; 01764 694267; andrewfairlie.co.uk; reservations@andrewfairlie.co.uk",

Here's where your favourite tipple actually comes from...1 Russian vodka Smirnoff is made in the UK Credit: AlamyWhere is Smirnoff vodka made?When thinking of vodka, Russia often springs to mind.And it's true, Smirnoff was originally produced by Pyotr Arsenievich Smirnov at a distillery in the Russian capital Moscow back in 1864.But Smirnoff vodka is now owned by British drinks company Diageo, and is now made in distilleries both in Britain and all over the world.The best-selling vodka in the world in 2014, Smirnoff is now distributed to around 130 countries, including United States, India, Brazil, Italy and the PhilippinesAnd Smirnoff is not the only seemingly Russian vodka produced elsewhere.Another popular brand, Stolichnaya vodka is produced in Latvia by SPI group which is run by Russian-born Yuri Shefler who now lives in the UK.Similarly, popular luxury vodka brand Belvedere is made in Zyrardow, Poland.Who makes Smirnoff vodka?Diageo is one of the biggest beverage production companies in the world.It was the biggest distiller in the world up until 2017 when it was overtaken by Chinese brand Kweichow Moutai.The British beverage company is based in London and operates in more than 180 countries across Europe, North America, the Caribbean, Africa, Latin America and Asia.Diageo brands include Smirnoff vodka, Guinness stout, Johnnie Walker and Bell's whiskey, Captain Morgan's rum, Baileys Irish cream, and Gordon's gin.During the coronavirus pandemic Diageo pledged to donate enough alcohol to make eight million bottles of hand sanitiserIs Smirnoff Russian?Smirnoff vodka was originally produced in Russia but is now owned by British beverage company Diageo.It is no longer made in Russia.A descendent of original Smirnoff distiller Pyotr Smirnov started producing Smirnov vodka in Russia during the 1990s, using the original recipe.He claimed to be producing vodka more true to the Smirnov brand, but after a protracted legal battle, Smirnoff reclaimed its vodka trademark from Smirnov.Diageo went on to strike a deal with Smirnov in 2006.Diageo paid $50million for a 75% share of the Smirnov brand and business.",

            "description": "Taste of Guizhou (pronounced \u201cgwai-jo\u201d), Boston\u2019s only restaurant specializing in China\u2019s Guizhou (or Qian) cuisine, opened in Allston\u2019s Packard\u2019s Corner in mid-November 2021 at 1153 Commonwealth Avenue. A few months in, it\u2019s still flying under the radar, even though it\u2019s a significant addition to Boston\u2019s ever-expanding universe of regional Chinese cuisines. Qian cuisine isn\u2019t entirely new to the area \u2014 diners can find a few Qian soups on the menu at Newton restaurant IQ Kitchen \u2014 but Taste of Guizhou is the only Boston-area restaurant dedicated to the region.The restaurant has little online presence, even on Chinese social media apps WeChat and Red, and the exterior, still displaying the Wing It awning of its predecessor, leaves little clue that a new restaurant has established itself on the premises.\u201cI [wanted] to open a restaurant to see if people like Guizhou food,\u201d says co-owner George Pan, who manages the restaurant alongside his parents, Xianfeng Pan and Dianjun Pan, who prepare the food with help from one other cook. Pan, who graduated from Boston Conservatory at Berklee with a degree in contemporary dance performance a few years ago, was raised in Guiyang, Guizhou\u2019s capital city of 5 million inhabitants. \u201cGuizhou is deep in China, so not too many people know that area, but the food is very delicious,\u201d says Pan. \u201cI hope more people will know that area.\u201dThe lush, subtropical landlocked province is located in southwestern China, with waterfalls, ancient villages, and terraced rice paddies etched into mountains. It is also home to Kweichow (Guizhou) Moutai, the world\u2019s largest beverage company and producer of Maotai, a baiju spirit sometimes sold for over $20,000 per bottle. The region is also known for the ubiquitous Lao Gan Ma (\u201cOld Godmother\u201d) chile crisp sauce and also produces other traditional chile condiments that are less known globally, such as ciba lajiao, zao lajiao, zhanshui, and huajiao. Guizhou cuisine is every bit as fiery as Sichuan, but with added sour and sometimes sweet flavors complementing the spice.Taste of Guizhou emphasizes Qian cuisine\u2019s distinct spicy-and-sour style, which overlaps ingredients with neighboring Yunnan, Sichuan, and Hunan cuisines \u2014 styles that tend to be more familiar to Bostonians. Pan is proud to introduce Guizhou food to Boston and strongly feels it is one of the dark-horse contenders to be one of the great cuisines of China. He might be onto something. While the cultural diversity between the east coast of China and the southwest may be akin to the relationship between that of New Englanders and Southerners in the United States, everyone wants to eat each other\u2019s food.The current headliner at Taste of Guizhou is the Huaxi beef noodles (\u82b1\u6eaa\u725b\u8089\u7c89), named for a suburb of Guiyang. The rice noodles are similar to those in Yunnan cuisine, which Bostonians can find at a small number of local restaurants \u2014 Wen\u2019s Yunnan Noodle & Ramen in Back Bay and downtown Boston, Ten Second Yunnan Rice Noodles in Allston and Chinatown, and South of the Clouds in Brighton. Taste of Guizhou\u2019s noodles have a great bite and bounce, and they stay firm throughout the meal. Customers should savor the herbaceous, subtly complex broth a bit before disturbing the other side of the bowl, where the preserved cabbage awaits. Beef slices, lean and toothsome, are topped off with very fragrant white pepper and prickly ash, better known as Sichuan peppercorn.Taste of Guizhou has several other mifen (rice) noodle soups available, featuring chicken, seafood, or small, tender cubes of spicy braised beef. Pan designed the offerings to be flexible, so customers can have steamed rice or fresh wheat noodles instead of the rice noodles \u2014 a nontraditional option. \u201cWe had the machine, so we said, \u2018Why not?\u2019\u201dPan\u2019s favorite dish is only visible on the Chowbus delivery app (but diners can order it off-menu in person); look for fish in hot-and-sour soup for three (\u9178\u6c64\u9c7c\u706b\u9505\u5957\u9910 [2-3\u4eba\u4efd]). It is Taste of Guizhou\u2019s rendition of Kaili sour fish soup, which has two red and white substyles generically called suantangyu. The soup is the pride of the ethnic minority Miao or Hmong people in Guizhou. It\u2019s seen outside of Kaili, an area in Qiandongnan, the Miao and Dong people\u2019s autonomous prefecture, but it\u2019s something of a guarded recipe. Traditionally, it\u2019s made with carp, which is readily available in Boston fish markets. The key to the dish is a fermented sauce made of rice wine, tomatoes, salt, and chile pepper. The restaurant makes it in-house, over a four- or five-day process.Taste of Guizhou also serves a small but growing selection of side dishes, good for sharing or solo dining, including fried tofu balls; sticky rice rolled with sweet sausage and spicy sauce; fried sweet dumplings with pickled cabbage; stir-fried snails; fried potato balls; cruller wrapped in tortilla and spicy sweet sauce; and the extremely spicy \u201cdevil\u2019s fried rice,\u201d another dish from Guiyang, which contains sweet sausage, hot chile sauce, and cabbage. Each is under $20, and all will get diners into the rhythm of Guizhou\u2019s spicy and sour cuisine.The restaurant\u2019s Guizhou offerings are complemented by a ready-to-rock big plate chicken from Xinjiang in northwest China, simply labeled \u201chot chicken stew\u201d on the menu, featuring creamy potatoes, bell pepper, and chopped bone-in chicken. \u201cIt\u2019s a dish that is popular all over China,\u201d says Pan, \u201cand one of our chefs happens to make an excellent version of it.\u201d Pan and his family aim to please by making customization available here too: It may be \u201cbig\u201d plate chicken, but one can order it in small, medium, or large, and there\u2019s also the option to get it on rice in place of the customary wide belt noodles.Taste of Guizhou is currently open for lunch and dinner Tuesday through Sunday, offering 16 indoor seats, takeout, and delivery. Note that while the restaurant\u2019s printed menu seems to offer a very abbreviated taste of Guizhou, customers can find a more expansive selection on delivery platforms such as Chowbus, or by inquiring by phone or in person.",

            "description": "Thank you for supporting our journalism. This article is available exclusively for our subscribers, who help fund our work at the Chicago Tribune.The concept of having \u201ceverything\u201d goes beyond toppings at a highly anticipated new restaurant in Chicago.\u201cCon Todo is a Mexican restaurant focusing on Mexico City, but less about the food and more about the actual city,\u201d said Jonathan Zaragoza, chef and partner. \u201cMexico City is a melting pot. People forget there are a lot of different cultures that have been influencing the food in that city for so long.\u201dAdvertisementChef Jonathan Zaragoza creates the pamburguesa at Con Todo Cantina y Cocina on Feb. 3, 2022, in the Logan Square neighborhood. The restaurant opened in January for pickup and delivery and plans to open the dining area in March. (Erin Hooley / Chicago Tribune)The confluence extends all the way to al pastor, first made by Lebanese immigrants in Mexico.\u201cPeople think of it as Mexican. And it is. It\u2019s inherently both,\u201d said the chef. The vertically roasted pork looks like a Chicago-style gyros meat cone. \u201cBut there are a lot of different cultural backgrounds and ethnicities that populate the city, because it is such a giant city.\u201dAdvertisementMany say the same of Chicago, where Zaragoza was born and raised in his family\u2019s critically acclaimed restaurant Birrieria Zaragoza, unrelated to his new venture.Managing partners and brothers JC and Edgar Casta\u00f1eda bought the building this spring, previously home to Yusho and Jam. The Casta\u00f1eda family owns Lalo\u2019s, a taqueria with locations in the city and suburbs.\u201cWe\u2019re not sticking to traditional stuff,\u201d Zaragoza said of Con Todo. \u201cWe\u2019re just expressing ourselves.\u201dOne expression that has emerged as an early fan favorite is his pamburguesa ($16), a convergence of a pambazo sandwich \u2014 dipped in red pepper sauce with all the voracity of a Chicago-style Italian beef \u2014 and a hamburguesa smashed cheeseburger, with spiced fries on the side.\u201cEveryone\u2019s going crazy about the burger,\u201d Zaragoza said. \u201cI think it\u2019s kind of funny, because it does taste like a pambazo.\u201dThe pamburguesa: Slagel farms smash burger, guajillo-stained telera bun, shaved white onion, queso Americano, salsa especial, pickles, served with chori-spiced papas fritas. (Erin Hooley / Chicago Tribune)He\u2019s focused on their first phase of opening with takeout and delivery only, highlighting his D.F. hot chicken torta ($15), a spicy fried breast loaded with griddled Chihuahua cheese and a side of seasoned wheat crisps \u2014 plus handmade corn tortillas.When pressed for his personal favorite item on the concise menu, he paused for just a moment.\u201cI love tacos so much,\u201d said the chef. \u201cIt has to be the al pastor.\u201dAdvertisementThey use pork shoulder and grill the pineapple too. After the meat is slathered with a rub made in-house, it\u2019s roasted on a coal-fired al pastor spit.\u201cWho doesn\u2019t love silky, crispy pork; a handmade tortilla that\u2019s dragged through a little bit of extra grease?\u201d he said.You can also order a Sinaloa Roadside chicken ($24), a grilled half-chicken platter with escabeche, salsa and tortillas.Cocktails to-go include a margarita and Paloma. A collaborative beer with Casa Humilde Cerveceria will be sold in cans; the horchata milk stout was made in partnership with the brewery\u2019s co-founding brothers, Javier and Jose Lopez.That could pair beautifully with the desserts.\u201cEveryone thinks of me like, \u2018Oh, the goat guy,\u2019 \u201d Zaragoza said, laughing. \u201cBut I love doing pastries. I think a good dessert can make or break a meal.\u201dAdvertisementPineapple upside-down cake made of piloncillo caramel cake, grilled pineapple and burnt cinnamon whipped cream is on the menu at Con Todo Cantina y Cocina. (Erin Hooley / Chicago Tribune)His grilled pineapple upside-down cake ($9) with burnt cinnamon whipped cream could make a meal.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of custardy almost, but really satisfying,\u201d said the chef. \u201cIt\u2019s acidic and creamy, but not too sweet.\u201dThe dessert goes far beyond the street food that inspired the name of the restaurant.\u201cIf you\u2019re on the streets of Mexico City and you go to a taco stand, 99.9% of the time the taquero, when they\u2019re about to complete your order, they\u2019ll ask, \u2018\u00bfLos quieres con todo?\u2019\u201cThat means, \u2018Do you want them with everything?\u2019 \u201d Zaragoza said. \u201cUsually that means cilantro, onion and lime.\u201dCustomers simply answer \u201ccon todo\u201d or \u201cwith everything.\u201dAdvertisement\u201cIt is an embodiment of our approach to hospitality,\u201d said the chef. \u201cI have Birrieria Zaragoza, and its service there is very warm and welcoming. We want to translate that into our ethos here at Con Todo.\u201cIt\u2019s so hard opening a business in general, and then opening a business in the middle of a pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure a million people have that same story. But we\u2019re so thankful just to be able to provide people with a little bit of light, hopefully, and levity in these weird times.\u201d2853 N.

            "description": "Last week, my colleague Sunniva Kolostyak asked if it was time to ditch booze stocks. The question comes as some took the \u2018Dry January\u2019 challenge \u2013 so why not take it to your portfolio?Alcohol is a \u2018Sin Stock\u2019, in the company of the other (supposedly) \u2018seedier\u2019 industries of gambling, tobacco, defence (gun manufacturers, for example), cannabis, and adult entertainment, among others. For various reasons \u2013 cultural, religious, personal convictions \u2013 some investors decide to avoid some or all of these industries and stocks altogether.From an environmental, social and governance (ESG) lens as well, these sin stocks have come under scrutiny. In a 2021 study on the ESG performance of sin stocks, researchers Gabriel Paradis and Eduardo Schiehll found that sin stocks have a lower overall ESG performance as well as for each of the three ESG pillars and that this difference is more significant concerning governance and some key social and environmental issues for which sin stocks could have compensated risk exposure with responsible management practices. Their results demonstrate that sin stocks are exposed to more severe ESG issues and consistently lack the necessary practices to mitigate these issues.Is Booze ESG-Friendly?Morningstar company Sustainalytics says alcoholic beverages are considered controversial because excessive drinking can lead to social problems like addiction and public health issues. Certain religions also outlaw intoxicants, making them unsuitable investments for people of faith. Plus, it uses a lot of water.\u201cAs Morningstar analyst Kate Matrosova recently discussed, there are no alternatives to freshwater, unlike fossil fuels; as a result, our reliance on water poses not only critical challenges to the health of ecosystems but also to the operations of businesses, communities, and society,\u201d Kolostyak says, pointing out that in 2011, the drinks giant Diageo (DGE) used on average 6.9 litres of water per litre of finished product.Still, Kolostyak acknowledges that alcohol remains the sin stock category people seem least worried about. A Robeco study of pension funds in the Nordics \u2014 the region that\u2019s arguably the toughest on imposing exclusions \u2014 found that only tobacco stocks are shunned on a large scale, while alcohol and gambling are not. This doesn\u2019t seem to make much sense.Why Alcohol is a Sin StockPut simply, alcohol kills. In Canada, StatCan found that in 2020, the number and rate of alcohol-induced deaths increased among those under the age of 65. Among those aged 0 to 44, the number of alcohol-induced deaths rose from 325 (1.6 deaths per 100,000 people) in 2019 to 480 (2.3 deaths per 100,000 people) in 2020. There was also an increase in the number of alcohol-induced deaths in those aged 45 to 64 in 2020 (1,790 or 17.7 deaths per 100,000 people) compared with 2019 (1,525 or 15.0 deaths per 100,000 people) (These numbers exclude accidental deaths, like drunk driving).Plus, there is evidence that alcohol causes cancer. In 2018, a Lancet report funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation stated bluntly, \u201cAlcohol use is a leading risk factor for global disease burden and causes substantial health loss. We found that the risk of all-cause mortality, and of cancers specifically, rises with increasing levels of consumption, and the level of consumption that minimizes health loss is zero.\u201c Essentially, the safest amount of alcohol to consume is none.This isn\u2019t news to Tim Stockwell at the Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, who points out that the World Health Organization (WHO) declared alcohol a Class 1 carcinogen 30 years ago. He was a part of a 2018 experiment in Yukon, that put cancer warning labels on alcohol, to examine changes in the intervention versus comparison site for three outcomes: unprompted and prompted recall of the cancer warning, and knowledge that alcohol can cause cancer. It found that in a real-world setting, cancer warning labels get noticed and increase knowledge that alcohol can cause cancer \u2013 however, four weeks after the experiment began, it was shut down by industry lobbyists.Some of the main industry arguments questioned the content and validity of the cancer label message itself, claiming the cancer warning was inaccurate, unproven, and based on false or unsound evidence. Arguments also frequently highlighted risk factors for cancer aside from alcohol, and that the link between alcohol and cancer is too complex for a single label. The industry also argued that there are also health benefits to alcohol. The industry also insisted that alcohol is not the same as tobacco \u2013 which makes sense because many of these tactics were used by the tobacco industry in the past.It's not all bad news though. Despite the pulling of cancer labels, some of the messaging about drinking seems to stick. All large alcohol companies proactively emphasize the importance of responsible drinking, and labels do exist to tell consumers to not drink to excess, and curb consumption when pregnant.But the Stocks Pay Dividends\u201cIt is widely accepted that it is excessive and irresponsible consumption of alcohol that is problematic, not consumption in moderation \u2014 and it is the latter practised by the overwhelming majority of drinkers worldwide,\" says Swetha Ramachandran, investment manager at GAM Investments. Speaking to Kolostyak, she added a blanket policy of no investment in alcohol companies can be a blunt instrument when it comes to achieving ESG objectives. she says.Also, don't forget the income. Diageo, for example, has increased its dividend every year for more than 20 years. \u201cDiageo is the best collection of alcoholic beverage brands in one company that exists anywhere in the world. We're lucky that it's a UK company,\u201d Nick Train, who holds Diageo in Silver-rated Finsbury Growth & Income Trust told Morningstar.co.uk in 2020.Kolostyak finds that among Morningstar\u2019s rated booze stocks, 10 even have a wide economic moat rating. Pernod Richard and Diageo are the companies with the lowest ESG risk rating. Chinese Kweichow Moutai (600519) has the highest ESG risk, and the second-best three-year annualized return of the stocks, with 42.57%, behind Wuliangye Yibin (000858), which has grown 60.60% year-on-year for three years.Funds Already FermentingDo you hold alcohol stocks in your funds? For Canadian investors, alcohol might be held in global equity, European equity, emerging market equity, or international equity funds. We pulled a list of open-ended mutual funds from Morningstar Direct, that had over 4.5% of their holdings in either wineries & distilleries, or breweries. Many of these funds earn a forward-looking Morningstar Quantitative Rating, or MQR. The scale for the Quantitative Rating is the same as for Analyst Ratings: Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral and Negative, which provide a forward-looking assessment of a fund's ability to outperform its peer group or a relevant benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis over a full market cycle.

Not me, that\u2019s for sure!Scott, Aimsir\u2019s wine list has been described by The Irish Examiner\u2019s Leslie Williams as being, \u201cby far the best selection of natural and biodynamic wine in Ireland.\u201d How and why have you achieved this?The success of the wine list is down to the amazing suppliers we have in Ireland. They source the wines and work hard to get allocations of the best producers in the world. Without them I would not have access to great wines to put on the list.Jordan, how many courses do you serve?We only offer one tasting menu which consists of 18 servings. Starting with snacks, then on to bread, a couple of smaller dishes, the main, cheese course, desserts, and then finishing off with a selection of sweet treats.Scott, who is your favourite producer on the list?At the moment definitely Burja, Zelen, Slovenia. It is such an interesting style and works so well with food.Jordan, what has been a standout pairing?For me it has to be the Killahora rare apple ice wine from Co. Cork paired with my cheese course of Young Buck raw milk blue cheese, blackened onion, fermented honey and toasted sunflower seeds. It\u2019s a pairing that has been on since day one of opening in some shape or form and it won\u2019t be going anywhere soon.Scott, what styles of wine might not work with Aimsir\u2019s cuisine?Young, big, heavy and tannic reds tend to not make it on pairing. I have some on the list as that can be the guests preference. But as a style they generally would overpower most dishes.Jordan, what drink do you crave after a long day?A big cold beer! We serve a selection of beers from Lock 13 at Kildare Brewing Company in the restaurant but I normally always go for a can of their Soldier Island IPA. So crisp and refreshing after a long days work.Scott, what was the first wine to move you?The wine that really caught my attention was Matthieu Barret, Cornas, Brise Cailloux 2006 from the northern Rh\u00f4ne. I did a masterclass in my second year in college. These were my very early days of learning about wine. It was special: it triggered my curiosity to pursue wine as a career.Jordan, what are the most exciting spirits you work with?I\u2019ve really started to get into whiskies over the past few years, so it has to be the great selection of Irish whiskeys we have on offer in our lounge. I drink mine mostly neat or with a beautifully large single cube of ice.Scott, what has been a thrilling vineyard visit?It would have to be visiting Bollinger. We saw the famous vineyard from which only exceptional vintages of Vieilles Vignes Francaises are made. It was incredibly small and unassuming for such a prestigious wine. The whole tour of the vineyards and the Champagne tunnels and old cellars was just remarkable.Jordan, how seriously do you take non-alcoholic drinks?As much thought goes into pairing our non-alcoholic offering as our wine pairing, if not even more. Majken works closely with me to develop them and because we make each one from scratch we can really manipulate the final outcome to perfectly match the food, even more so than the wine sometimes.Scott, what is your preferred digestif?An old fashioned.Jordan, tell us something surprising about yourself?I\u2019m seriously into all things cars, especially Formula 1. We are hopefully heading to a couple of races this year if all goes well.Scott, which wine writer do you most enjoy reading?Michael Broadbent MW. Although he did most of his writing several years ago, he is still someone I constantly find myself going back to. He has an incredible understanding of all aspects of wine, but his writing on wine tasting and wine and food pairing are phenomenal and has helped me to improve and understand food and wine to a better level.Jordan, who should prospective team members contact if they want to the team at Aimsir?The main thing we look for is someone who is highly motivated, passionate, positive and a good listener. Please e-mail bookings@aimsir.ie and then we can take it from there.Aimsir Restaurant \u2013 Cliff at Lyons, Lyons Road, Celbridge, Kildare, W23 HXH3, Ireland; +353 1 630 3500; info@aimsir.ie; aimsir.ie",

            "description": "\"Il vero volto del fumo \u00e8 la malattia, la morte e l'orrore. Non il glamour e la raffinatezza che gli spacciatori nell'industria del tabacco cercano di ritrarre\", ha detto una volta il musicista ed ex cantante dei Talking Heads, David Byrne.Se si concorda con lui e si \u00e8 un investitore, i numeri che seguono potrebbero non piacere. E, in occasione della Giornata Mondiale contro il cancro (4 febbraio), potrebbe essere utile controllare il proprio portafoglio.L'indice Morningstar Global Tobacco ha guadagnato l\u20198,9% dall'inizio dell'anno (in euro fino all\u20191 febbraio). Nello stesso periodo, il paniere dei mercati globali ha registrato -3,3%. Nel 2021 il primo benchmark ha segnato +20%. Un risultato non troppo lontano dal +26% registrato dall'indice Global Markets.Andamento indici Morningstar Global Tobacco e Global markets a confrontoFonte: Morningstar DirectRisultati che non sorprendono. Il tabacco, almeno dal punto di vista degli investimenti, \u00e8 una storia di crescita.Secondo la societ\u00e0 di analisi Research & Markets, il mercato globale del tabacco valeva 729,90 miliardi di dollari nel 2020 e si prevede che crescer\u00e0 a un tasso del 3,78% fino al 2026 per raggiungere 908,29 miliardi di dollari.Ma se parliamo di cancro, il tabacco \u00e8 qualcosa a cui dobbiamo fare attenzione. In questo senso pu\u00f2 essere utile guardare agli Stati Uniti. Secondo l'American Cancer Society:-Il cancro ai polmoni negli Usa provoca ancora pi\u00f9 di 350 decessi ogni giorno, che \u00e8 il numero pi\u00f9 alto di decessi fra tutti i tipi di cancro, maggiore dei tumori al seno, alla prostata e al pancreas messi insieme. Provoca 2,5 volte pi\u00f9 decessi rispetto al cancro del colon-retto, la seconda causa di morte per cancro negli Stati Uniti.-Si prevede che circa 8 decessi su 10 (l\u201981%) per cancro ai polmoni nel 2022 saranno causati dal fumo di sigarette. Le persone che fumano hanno circa 25 volte pi\u00f9 probabilit\u00e0 di sviluppare il cancro ai polmoni rispetto a quelle che non hanno mai fumato.-Il fumo passivo causa quasi il 3% delle nuove diagnosi di cancro ai polmoni e si prevede che nel 2022 provocher\u00e0 circa il 3% dei decessi.In Europa,secondo una ricerca coordinata dall'Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano assieme all'Universit\u00e0 di Bologna e sostenuta dalla Fondazione Airc per la Ricerca sul Cancro nel 2022 aumenteranno i decessi per cancro al polmone (+ 2% nell'Ue e +5% nelle donne nel Regno Unito). Il tutto in una situazione di riduzione del tasso di mortalit\u00e0 di alcune delle forme di tumore pi\u00f9 diffuse.Stringendo l\u2019osservazione alla Penisola, secondo l\u2019ultimo rapporto \"I numeri del cancro in Italia (2021)\", nel nostro paese i tassi di mortalit\u00e0 per tutti i tumori sono diminuiti all\u2019incirca del 10% negli uomini e dell\u20198% nelle donne tra il 2015 e il 2021. Nelle donne, tuttavia, i tassi di mortalit\u00e0 sono in aumento per il tumore del polmone (+ 5%) e per il tumore del pancreas (+ 3.9%). In Italia, il tumore al polmone \u00e8 la terza neoplasia pi\u00f9 frequente negli uomini e la seconda nelle donne, e causa un numero di decessi superiore a quello di qualunque altra forma di cancro.Tabacco e investimentiApparentemente, il tabacco non \u00e8 molto presente nei fondi di investimento. Secondo i dati Morningstar, le tre categorie azionarie in cui pesa di pi\u00f9 sono: UK Equity Income, seguita dalla UK Large-Cap Equity e dalla Global Equity Income.Le categorie dove \u00e8 pi\u00f9 presente il tabaccoFonte: Morningstar DirectL'immagine cambia un po' se si guardano i dettagli delle singole categorie.Per semplicit\u00e0 di esempio possiamo controllare la categoria Morningstar Global Equity Income (il pi\u00f9 popolato fra i tre segmenti). Alcuni fondi hanno una parte del loro portafoglio investita nel tabacco.Nell tabella in basso sono elencati i sei fondi che hanno la percentuale maggiore di product involvement nel tabacco.Fonte: Morningstar DirectNaturalmente, ci sono altre strategie che non hanno affatto tabacco e che lo escludono dal loro universo di investimento (vedi la tabella sotto).Fonte: Morningstar DirectAttenzione all\u2019alcolAl tabacco come investimento, secondo l\u2019editorial manager di Morningstar in Canada, Ruth Saldana, pu\u00f2 essere associato l\u2019alcol (clicca qui per leggere l'articolo in versione originale). E per diversi motivi. I titoli di entrambi i settori rientrano nel gruppo delle cosiddette sin stock, un universo che comprende anche le azioni del gioco d'azzardo, della difesa (produttori di armi, ad esempio), della cannabis e dell'intrattenimento per adulti, tra gli altri. Per vari motivi - convinzioni culturali, religiose, personali - alcuni investitori decidono di evitare del tutto alcuni o tutti questi settori e i loro titoli.Ma ci sono altri elementi che accomunano alcol e tabacco. Il primo, come il secondo, uccide. Anche per cancro. Nel 2018, un rapporto della rivista Lancet finanziato dalla Fondazione Bill e Melinda Gates spiegava senza mezzi termini che \"l'uso di alcol \u00e8 un fattore di rischio principale quando si parla di malattie globali e provoca una notevole perdita di salute. Abbiamo scoperto che il rischio di mortalit\u00e0 per tutte le cause, e di cancro in particolare, aumenta con l'aumento dei livelli di consumo. Il livello di consumo che riduce al minimo la perdita di salute \u00e8 zero\u201d.Nel caso dell\u2019alcol non va dimenticata la questione ambientale. Le industrie di questo settore, ad esempio, utilizzano grandi quantit\u00e0 di acqua. Secondo, Kate Matrosova, analista di Morningstar, non ci sono alternative all'acqua dolce, a differenza dei combustibili fossili. Di conseguenza, la nostra dipendenza dall'acqua pone non solo sfide critiche per la salute degli ecosistemi, ma anche per le attivit\u00e0 di imprese, comunit\u00e0 e societ\u00e0.Dal punto di vista culturale, l'alcol rimane la categoria di sin stock di cui le persone sembrano meno preoccupate. Uno studio Robeco sui fondi pensione nei paesi nordici - la regione che \u00e8 probabilmente la pi\u00f9 severa nell'imporre esclusioni - ha rilevato che solo le azioni del tabacco vengono evitate, mentre l'alcol e il gioco d'azzardo no.Sul fronte operativo, tuttavia, ci sono questioni che non possono essere evitate. Ad esempio i dividendi. Secondo un\u2019analisi della data journalist di Morningstar UK, Sunniva Kolostyak, Diageo, ad esempio, aumenta la sua cedola ogni anno da oltre 20 anni. Tra tutti i titoli del settore alcol coperti dalla ricerca Morningstar, inoltre, 10 hanno un Economic moat considerato Ampio. Pernod Richard e Diageo sono le societ\u00e0 con il rating di rischio ESG pi\u00f9 basso. La cinese Kweichow Moutai ha il rischio ESG pi\u00f9 elevato insieme a Wuliangye Yibin."

            "description": "NewsBy Ron EmlerThe Chinese New Year period is key for drinks sales in the Far East, with the pre-festival sell-in period skewing quarterly sales and profit figures for spirits giants like Diageo, Pernod Ricard and R\u00e9my Cointreau.Starting this year on February 1 and heralding the Year of the Tiger, the two-week Chinese New Year (Spring Festival) holiday period is the prime time for feasting and gifting, with spirits especially heading up purchasing lists.Alibaba (China\u2019s equivalent of Amazon) reckons that 30% of its alcohol sales bought as gifts are associated with the festival. Almost exclusively they are in the premium price brackets.Yet while the global players are all making big efforts to grab growing shares of the market in China (which is Pernod Ricard\u2019s second largest and is also critical to the fortunes of R\u00e9my Cointreau), it remains dominated by baijiu, which accounts for 96% of alcohol consumption in the People\u2019s Republic.Latest figures show that by contrast Cognac holds a 3% market share and scotch whisky just 1%. Other spirits such as gin, Tequila or vodka hardly register in the statistics.Baijiu is considered the national spirit in China, made by fermenting sorghum or rice. It has been part of the cultural repertoire since the Ming Dynasty which began in the mid 14th century.Statista estimates the sales of baijiu in 2020 approached $92 billion but were held back by the coronavirus pandemic, which impacted uptake during the Chinese New Year celebrations. It is probable that today baijiu is a $100bn market.By comparison, last year the global market for all whiskies was around $80bn while that for Scotch whisky is put at about \u00a35.5bn ($7.5bn).But baijiu is an all-encompassing category for locally produced alcohol which can cost just a few pence for a weak, beer-like beverage while a bottle of the highest grade of prestigious Wuliangve retails for $3,375.A 1935 vintage bottle of Moutai sold for \u00a31.2 million at auction, according to BaijiuBlog.com.Yet while demand has soared over the past few years, output shrank from 13 billion litres in 2016 to 7.6 billion in 2019 according to Satatista. Despite lockdown restrictions in 2020, revenue from the local market still increased by $3.5 billion in the year compared to 2019 as producers raised their prices and margins.In response, the share prices of the main players have shot up. In autumn 2018, Kweichow Moutai, the largest, was valued at just more than $100 billion; at the start of this year it was priced at a little over $400 billion. By comparison Diageo is capitalised at $145 billion.Even allowing for share price slippage since then due to fears of a reappearance of coronavirus in China, Moutai remains the world\u2019s 23rd most valuable company and the third most valuable in Asia.Steffi No\u00ebla of Daxue Consulting in Shanghai recently said in an interview, \u201cAt least seven to eight companies in the baijiu industry have great financial conditions. Return on equity for Moutai and Wuliangye can reach as high as 35.6% and 22.9% respectively. The industry also has an easy business model with a 90% profit margin.\u201dBy 2029, China\u2019s high-end liquor industry is expected to be a $25 billion market, most of that from baijiu sales but increasingly at the higher end of the price spectrum as China\u2019s middle class and its disposable wealth expands rapidly.So it is little wonder that big players are keen to grab some of the action alongside developing their whiskey markets in China \u2013 for instance, Pernod Ricard has opened its own distillery and Diageo has started to build one.First into Baijiu was Diageo in 2013 when it bought a 40% stake in the parent company of high-end producer Shui Jing Fang, which it has since increased to 60%. In 2019 Pernod Ricard signed a distribution collaboration pact with Wuliangve to cover their joint interests in Asian markets.Yet, while baijiu is the world\u2019s most frequently consumed liquor, thanks largely to China\u2019s 1.3 billion population, it is virtually unknown beyond its borders other than in travel retail outlets where purchases as gifts for the Chinese diasporas are the driving force.But all that is changing. Baijiu has a small specialist demand in ex-pat Chinese communities but now it is being targeted at a wider consumer base, notably in the US where it is being promoted as a cocktail ingredient rather than as the traditional \u201cdown-in-one\u201d shot.Luzhou Laojiao, the oldest continually operating distillery in China, and among the top four most valuable spirits worldwide, is expanding with its Ming River variant, exclusively targeting consumers outside mainland China.Derek Sandhaus, co-founder of Ming River, said recently: \u201cWe have created a name and packaging that is more accessible for the international market, but respects the product\u2019s heritage. Our sales numbers confirm that many more people are drinking baijiu in the US in the past couple of years.\u201dSome small brands are repackaging themselves to appeal to a younger market. In 2018, people in the 25 to 34 years old age bracket accounted for the highest consumption of baijiu, according to Global Data.There are at least six brands in the fledgling European market.Meanwhile, Kentucky\u2019s Buffalo Trace Distillery, owned by Sazerac, has launched a baijiu-style spirit aged in just three new American oak casks as part of its Experimental Collection of spirits.Jim Boyce, founder of World Baijiu Day (9 August) says there is a growing shift for brands to target the young.Interestingly, Ming River\u2019s Sandhaus says that the category is better received by those who have never tried baijiu and know little about it. \u201cThey don\u2019t bring with them any misconceptions about what baijiu is and should be,\u201d he says.\u65b0\u5e74\u5feb\u4e50",

O l\u00edquido nada mais \u00e9 do que um licor incolor com teor alco\u00f3lico entre 35% e 60% por volume. Esta bebida espirituosa de alta qualidade \u00e9 destilada de gr\u00e3os como arroz, pain\u00e7o e sorgo. Seu sabor \u00e9 considerado ex\u00f3tico para os paladares ocidentais. Acredita-se que surgiu mais ou menos na mesma \u00e9poca que outros destilados na Europa (brandy, s\u00e9culo 14, ou vodca, no 15) e na Am\u00e9rica (cacha\u00e7a, s\u00e9culo 16).Nos \u00faltimos anos, o baijiu come\u00e7ou a chamar aten\u00e7\u00e3o fora dos limites da China. Impulsionando essa tend\u00eancia est\u00e3o influenciadores de heran\u00e7a chinesa animados para elevar a bebida ao mesmo status internacional de outros destilados regionais, como a tequila no M\u00e9xico, a cacha\u00e7a no Brasil e a vodca na R\u00fassia.Hist\u00f3rico poderosoZhou Enlai, o primeiro-ministro chin\u00eas, e Richard Nixon, presidente dos Estados Unidos entre 1969 e 1974, brindaram com baijiu quando os pa\u00edses restabeleceram as rela\u00e7\u00f5es internacionais. Al\u00e9m disso, dizem que pol\u00edticos e empres\u00e1rios usaram, por muito tempo, a bebida como uma efetiva forma de propina.Para as novas gera\u00e7\u00f5esDe olho nos mais jovens, a marca Jiangxiaobai investe em r\u00f3tulos coloridos e com frases de efeito. A marca, fundada em 2012, j\u00e1 patrocinou festivais de m\u00fasica, s\u00e9ries e at\u00e9 um anime, no qual a protagonista leva seu nome. A bebida vem em vers\u00f5es saborizadas, com menor gradua\u00e7\u00e3o alco\u00f3lica. Dessa forma, as novas gera\u00e7\u00f5es est\u00e3o descobrindo coquet\u00e9is \u00e0 base de baijiu em locais como Pequim, Xangai, Hong Kong e Shenzhen.Artigo de luxoOutra mudan\u00e7a recente \u00e9 uma certa gourmetiza\u00e7\u00e3o do baijiu. A gigante chinesa de bebidas Kweichow Moutai, fabricante da bebida, viu suas a\u00e7\u00f5es explodirem e tornou-se o investimento mais valioso do continente, fazendo a empresa ultrapassar em valor de mercado o Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., o maior banco da China. A fabricante do baijiu agora vale 1,81 trilh\u00e3o de yuans (US$ 256 bilh\u00f5es).Segundo a firma de an\u00e1lises de mercado Euromonitor International, o consumo da bebida caiu 21% nos \u00faltimos cinco anos, mas o faturamento cresceu 39%. Nos \u00faltimos anos, tem sido dif\u00edcil encontr\u00e1-las nas prateleiras, ent\u00e3o os mais afoitos desembolsam at\u00e9 R$ 2.300 por uma garrafa de meio litro em mercados paralelos.Onde beber?A bebida \u00e9 dif\u00edcil de ser encontrada fora das fronteiras chinesas. Procure por bares especializados emergentes, como o Boston Baijiu Bar; coquet\u00e9is de baijiu como o White Rabbit no Viridian, em Oakland, na Calif\u00f3rnia.

            "description": "(BFM Bourse) - R\u00e9alis\u00e9 au 30 d\u00e9cembre, ce classement des groupes cot\u00e9s les mieux valoris\u00e9s de la plan\u00e8te met en \u00e9vidence une acc\u00e9l\u00e9ration de la tendance observ\u00e9e ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es. Alors que Wall Street p\u00e8se d\u00e9sormais pr\u00e8s de 50.000 milliards de dollars, les g\u00e9ants technologiques ont fait main basse sur le palmar\u00e8s.Plus que jamais domin\u00e9 par les GAFAM, le top 100 des plus grandes capitalisations mondiales \u00e9tabli \u00e0 la cl\u00f4ture du 30 d\u00e9cembre illustre plus largement la supr\u00e9matie de Wall Street sur les autres Bourses mondiales. Au-del\u00e0 de ce constat, ce palmar\u00e8s invite \u00e0 tirer plusieurs enseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires, du poids pris par le secteur technologique \u00e0 travers le monde au vif recul des valeurs chinoises apr\u00e8s de multiples tour de vis de P\u00e9kin.100 entreprises p\u00e8sent collectivement 36.800 milliards de dollars\u00c0 lire aussi Le top 100 des plus grosses capitalisations boursi\u00e8res mondiales en 2020Le premier constat qui saute aux yeux lorsque l'on compare ce palmar\u00e8s avec celui \u00e9tabli un an auparavant, c'est que les grands groupes ont continu\u00e9 de grossir en 2021. Alors que le seuil pour int\u00e9grer ce classement au 25 d\u00e9cembre 2020 \u00e9tait fix\u00e9 \u00e0 117 milliards de dollars (Total \u00e9tait alors en 100e position), celui-ci a grimp\u00e9 \u00e0 137,5 milliards de dollars (Unilever) au 30 d\u00e9cembre 2021.Si les principaux indices mondiaux ont enregistr\u00e9 de robustes hausses annuelles \u00e0 deux chiffres sur les 12 dernier mois, ces performances ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9s par les poids lourds de la cote. Et alors que la capitalisation totale des Bourses mondiales a franchi les 120.000 milliards de dollars pour la premi\u00e8re fois en novembre dernier, les 100 groupes les mieux valoris\u00e9s au monde p\u00e8sent d\u00e9sormais collectivement 36.800 milliards, contre 30.400 milliards un an plus t\u00f4t. Autrement dit, si les march\u00e9s mondiaux accueillent plus de 40.000 soci\u00e9t\u00e9s cot\u00e9es \u00e0 travers le monde, les 100 plus grosses d'entre elles repr\u00e9sentent donc plus de 30% de la valorisation totale.Wall Street d\u00e9vore les autres places boursi\u00e8resD\u00e9j\u00e0 mise en exergue dans le palmar\u00e8s 2020, l'ultra-domination des groupes \u00e9tats-uniens sur la plan\u00e8te finance s'est encore exacerb\u00e9e en 2021. Le pays de l'oncle Sam place en effet 64 entreprises dans ce classement, contre 58 l'an dernier. Parmi celles-ci, 8 figurent dans le top 10 et 14 dans le top 20, au sein duquel parviennent seulement \u00e0 s'immiscer deux groupes chinois (Tencent au 11e rang et Kweichow Moutai au 19e), un saoudien (Saudi Aramco, 4e), un ta\u00efwanais (TSMC, 10e), un sud-cor\u00e9en (Samsung, 16e) et un fran\u00e7ais (LVMH, 18e).Le podium des plus grandes capitalisations mondiales est en outre exclusivement compos\u00e9 de g\u00e9ants technologiques californiens. De nouveau sur le tr\u00f4ne, Apple a r\u00e9cemment d\u00e9pass\u00e9 la barre des 3.000 milliards de dollars, soit davantage que la valorisation combin\u00e9e des 40 entreprises du CAC (le groupe pesait 2.923 milliards de dollars fin d\u00e9cembre). Microsoft \u00e9marge pour sa part \u00e0 pr\u00e8s de 2.500 milliards, alors qu'Alphabet (Google) se rapproche des 2.000 milliards. Deuxi\u00e8me \u00e0 fin d\u00e9cembre 2020, le g\u00e9ant p\u00e9trolier Saudi Aramco r\u00e9trograde \u00e0 la 4e place malgr\u00e9 la hausse de plus de 50% des cours du brut.\u00c0 eux sept, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla, Facebook et Nvidia p\u00e8sent 11.888 milliards de dollars, soit 3.475 milliards de dollars de plus que fin d\u00e9cembre 2020. Ils ont donc contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 plus de la moiti\u00e9 (54%) de l'augmentation de la valorisation des 100 plus grandes capitalisations mondiales.Les tours de vis de P\u00e9kin plombent les g\u00e9ants chinoisLa deuxi\u00e8me puissance \u00e9conomique mondiale, la Chine, ne compte que 10 de ses repr\u00e9sentants dans ce palmar\u00e8s, dont 4 banques, contre 13 l'an dernier. L'ann\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 difficile pour de nombreux g\u00e9ants chinois de la technologie, cot\u00e9s pour la plupart \u00e0 Hong Kong et malmen\u00e9s par la volont\u00e9 de P\u00e9kin de r\u00e9glementer davantage le secteur. Les poids lourds chinois du num\u00e9rique comme Alibaba (-49% sur l'ann\u00e9e), Tencent (-19%), JD.com (-20%), ou encore le fabricant d'appareils \u00e9lectroniques Xiaomi (-43%) ont ainsi subi de lourdes pertes en 2021.Leur chute a \u00e9t\u00e9 exacerb\u00e9e par les craintes d'un d\u00e9faut de paiement du g\u00e9ant surendett\u00e9 de l'immobilier Evergrande (-90% depuis le 1er janvier) qui agitent les places asiatiques depuis le d\u00e9but de l' ann\u00e9e. R\u00e9sultat: le premier groupe chinois au palmar\u00e8s 2021, Tencent, glisse du 9e au 11e rang. Alibaba recule pour sa part de la 11e \u00e0 la 27e place.4 g\u00e9ants fran\u00e7ais du luxe dans le top 100Deux noms changent mais le compteur reste stable pour les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s fran\u00e7aises, 4 d'entre elles prenant de nouveau place au sein de ce top 100. La premi\u00e8re capitalisation europ\u00e9enne LVMH gagne 6 places et int\u00e8gre donc le top 20 (18e), tandis que le g\u00e9ant des cosm\u00e9tiques L'Or\u00e9al en grappille 4 pour atteindre le 36e rang. En hausse de pr\u00e8s de 75% sur les 12 derniers mois, Herm\u00e8s r\u00e9alise une entr\u00e9e fracassante dans ce top 100 (66e), tandis que Dior, holding cot\u00e9e d\u00e9tenant 41% de LVMH, profite de la flamb\u00e9e de sa filiale pour int\u00e9grer ce classement \u00e0 la 89e place.Sanofi (95e en 2020) et TotalEnergies (100e) quittent certes le palmar\u00e8s cette ann\u00e9e mais ils ne se sont pas effondr\u00e9s pour autant. Le g\u00e9ant fran\u00e7ais de l'\u00e9nergie affiche de fait une valorisation de 133,7 milliards de dollars \u00e0 la cl\u00f4ture de ce 31 d\u00e9cembre, en hausse de 16 milliards sur un an et \u00e0 moins de 4 milliards du 100e de cette \u00e9dition 2021, l'anglo-n\u00e9erlandais Unilever. Sanofi enregistre \u00e9galement une performance positive sur l'ann\u00e9e et pointe \u00e0 127 milliards de valorisation.La technologie, loin devant les compartiments pharmaceutique et bancaireOn peut \u00e9galement citer les t\u00e9l\u00e9communications (6) et les p\u00e9troli\u00e8res (4) parmi les autres principaux secteurs repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s.",

Seoul was also down, while Sydney and Wellington rose. Europe opened mixed, with London\u2019s FTSE slightly up while Paris and Frankfurt fell.In China, markets fell, in a slide analysts partly attributed to losses in shares of major liquor brands \u2013 including Kweichow Moutai, one of the world\u2019s biggest drinks companies.\u201cThe drop is mostly contributed by some blue chips, in particular the baijiu names,\u201d Zhang Gang, a strategist at Central China Securities, told Bloomberg. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that some funds want to cash out before the year-end after the recent rebound.\u201dHong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index was down as investors eyed uncertain prospects for 2022 as well as a continued debt crisis in the mainland\u2019s property market. A continued regulatory clampdown by Beijing on overseas listings by Chinese firms has also weighed down markets \u2013 though expectations that the country\u2019s central bank will add further stimulus in 2022 offered some hope.\u2018Fits and starts\u2019But trading volumes remain thin going into the new year, when prospects for global growth and the long-term impact of the Omicron variant are expected to become clearer.

One Hooters waitress has revealed the things she wishes customers would stop saying to her, and it\u2019s eye-opening to say the least.Ranging from comments about her appearance to urging her to smile more as she goes about her work, one Hooters employee told Insider all about the quips she is forced to contend with while at work.Hooters is infamous for the uniforms it require its wait staff to wear, as well as the heavy emphasis it places on the looks of its employees.The server told Insider that she commonly has comments directed at her such as \u201care you on the menu?\u201d, as well as other overtly sexual remarks.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you smiling\u201d is reportedly another phrase that the Hooters Girls hear a lot.\u201cYou\u2019re actively working, running around doing something, going back and forth and someone will literally stop me and say, \u2018Why aren\u2019t you smiling?

She says people often claim that Hooters is akin to a strip club, while others perpetuate the myth that \u201cHooters girls are dumb\u201d.\u201cI have a master\u2019s degree \u2014 this is my side job,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cMy manager from my first store was getting her nursing degree while she was a Hooters Girl.\u201dEarlier this year, we reported on the news that Hooters had backtracked on its new staff uniforms after employees blasted them as \u201csexist\u201d.H/T: Insider",

            "description": "Workers sort parcels at night in an e-commerce industrial park in Lianyungang, East China's Jiangsu Province on November 2. Photo: cnsphotoChina's Double 12 shopping festival, the country's year-end shopping bonanza that follows the Double 11 festival, raised the curtains on Sunday, yet this year's event is shorn of boasting and aggressive marketing campaigns by major e-commerce platforms amid tightened scrutiny over internet industry.The subdued version of the Double 12 shopping event is partly a result of both consumers' and merchants' pre-spending during Singles' Day, the world's largest shopping carnival, which saw sales hit a record high this year, and it also comes as companies ranging from e-commerce sites to livestream platforms launch promotions throughout the year that divert consumers' attention, industry insiders said.But such a turnaround does not equate to dwindling Chinese consumption power, analysts said. Chinese consumers' excitement remains, with demand shifting toward more high-quality and personalized items, and that will continue to serve as a ballast underpinning the growth of the world's second-largest economy.Competition among e-commerce platforms is largely absent in the Double 12 shopping festival this year, with much reduced promotional activity and a shorter sales period. Also, many e-commerce platforms did not release sales figures.A spokesperson for Suning told the Global Times on Sunday that promotions at the e-commerce platform this year are more targeted to satisfy different tastes, while consumption so far has shown a trend of high-end and greener purchases.For example, sales of home appliances priced above 6,000 yuan ($942) have expanded 79 percent year-on-year to date, and the sales of high-end beds are up 108 percent.Chinese e-commerce platform Tmall told the Global Times that it would launch several promotions during the Double 12 shopping festival. One representative move will be a sale of 19,800 bottles of Kweichow Moutai, China's top high-end baijiu, which is scheduled to begin at 8 pm on Sunday.\"We often say this year's Double 11 shopping festival opened in a low-profile manner, but it seems like the Double 12 is of little interest as well,\" Liu Dingding, a Beijing-based independent tech analyst, told the Global Times on Sunday.A manager of a US-listed Chinese e-commerce platform, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Global Times that the reason why it avoided this year's Double 12 shopping festival is that the company \"mobilized major resources\" during the Double 11 sales, which achieved record numbers.\"The coming January is another sales bonanza, as more Chinese will choose to stay at their working places to spend the Spring Festival holidays amid a resurgence of coronavirus cases. As demand will explode at that time, we decided to hit the brakes in December and then run in full swing next month,\" the manager explained, noting the company has strong confidence in the Chinese consumers' spending power.Such a philosophy is widely shared among Chinese consumers, some of whom used up their budgets ahead of December. \"Also, the discounts are not large enough to 'lure' me into spending again,\" a Beijing-based white-collar worker surnamed Wang told the Global Times.Analysts stressed that a slip in the event's public attention does not signal a retreat in either Chinese consumption power or a freeze of the e-commerce industry.\"This is an expected development as the internet economy this year entered a phase of adjustments. Although the growth rate may slow down, demand is still very robust and offers sheer size, and e-commerce platforms will pursue quality and innovative development to satisfy demand from market segments,\" Liu said, rejecting some Western media claims that lukewarm consumption could be a \"stigma\" on the Chinese economy.Livestreaming remains a hot spot of the Double 12 shopping festival. Ahead of the event, Chinese livestreaming top stars, including Li Jiaqi announced a list of items - from snacks, food and clothes to cosmetic products - that will be sold via livestreaming. The list soon jumped to the hot search ranks of China's social media platform Sina Weibo.During this year's annual Double 11 shopping festival, Chinese shoppers spend $139.1 billion, breaking last year's record despite the impact of the coronavirus epidemic.",

Depuis plus de 300 ans, cette eau-de-vie de c\u00e9r\u00e9ales (sorgho, bl\u00e9, riz, ma\u00efs) est produite \u00e0 Maotai, une ville de la r\u00e9gion du Guizhou, dans une distillerie qui emploie, excusez du peu, 30 000 personnes !Avec ses neuf passages de vapeur, ses huit fermentations et ses sept distillations successives (un process qui dure une ann\u00e9e enti\u00e8re), sa fabrication est aussi d\u00e9licate que celle d\u2019un produit de luxe. Le Moutai en est un de tout premier ordre en Chine. La preuve avec des prix stratosph\u00e9riques qui oscillent entre 300\u20ac pour l\u2019entr\u00e9e de gamme \u00e0 plusieurs milliers d\u2019euros pour des mill\u00e9sim\u00e9s (ils indiquent la date de mise en bouteille). Et ne parlons pas des flacons de collection qui d\u00e9passent le million aux ench\u00e8res !\u00bb A LIRE AUSSI : La Vague, le sak\u00e9 en ressac des Larmes du levantEn Chine, cette eau-de-vie repr\u00e9sente aujourd\u2019hui le symbole de la r\u00e9ussite \u00e9conomique, \u00e0 l\u2019instar d\u2019un sac Vuitton ou d\u2019un tailleur Chanel. C\u2019est un signe, la capitalisation boursi\u00e8re de Kweichow Moutai (400 milliards de $) d\u00e9passe d\u00e9sormais celle de LVMH et de Pernod-Ricard ou de Diageo pour rester dans le secteur des spiritueux. Qu\u2019en penserait Mao qui avait intronis\u00e9 cette eau-de-vie, alcool officiel, et outil diplomatique, de la R\u00e9publique Populaire de Chine d\u00e8s sa fondation en 1949 ?Selon Alexandre Vingtier, expert en spiritueux, \u00abcette eau-de-vie est certes une r\u00e9ussite \u00e9conomique exemplaire mais il ne faut pas oublier sa puissance aromatique incomparable. Et \u00e0 l\u2019heure o\u00f9 l\u2019environnement est au centre des pr\u00e9occupations, sa fabrication toujours 100 % artisanale en fait le plus ancien alcool bio au monde. Enfin, et ce n\u2019est pas le moindre de ses atouts, le Moutai accompagne parfaitement les cuisines chinoises riches en \u00e9pices. D\u2019ailleurs, comme le vin, cet alcool \u00e9volue apr\u00e8s sa mise en bouteilles, deux \u00e0 trois ans sont n\u00e9cessaires pour qu\u2019il d\u00e9livre toute son intensit\u00e9\u00bb.Paradoxe, le Moutai est moins cher en France qu\u2019en Chine mais il faut tout de m\u00eame compter 200\u20ac les 37, 5 cl pour le classique Flying Fairy 53\u00b0. Pour les amateurs, curieux de d\u00e9couvrir ce spiritueux hors normes, dans tous les sens du terme, une gamme plus abordable, la Moutai Chun, vient d\u2019arriver (entre 30 et 45\u20ac).

The distillery will produce Diageo\u2019s first Chinese-origin, single malt whisky targeting the country\u2019s \u201cpremium\u201d drinkers, the company said.Premium alcohol \u2014 including Moutai\u2019s prized baijiu and Budweiser Brewing Co. APAC Ltd.\u2019s premium and super premium brews \u2014 has significantly outperformed China\u2019s overall liquor sales in the past few years, even as the pandemic kept consumers away from restaurants and bars.\u201cChina continues to be an attractive market for us with the increased consumption occasions, the fast-growing middle class and the rising appreciation for whisky,\u201d Sam Fischer, president of Diageo Asia Pacific and Global Travel, told Bloomberg in an interview.International retailers are upgrading their offerings to meet the demands of a growing Chinese middle class eager for more expensive products from luxury handbags and cosmetics to higher-end beer and imported steak. Global businesses operating in China are increasingly looking toward future growth in the world\u2019s largest consumer market as the pandemic drags down sentiment in other areas of the world.Fischer said some details of Diageo\u2019s new whisky \u2014 including pricing and launch information \u2014 hadn\u2019t been decided as the liquor will need to mature for at least three years following the Yunnan distillery\u2019s completion, according to Diageo. Still, it will be priced \u201cwell above\u201d a whisky jointly produced by Diageo and Chinese baijiu distiller Jiangsu Yanghe Brewery Joint-Stock Co., which sells at about $50 for a half-liter bottle.Diageo\u2019s China ambitions are based on whisky\u2019s solid sales growth in the mainland over the past five years. The country\u2019s $1.7 billion whisky market \u2014 though far smaller than the $150 billion local spirits category mostly composed of baijiu \u2014 posted high single-digit growth annually from 2016 to 2019, with just a slight drop last year amid the pandemic, according to Euromonitor International.Rival Pernod Ricard SA announced plans in 2019 to debut a new made-in-China line of malt whisky by 2023 at the earliest and build its first malt whisky distillery in the country, in Sichuan province.China ChallengeDiageo, the owner of Johnnie Walker and Singleton, faces a key challenge in China: making whisky a desirable option for group gatherings and gift-giving holidays where baijiu has long played a key role.\u201cSpecifically, there are cultural occasions in China such as Chinese New Year and Mid-Autumn festival,\u201d Fischer said. \u201cNow our goal will be to make whisky more relevant to those occasions as well.\u201dThe distillery will be carbon neutral and recycle the water it uses, the company said, and it will have a visitor center for whisky fans.Earlier this year, Diageo opened a logistics center in Shenzhen and announced the construction of a Shanghai-based research and development center it said would strengthen its ability to develop premium products catering to Chinese tastes.\u201cOur performance has been super on the back of that belief over the last three, four years in China,\u201d Fischer said. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to invest to develop our brands so that we can play into that long-term growth potential.\u201dContact editor Bob Simison (hello@caixin.com)Download our app to receive breaking news alerts and read the news on the go.Get our weekly free Must-Read newsletter.",

            "description": "Hong Kong CNN Business \u2014Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s national campaign for \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d has cast a shadow over an industry that counts the country as one of its biggest markets: luxury goods.Xi\u2019s push to redistribute wealth in the world\u2019s second-largest economy has unsettled some luxury market investors. The sector still bears scars from a sweeping government crackdown on corruption several years ago and is now relying on Chinese consumers more than ever.Shoppers in mainland China are vital to brands such as LVMH, Hermes and Gucci. Last year, as the coronavirus pandemic took hold worldwide, China\u2019s case numbers remained relatively low and the country\u2019s share of the global luxury market roughly doubled, according to consultancy Bain. The firm predicts that China will become the world\u2019s biggest market by 2025, overtaking Europe and the United States.The latest government initiative \u2014 which coincides with a regulatory crackdown on industries from technology and education to gaming and entertainment \u2014 has raised concerns. But experts are divided on whether \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d will hurt luxury sales, which total hundreds of billions of dollars a year.Many analysts believe the campaign could actually be good for business. While Xi\u2019s plans are still taking shape, his government has made clear that it ultimately wants to raise the incomes of more households and expand the middle class. That, in turn, could help increase purchasing power and consumption.But experts haven\u2019t ruled out the possibility of the government clamping down on signs of perceived extravagance or raising taxes on the rich, which could darken the outlook for makers of high-end handbags, shoes and jewelry.\u201cInitially when it was announced, people panicked,\u201d Zuzanna Pusz, a UBS analyst, said of the \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d pledge. \u201cAnd the market panicked. Because everyone kind of went back with their memory to the anti-graft campaign, and how the luxury demand back then was impacted.\u201dShoppers walking past a Gucci store in Hong Kong. Budrul Chukrut/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty ImagesSome players have already taken a hit. Shares of LVMH slid 7.9% from August to September, while Kering, the owner of Gucci, fell 19.4% over the same period.\u201cIn the past three months, the [luxury] sector has underperformed the European market \u2026 on the back of renewed China concerns,\u201d including the wealth redistribution campaign, a flare-up in coronavirus cases and regulation, Citi analysts wrote in an October report.The call for \u2018common prosperity\u2019Beijing has been tightening the screws on private enterprise over the past year.But the ante was upped in August, when Xi told top leaders from the ruling Chinese Communist Party that the government should establish a system to redistribute wealth in the interest of \u201csocial fairness.\u201dAccording to state news agency Xinhua, Xi said that it was \u201cnecessary\u201d to \u201creasonably regulate excessively high incomes, and encourage high-income people and enterprises to return more to society.\u201d State media has suggested that the government could consider taxation or other ways of redistributing income and wealth.Some companies have taken the hint from Beijing. In recent months, several of China\u2019s biggest tech firms have pledged to donate billions of dollars to the cause, including Alibaba (BABA) and Tencent (TCEHY). One company, Pinduoduo (PDD), even promised to hand over its entire profit for the second quarter.There have been signs of apprehension within the luxury world. Recently, the sector has lost favor with some investors, which \u201csuggests that short-term China-related uncertainty has been priced in,\u201d UBS analysts wrote in a September report.\u201cThe impact of China\u2019s common prosperity initiatives on luxury consumption \u2026 remains investors\u2019 key concern,\u201d they added.But analysts at the Swiss bank also note that \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d is not a new concept in China.Use of the phrase stretches back to the time of Chairman Mao Zedong, who invoked \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d when advocating for dramatic economic reforms to take power away from rich landlords and farmers, the rural elite.Shoppers in an upscale retail plaza in Beijing in August. Many analysts believe the \"common prosperity\" campaign could be good for business, by raising the incomes of households and expanding the middle class. Qilai Shen/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesIn 2012, \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d was \u201cdeemed the \u2018fundamental principle\u2019 of Chinese socialism\u201d at a major Communist Party gathering, noted Tao Wang, a UBS economist, in a report to clients.Analysts at the bank also say they expect just \u201cmodest and gradual\u201d adjustments in personal income tax and consumption tax in the next few years, suggesting that \u201cthe negative impact may be limited and not imminent.\u201dSome top executives have addressed the issue directly.Earlier this month, LVMH Chief Financial Officer Jean Jacques Guiony said that he was \u201cnot particularly worried or concerned with the recent announcement.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t see any reason to believe that this could be detrimental to the upper middle class, affluent class that is the bulk of our customer base,\u201d he told analysts. \u201cTherefore, this seems to us not to be negative \u2014 if not positive.\u201dLast week, Nicolas Hieronimus, CEO of L\u2019Oreal, which owns brands such as Giorgio Armani Beauty and Lanc\u00f4me, also weighed in.\u201cWe remain very confident for China,\u201d he said on a corporate sales call, adding that the \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d pledge would likely help make the country\u2019s middle class \u201cwealthier and bigger, [which] is very positive for us.\u201dA sensitive subjectIndustry observers, though, have good reason to worry.Less than a decade ago, the luxury industry was hit hard by a massive anti-corruption drive in China. The government stamped out any sign of lavish spending among officials, including on luxury goods.The campaign, rolled out by Xi in 2012, had a dramatic impact on the sector. In 2013, mainland China\u2019s luxury market grew just 2%, compared to 7% the previous year, according to Bain.Some fashion brands were eschewed as shoppers looked for less conspicuous logos or designs. People \u201cdon\u2019t want to just walk around with big LVs anymore,\u201d Patricia Pao, CEO of the Pao Principle, a consultant for luxury brands in China, told CNN at the time.Shoppers lining up to enter a Louis Vuitton store in Nanjing, in east China's Jiangsu province, in August. Feature China/Barcroft Media/Getty ImagesPremium liquor brands, such as baijiu maker Kweichow Moutai, also saw sales drop off significantly. The company later said that the campaign led to \u201cunprecedented pressure\u201d on the alcohol industry.The sector is still facing regulatory concerns, and was recently hit by a sell-off in shares.During the 2012 anti-corruption crusade, swanky hotels suffered, too, as officials called off banquets and conferences. Some five-star hotels at the time even asked to drop down a star, in hopes that the lower ratings would allow them to appear less opulent and retain business, Chinese state media reported.It doesn\u2019t help that businesses ranging from the booming tech sector to private education in China have lately been targeted with another crackdown, which has spilled over into the entertainment and live-stream shopping industries.Pusz, the UBS analyst, said that may have contributed to some unease.\u201cBecause obviously there has been quite a bit of news flow in the market about several other industries being impacted by various measures of the Chinese government, I think there was a bit of anticipation from people, [like]: \u2018Okay, what if luxury comes next?\u2019\u201d she said.Times have changedSome analysts, though, think this crackdown could be different.According to the latest estimates from Bain, shoppers in China account for 35% of all luxury sales worldwide. By 2025, the firm suggests that could shoot up to nearly 50%.Bruno Lannes, a partner with Bain\u2019s consumer products and retail practices who is based in Shanghai, said his firm isn\u2019t changing its forecasts because of the \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d pledge.\u201cIt\u2019s too early to say, but there is no real indication that this has a major impact, I think, on the brands,\u201d he told CNN Business.Lannes expects the latest policy could have a \u201cneutral\u201d or \u201cpositive\u201d effect on luxury consumption, particularly if incomes grow across the country as a result.\u201cI think it\u2019s very different from what happened [with] the anti-corruption campaign back then,\u201d he added.Previously, many luxury brands in China were driven by the tradition of executives or officials giving or receiving gifts, which was a huge target of the campaign, Lannes noted. Now, consumption is largely \u201cby people who consume for themselves or for their relatives,\u201d he said.Some consumers may already be starting to hold back on spending, however.According to LookLook, a consumer research firm that works with luxury brands, 1 in 10 respondents to a recent survey of 100 luxury buyers in China cited the government crackdown on excessive shows of wealth as a reason they were not spending as much these days.One participant of the study, which was released in September, cited a desire to not \u201cattract unwanted attention,\u201d according to LookLook CEO Malinda Sanna.\u201cWe\u2019ve never heard that before,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the demand is definitely still there, but they\u2019re being cautious.\u201d\u2014 Laura He contributed to this report.",

            "description": "Capital has flooded into China\u2019s \u201cbaijiu\u201d industry, leading to sky-high valuations even as some companies struggle to maintain decent profit growth. Photo: IC PhotoThe new top man at the world\u2019s most valuable liquor company means business.During a shareholder\u2019s meeting last month, Kweichow Moutai Co. Ltd.\u2019s (600519.SH) new Chairman Ding Xiongjun pledged a series of long-term reforms to make the distiller the first Fortune Global 500 company based in Guizhou, one of China\u2019s poorest provinces.But these ambitious targets from the company come as the market faces slowing sales growth, increasing regulatory scrutiny of stocks seen as bloated with capital and a potential industry-wide consolidation.The 47-year-old former director of the Guizhou Provincial Energy Bureau took over from his predecessor Gao Weidong, who was removed just 18 months into the job in August, marking the latest shakeup after a series of graft scandals at the country\u2019s leading producer of \u201cbaijiu.\u201d At the meeting, Ding pushed for reforms to corporate management, asset management, as well as marketing and pricing, according to a WeChat post (link in Chinese) published by the baijiu-maker.Moutai is far from the only baijiu-maker looking to adjust its business to the tougher market, which has seen the giant\u2019s profit growth in the first half dwindle to just over 9%, the lowest in five years, excluding 2020 when the pandemic disrupted operations.Rivals including Luzhou Laojiao Co. Ltd. (000568.SZ) and Shede Spirits Co. Ltd. (600702. SH) have been cutting costs by laying off sales staff in order to meet profit growth targets, according to a distributor of another leading brand, Wuliangye Yibin Co. Ltd. (000858.SZ).A worker adjusts the packaging of jars of baijiu in Zunyi, Southwest China\u2019s Guizhou province, in May 2020. Photo: VCGDistillers are also starting to directly manage sales channels to bolster efficiency. Companies including Shede, Sichuan Swellfun Co. Ltd. (600779 SH) and Sichuan Jiannanchun Group Co. Ltd. have been consolidating their scattered distributors into single companies that oversee sales in a particular region. Moutai has long been trying to strengthen management of its existing sales channels to give it more control over prices.The licenses to distribute Moutai, which are tightly controlled, had in the past been handed out by some senior managers in exchange for political and financial gain, such as in the case of former boss Yuan Renguo, who was sentenced to life in prison last month for illegally accepting cash and properties worth 112.9 million yuan ($17.7 million).\u201cIt is unscientific to deviate from the law of value. Moutai will follow the laws of the market, respond to market signals, and reflect its value reasonably,\u201d Ding was quoted as saying at the meeting in a report by Sina Public Company Research Institute (link in Chinese).The chairman\u2019s comments were seen as a signal that the company will be raising factory-gate prices including for its signature Feitian Moutai, which has remained at 969 yuan a half-liter for the past three and a half years and has a recommended \u2014 but not mandatory \u2014 resale ceiling of 1,499 yuan. Market prices are currently at around 3,000 yuan per bottle due to high demand and distributors\u2019 aggressive hoarding.Stock volatility sparks regulatory riskBaijiu, a clear spirit made from fermenting sorghum or other grains such as barley, corn, rice and wheat, is mostly consumed within China\u2019s borders. The liquor comes at all price points, from gallon jugs costing a handful of yuan to highly-sought after Feitian Moutai, often served at state banquets and presented as a diplomatic gift.The value of baijiu stocks meanwhile had been surging for the past four years, until recent volatility.Kweichow Moutai\u2019s stock crossed the 1,000 yuan-milestone on June 27, 2019, giving the distiller a 1.26 trillion yuan valuation at the time. The 19 baijiu-focused Chinese liquor producers listed on the mainland soared between 20% and 326% for the entire year of 2020, according to data compiled by Caixin.The trend continued in the first half of this year, with the benchmark CSI Liquor Index surging as much as 5.7% and closing at a record high of 21,000 on Feb. 10, a day before the Lunar New Year holiday. However, the index tumbled following the festivities to a low of 14,108 before mounting a recovery through April and May.The roller-coaster ride didn\u2019t stop there.Just as investors were getting comfortable, liquor stocks began a major retreat on June 7 \u2014 though not before the index set a record high of 21,438.35. It continued to slip throughout July and bottomed out at 14,314 after tumbling 7.7% on Aug. 20. Moutai shares sunk to 1,525 yuan, a significant drop from their Feb. 18 peak of 2,627.88 yuan, while rival Wuliangye fell 7.3% from the previous day, inflicting losses on fund managers and retail investors alike.In fact, the sell-off on Aug. 20 was triggered by a symposium held that morning by the State Administration for Market Regulation, which noted the volatility and high valuations of baijiu stocks.A source at a securities firm told Caixin that the event \u2014 attended by representatives from liquor firms and their investors and scheduled right before two national holidays when baijiu prices normally rise \u2014 sought to rein in both retail and stock prices, and sent a regulatory signal to control investor enthusiasm for spirit-makers.\u201cThe flood of capital into the liquor market has raised concerns from many parties,\u201d the person said. \u201cThis round of regulatory control is aimed at cooling down the primary market (where companies are rushing to go public) by knocking down the prices of the secondary market (where companies\u2019 shares are publicly traded). Companies won\u2019t be allowed to go public when the market is this overheated.\u201dA person at a mutual fund said measures such as restrictions on investment in the baijiu market and financing activities in related fields, as well as postponements of companies\u2019 listings, could be possible.A person in charge of a midsize distiller in Maotai \u2014 a Guizhou town famous for its baijiu, home to Kweichow Moutai and more than 1,700 other producers \u2014 told Caixin that recently the local government had banned sales staff of liquor companies from promoting investment opportunities on social media platforms including Weibo, WeChat and Douyin.In a notice (link in Chinese) published on Oct. 5, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission ordered banks to ramp up funding to coal miners and energy companies amid a power supply crunch, and explicitly warned against using business and consumer loans to invest in luxury consumer goods, including Moutai and expensive Pu\u2019er tea, in order to prevent \u201cthe disorderly expansion of capital.\u201dAt the end of the second quarter, managers had cut allocations to the liquor sector from 15.9% to 13.9% from the previous quarter, according to data compiled by Zhongtai Securities. Specifically, funds have cut their holdings of the top three baijiu stocks Kweichow Moutai, Wuliangye, and Luzhou Laojiao by 1.31, 0.54 and 0.52 percentage points respectively during the quarter, noted Snowball Finance (link in Chinese), a finance information portal.Sales propped up by price hikesThe concern over baijiu valuations, according to another mutual fund source, was connected to the slowing growth of major baijiu distillers, especially Moutai, as half-year earnings were weak even as stock prices soared.Fellow first-tier distiller Wuliangye reported a 19.5% growth in revenue and a 21.6% growth in net profit in the first half of this year, compared with 26.7% and 31% growth respectively in the same period in 2019. Another top producer, Jiangsu Yanghe Brewery Joint-Stock Co. Ltd. (002304.SZ), reported a 15.8% increase in revenue and a 4.8% increase in net profit in the first half, compared with 10% and 11.5% in the same period in 2019.\u201cThe average price-to-earnings ratio had been at about 50 times company earnings, far exceeding the manufacturing industry average,\u201d a person at a private equity fund said.\u201cRegardless of how popular sauce-fragrance baijiu (\u9171\u9999\u578b\u767d\u9152) may appear, total output of baijiu is declining every year,\u201d the above Wuliangye distributor said, referring to the prestigious liquor class that Moutai belongs to.A government crackdown in 2012 on officials\u2019 luxury spending hit distillers hard, especially Moutai which is often used in business gift-giving. Almost 70% of distillers were forced to halt or cut production between 2012 and 2017. Given baijiu\u2019s production cycle \u2014 which runs to about five years for sauce-fragrance varieties \u2014 the effects of this sudden cut to demand on production are still being felt.According to official figures (link in Chinese), Chinese distillers produced 7.4 million kiloliters (2.6 million tons) of liquor in 2020, representing a drop of 2.46% from a year before and a decline for the fourth consecutive year.Luzhou Laojiao saw its total sales volume fall 15% last year to 120,900 tons, while market price per ton increased 43.4%. The major Sichuan province distiller produced 111,400 tons of liquor in 2020, compared with 156,800 tons in 2018. Wuliangye lowered its output by 17% to 158,800 tons in 2020 from 192,000 tons in 2018.Similarly, sales of the flagship Moutai and Kweichow Moutai\u2019s other products slipped by 0.72% and 1.13% respectively, while market price per ton was up 13% and 6% on the back of more direct sales and high-price special edition bottles such as a range themed around the Chinese zodiac.The only thing keeping the baijiu titans\u2019 revenue from dipping along with production is the seemingly insatiable demand for luxury booze, with has allowed prices to keep rising.China Merchants Securities Co. Ltd. said in an August research report that output from distillers is likely to keep falling while unit prices will continue to increase. Zheshang Securities Co. Ltd. similarly pointed out in May that sales may continue to decline in the next five years.Moutai raising its prices could help with its profit growth, the Sina report noted, saying that by increasing the price per bottle by 20%, the company can boost its revenue by 11.6 billion yuan, a 12% increase from last year.\u201cBased on historical data, price adjustments [made by Moutai] over the years are often accompanied by performance growth. The problem is, we don\u2019t know when, or if, it will materialize,\u201d it said.The sector has now reached a point where a differentiation is likely to emerge. Liquor analyst Cai Xuefei pointed out that distillers with a solid quality foundation will continue to see decent growth while small and midsize distillers focusing on more modestly priced mid-range and lower-end products could lose favor with investors.Contact reporter Kelsey Cheng (kelseycheng@caixin.com) and editor Joshua Dummer (joshuadummer@caixin.com)Download our app to receive breaking news alerts and read the news on the go.Get our weekly free Must-Read newsletter.",

            "description": "NewsBy Sarah NeishJapanese whiskey, made using the Bourbon method from domestic corn grown in Hokkaido, could shake up the international spirits scene.Japanese distilleries are collaborating on a new style of domestic whiskey using the Bourbon method. While the spirit will not be able to carry the name Bourbon, as this is a protected term reserved for barrel-aged whiskies produced in the state of Kentucky, the Japanese whiskey will share many similarities to its American counterpart.Thought to be the country\u2019s first corn-based whiskey, the variety hails from the region of Hokkaido, which is where the lion\u2019s share of Japan\u2019s corn is produced.Hokkaido Liberty Whisky is working on the project in cooperation with two other distilleries and the Hokkaido Research Organisation in Japan\u2019s northernmost prefecture. The endeavour involves blending corn with a touch of barley and the region\u2019s famous water, and is thought to be the first whiskey ever made in Japan, using the Bourbon method.\u201cIn the future, it may even be possible to age the whiskey in barrels made with wood from Hokkaido,\u201d Hidekuni Hayashi, owner of Hokkaido Liberty Whisky, told South China Morning Post.Until now, the majority of corn grown in Japan has been used for animal feed, but Shigemasa Shimizu, who is overseeing the project, believes that through \u201ccombining corn with the other ingredients that are here \u2013 pure water, a little rye and our cool climate \u2013 we can produce a good whiskey.\u201dWhile an official name for the new style of whiskey is yet to be decided, Hokkaido Liberty is aiming to release the first batch in 2026.If it proves successful, the venture could impact US Bourbon exports to Japan. However, competitive pricing is likely to be an issue as small batch production of a \u2018Bourbon-style\u2019 Japanese whisky could set prices high for domestic consumers. But its developers say there is potential to piggy-back on the global reputation and marketing clout of Nikka Whisky in order to raise its profile.",

            "description": "NewsBy Lucy ShawThe South Shields-born executive chef of The Ritz London on searching for missing partridges during a royal banquet, being inspired by The Galloping Gourmet, and why foie gras and Yquem is the perfect match.Describe your earliest food memory\u2026.Stealing Farley\u2019s Rusks from my younger twin siblings and eating them under the bed when I was three. A few years later, when my dad was out catching fish, my mum asked me to help her with the Sunday lunch by preparing the Jersey Royals. When I\u2019d made the mint sauce, she gave me four of the biggest potatoes with melted butter on top, which is one of my favourite things to eat to this day. When they\u2019re in season my team have to hide them from me so I don\u2019t devour them.Did you always dream of becoming a chef or did you fall into it?I grew up watching The Galloping Gourmet and Graham Kerr intrigued me. He was a very charismatic character and used to invite the most beautiful ladies in the audience up try his dishes while he enjoyed a glass of wine. He always had a huge grin on his face and it made me hungry to be part of that world. From the age of 14 I was allowed to go to college one day a week to be taught how to cook by a professional chef.What is it about the catering industry that has kept you hooked?I love making people happy \u2013 there\u2019s no better feeling. I\u2019m in a fortunate position to be the executive chef of The Ritz, so I get to chat with our guests after service \u2013 it\u2019s a thrill to think that you\u2019re making people happy \u2013 that\u2019s what hospitality is all about. The higher up you get the more enjoyable the job is. Cooking is a tough industry though \u2013 you can\u2019t cut corners or it will have a knock-on effect on the flavour of your dishes. It\u2019s all about a lot of simple tasks done well.What is the dish that you have created that you\u2019re most proud of?My langoustines \u00e0 la nage, made with jumbo Scottish langoustine tails, which is a dish I\u2019ve been refining for 30 years. The inspiration for it came from fishing trips with my father, who used to treat me Dublin Bay prawns. I used to suck on the claw meat like a lollipop.I cook the langoustine for a minute-and-a-half in salt water and make a sauce from the shells with a splash of white Burgundy and Noilly Prat vermouth, reducing it down then adding lemon juice, lemon verbena, whipped butter and a touch of cream to thicken it. I place the trio of tails on the plate and pull the claw meat out with tweezers, finishing the dish with lemon verbena, tarragon, and cauliflower pur\u00e9e topped with fennel, carrot, radish, celery and baby leeks. The dish is delicate to preserve the beautiful flavour of the langoustines.What is your ultimate food and wine match?Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019Yquem and foie gras. My favourite experience of the pairing was at Chevre d\u2019Or in the south of France, which is built into the side of a mountain overlooking the Riviera. I can\u2019t remember the vintage of Yquem, but it was unctuous, fresh and fragrant with a long finish. It harmonised perfectly with the richness of the foie gras, which was served on brioche with a Sauternes jelly.What is the most memorable meal you\u2019ve ever had in your life?When I was 24, my boss took me on a gastronomic tour of France that included La Maison Troisgros and Maison Pic, the highlight of which was lunch at Georges Blanc in Vonnas followed by dinner at Restaurant Paul Bocuse in Collonges-au-Mont-d\u2019Or \u2013 these guys were culinary gods and they made a real impression on me. It was bucketing it down when we arrived at Georges Blanc, so the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 ran out with umbrellas. The restaurant was housed in a beautiful building full of tapestries and object d\u2019art. There was a TV crew filming during our visit.Our feast included a \u2018terrine gourmand\u2019 made with layers of foie gras, artichoke, chicken and truffle, set in a jelly, which blew my mind. We were also served a stunning crayfish dish and Bresse chicken with morels, which I still rate as the finest in the world, enjoyed with lashings of Burgundy.I remember thinking the food felt light-years ahead of what we had in the UK. The meal ended with local cheeses and samples of the puddings from the restaurant\u2019s two dessert trollies. I missed Bocuse at dinner, so went to see him the next day \u2013 we enjoyed a Kir Royale at 10:30am. He tapped me on the head in what felt like a blessing, telling me that achieving success in the catering industry is a marathon not a sprint.What\u2019s the weirdest thing you\u2019ve eaten while on your travels?Live ants at Noma in Copenhagen. I didn\u2019t think I was going to like them but they had an intense citrus flavour that was quite pleasant. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d eat them again though\u2026Who is your culinary hero and why?Auguste Escoffier \u2013 my cooking technique is based on his culinary principals. Too few chefs in the UK acknowledge that we are where we are today because of him. I\u2019m a disciple of Escoffier \u2013 we have a lot to thank the French for. Escoffier was very forward thinking. In order to stay relevant to today\u2019s diners we have to cook in the classic style but with modern touches.What\u2019s the biggest blunder you\u2019ve made while on the job?Around 35 years ago, while in my previous job, we were preparing our first plated banquet for the Queen and I was second in command. We had to do roast partridge for 90 people, which is a fiddly dish with a lot of elements, so just about the worst thing to serve at a banquet. The team started plating up and after a while we ran out of birds but the plates kept coming, so I went downstairs to collect them from the hot plate, walking slowly so as not to arouse suspicions.I couldn\u2019t find them, so ran to the kitchen and asked the sous chef to fling a few partridges into the fryer. I felt sick and was mentally writing my resignation letter. I went back to the hot plate for a final look and found the birds there. I scooped them up and sprinted back to the plating room. I was later told that the Queen didn\u2019t get wind of the mistake, but it felt like the end of the world at the time.What is your favourite season for food?Spring without doubt, but I also love autumn. There\u2019s something so exciting about spring, when you get the first veg of the year, and your first lamb, wild salmon and beautiful shellfish. It\u2019s lovely seeing these elements come to life \u2013 spring morels are one of the most divine things ever. In spring I\u2019m always looking forward to what\u2019s coming into season next.What single ingredient do you rely on most in the kitchen?Vanilla, as we use a hell of a lot of it in our pastries. We use fresh Madagascan vanilla pods in our puds \u2013 vanilla is the foundation of pastry in the way a good stock is the foundation of savoury dishes. We use it to create layers of flavour.What is the best bottle of wine you\u2019ve ever drunk?It\u2019s hard to choose just one \u2013 I\u2019ve enjoyed fine bottles of Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion with Sarah Jane Staines, who used to run the Royal Academy of Culinary Arts, as it was her favourite red. I have three bottles of Cheval Blanc that I\u2019m waiting for the right moment to open. Drinking Sassicaia at the estate with Marchese Nicol\u00f2 Incisa della Rocchetta was a very special moment. When it comes to Champagne, Krug is hard to beat but I also love Taittinger Comtes de Champagne and Laurent-Perrier Alexandra Ros\u00e9.What is your guilty pleasure food?French fries sprinkled in salt \u2013if I see them on the hot plate it\u2019s hard for me not to eat them. And chocolate of any kind as I have a sweet tooth.If you had to only eat one country\u2019s cuisine for the rest of your life, what would it be and why?It would have to be French \u2013 British cuisine today is so much better that it was, which I put down to the French chefs working in the grand hotels in the \u201870s who taught us how to cook. Guys like Michel Bourdin at The Connaught, the Roux brothers and Pierre Koffmann were all great teachers who highlighted the importance of working with quality ingredients.",

As pol\u00edticas s\u00e3o impulsionadas pelo desejo de controle do Estado, bem como por preocupa\u00e7\u00f5es com d\u00edvidas, desigualdade e influ\u00eancia de pa\u00edses estrangeiros, incluindo os Estados Unidos. As informa\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o do jornal The New York Times.Encorajado pelo crescente nacionalismo por seu sucesso com a covid-19, Xi Jinping est\u00e1 reformulando o mundo dos neg\u00f3cios na China \u00e0 sua pr\u00f3pria imagem, o que significa, principalmente, controle. Antes, os executivos tinham sinal verde para crescer a todo custo. Agora, as autoridades querem ditar quais setores prosperam, quais fracassam e de que forma isso acontece.publicidadeEssas mudan\u00e7as oferecem um vislumbre da vis\u00e3o do l\u00edder chin\u00eas para a gest\u00e3o da economia antes de uma reuni\u00e3o pol\u00edtica que deve solidificar seus planos para um 3\u00ba mandato sem precedentes.O objetivo \u00e9 corrigir problemas estruturais, como o excesso de endividamento e as desigualdades, al\u00e9m de gerar um crescimento mais equilibrado. As medidas marcam o fim de uma era de ouro para as empresas privadas que transformaram a China em uma pot\u00eancia manufatureira e um centro de inova\u00e7\u00e3o.Economistas fazem um alerta: governos autorit\u00e1rios t\u00eam um hist\u00f3rico duvidoso com esse tipo de transforma\u00e7\u00e3o. No entanto, eles reconhecem que poucos empregam tantos recursos e planejamento no esfor\u00e7o de mudan\u00e7a.Em setembro, credores se preocuparam com o destino da maior empreiteira da China, a Evergrande. A gigante do setor imobili\u00e1rio admitiu que pode n\u00e3o ter capacidade de assumir suas obriga\u00e7\u00f5es, superiores a US$ 300 bilh\u00f5es, o que motivou protestos na China. Enquanto isso, nenhuma autoridade mencionou a possibilidade de ajudar.A empresa n\u00e3o \u00e9 a \u00fanica passando por dificuldades. As autoridades detiveram 2 executivos de alto escal\u00e3o do grupo HNA, conglomerado de log\u00edstica e transporte endividado, e condenaram o presidente do Kweichow Moutai Group, uma empresa de bebidas de luxo, a pris\u00e3o perp\u00e9tua por aceitar propinas.Segundo o fundador da Xiaomi, fabricante de smartphones, as grandes empresas de internet devem ajudar as menores. Sua companhia tem um novo plano de US$ 15,5 bilh\u00f5es para ajudar pequenos neg\u00f3cios e regi\u00f5es subdesenvolvidas.\u201cA pr\u00f3pria defini\u00e7\u00e3o do que significa desenvolvimento na China est\u00e1 mudando\u201d, afirma Yuen Yuen Ang, professora de ci\u00eancia pol\u00edtica na Universidade de Michigan em entrevista ao The New York Times. \u201cNas \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas, o modelo era simples: era aquele que priorizava a velocidade de crescimento acima de todas as outras quest\u00f5es.\u201d\u201cEst\u00e1 claro agora que Xi quer acabar com a era dourada e avan\u00e7ar em dire\u00e7\u00e3o a uma vers\u00e3o chinesa da era progressiva, com um crescimento mais justo e menos corrupto\u201d, acrescenta.Analistas defendem que algumas medidas, como redu\u00e7\u00e3o da d\u00edvida e coibir o comportamento anticompetitivo entre as plataformas de internet, s\u00e3o necess\u00e1rias h\u00e1 muito tempo. Entretanto, eles receiam que as novas pol\u00edticas prejudiquem a competitividade e favore\u00e7am o setor estatal, que \u00e9 ineficiente e dominado por monop\u00f3lios.De acordo com Natasha Kassam, diretora do Lowy Institute, um think thank australiano, o dinamismo do setor privado pode sofrer. Ela compara o movimento atual \u00e0s mudan\u00e7as que Jinping adotou no in\u00edcio de seu mandato, 9 anos atr\u00e1s, durante a campanha anticorrup\u00e7\u00e3o.\u201cDurante a campanha anticorrup\u00e7\u00e3o, ningu\u00e9m sabia quem seria o pr\u00f3ximo alvo. Isso levou \u00e0 in\u00e9rcia. As autoridades estavam com receio de tomar decis\u00f5es, com medo de estarem erradas. Haver\u00e1 um efeito parecido no setor privado\u201d, afirma ao The New York Times."

The red-and-white bottles of its flagship product, \u201cFeitian,\u201d or \u201cFlying Fairy,\u201d are a staple at Chinese state banquets and business events. It was also known to be the favorite tipple of Mao Zedong, founder of Communist China.The court said that Yuan had confessed to most of his crimes and was therefore \u201cpunished lightly,\u201d adding that all his private property had been confiscated.Yuan\u2019s sentencing serves as a stark reminder of Beijing\u2019s long-running clampdown on corruption, which has affected Moutai previously.In 2013, the company\u2019s sales slumped and its share price tumbled when President Xi Jinping embarked on a drive to stamp out extravagant spending among officials, including on expensive liquor.Still, it remains one of China\u2019s most valuable companies with a market capitalization bigger than the combined value of global distillers ABInBev, Diageo (DEO) and Heineken (HEINY).A worker at the Kweichow Moutai distillery in Maotai, located in Renhuai in southwest China's Guizhou Province. Ou Dongqu/Xinhua/Getty ImagesChina regularly investigates powerful executives for corruption \u2014 while using the findings to send a warning to others. In January, a Chinese court sentenced the former chairman of one of China\u2019s biggest asset management companies, Lai Xiaomin, to death after finding him guilty of bribery.Yuan\u2019s sentencing takes place against a wider crackdown on private enterprise by Xi, which has squeezed China\u2019s tech giants and heaped pressure on prominent business leaders, such as Jack Ma of Alibaba (BABA).\u2014 Shawn Deng, Laura He and Michelle Toh contributed reporting.",

Net profit rose 9.08 percent year-on-year to 24.654 billion yuan, equivalent to 270 million yuan in daily earnings and accounting for a quarter of the liquor industry in China.",

            "description": "While Asia loves beer, some moments call for something a little harder.Some fans of spirits enjoy learning about the histories of various distilleries, understanding the intracacies of production processes and training their palates to savour complex flavour profiles. And at the other extreme, some people subscribe to the point of view that 'wine is fine but liquor's quicker'.The latter type seems to be pretty rare in Asia, where people mostly prefer drinks that are meant to be measured out by finger-widths. According to a Forbes article published just last week, at a recent Sotheby's auction of whiskey and rare spirits, 80% of the buyers were Asian (and 60% were under the age of 40). It's normal, at least in the opinion of one Sotheby's spokesperson, for people to open bottles that cost more than $50,000 on an average evening at home. And in June, according to the same report, Sotheby's sold 24 bottles of China's popular Kweichow Moutai liquor for a record $1.4 million.While most people aren't making such extravagant purchases, this report about Asia's most popular spirits brands underscores the regional preference for drinks one sips and considers\u2014rather than mixes into cocktails. On the lists that follow, you'll find precious few vodkas, rums, gins or tequilas. In Asia, it's all about the cognacs, whiskys and bourbons (although in China, it's also about the baijiu).The following facts about Asia's favourite spirits/liquor brands are derived from the 2021 edition of Campaign Asia-Pacific's exclusive Asia's Top 1000 Brands research, done in partnership with Nielsen IQ. The region's most comprehensive research on consumer brand perception, Asia's Top 1000 Brands asks consumers in 14 Asia-Pacific markets to name the brands they consider the best in 15 major product and service categories. From this, we compile the overall Asia's Top 1000 Brands ranking, a list of the top 100 brands in each market, and a variety of features and category-based reports like this one.Without further ado...ASIA'S TOP 10 SPIRITS/LIQUOR BRANDSBrand 2021 2020 Johnnie Walker 1 1 Chivas 2 2 Hennessy 3 3 Jack Daniel's 4 4 Kweichow Moutai* 5 15 Remy Martin 6 6 Wuliangye* 7 21 Suntory 8 12 Martell 9 8 Ballantine's 10 7 * These Chinese brands benefitted from a methodology change this year, which gave more weight than before to the input of respondents in China.DRINK IN THESE DATA POINTSEnjoy more shots of knowledge about Asia's favourite liquor brands, across the region and in specific markets.Specific markets where Johnnie Walker walks in front of the pack:AustraliaSingaporeMalaysiaTaiwanThailandOther market-specific No. 1 brands:Asahi (Japan)Ballantine's (Korea)Chivas (Indonesia and Vietnam)Hennessy (Hong Kong)Jim Beam (New Zealand)Kweichow Moutai (China)Royal Stag (India)San Miguel (Philippines)Market-specific No. 2 brands:Chivas (Hong Kong, Thailand)Hennessy (Malaysia, Taiwan, Vietnam)Jack Daniel's (Australia, Indonesia, New Zealand)Johnnie Walker (India, Korea, Philippines, New Zealand)Martell (Singapore)Sapporo (Japan)Wuliangye (China)Singular appeal - Brands that crack the top 10 in only one market:42 Below Vodka (No. 4 in New Zealand)Asahi (No. 1 in Japan)Bombay Sapphire (No. 6 in New Zealand)ChangYu (No. 8 in China)Crown Royal (No. 7 in Indonesia)GSM Blue (No. 6 in Philippines)Imperial blue (No. 7 in India)Jian Nan Chun (No. 9 in China)Jinro / Chamisul (No. 3 in Korea)Kinmen Kao Liang (No. 3 in Taiwan)Luzhou Lao Jiao (No. 6 in China)Mekhong (No. 10 in Thailand)Meridian (No. 6 in Taiwan)Monkey Shoulder (No. 10 in Taiwan)Kweichow Moutai (No. 1 in China)National Cellar 1573 (No. 4 in China)Nikka (No. 9 in Vietnam)Novellino (No. 5 in Philippines)Old Monk (No. 3 in India)Regency (No. 5 in Thailand)Royal Challenge (No. 4 in India)Royal Stag (No. 1 in India)San Miguel (No. 1 in Philippines)SangSom (No. 5 in Thailand)Sapporo (No. 2 in Japan)Tanduay (No. 8 in Philippines)Wuliangye (No. 2 in China)Brands 11-20 across the region (alphabetical order):AbsolutAsahiBacardiJim BeamThe MacallanMcDowell\u2019sMoet & ChandonRed HorseSmirnoffYamazakiBottom's up!",

Picture: Nelson Ching \u2014 Bloomberg\u201cI was a little bit worried because he did go up in the barriers in his last start and I really couldn\u2019t risk him falling into his old ways again so we thought it was safer to bring him back to the farm.\u201cIt is frustrating because we know he has ability and we spent so many months trying to get him into the barriers and has hasn\u2019t had that race experience on his side.\u201dAfter putting in arguably the run of the race in the San Domenico from a wide barrier, Fogden says Maotai finally has a draw which will allow him to put his best foot forward in the Listed Heritage Stakes (1100m), which was won by the legendary Lonhro in 2001.\u201cI wanted to wait for the right race and we secured Tim Clark for it a long way out so I thought this one stacked up for this horse,\u201d Fogden said.\u201cHe\u2019s in tip-top shape, he has drawn a lot better this time than he has in his last two runs down there where we got the visitors draw.Maotai, trained by Kacy Fogden cruises to victory. Picture: Grant Peters \u2014 Trackside Photography.\u201cHe is a magnificent traveller, the trips don\u2019t bother him at all so he was back in his old routine and went down (on Wednesday night) and arrived in the morning and is all normal again.\u201cHe has gone down there and is racing with the best of the best but he is so inexperienced so it is what it is with him.\u201dIt marks the start of an exciting few months for Fogden who has a team of two-year-old\u2019s ready to hit the ground running after putting in big trial performances in Sydney and Brisbane.Carrying the prominent Aquis colours, Fogden is hoping to have a presence in the early two-year-old races, especially in the Group 3 Breeders\u2019 Plate at Randwick next week.",

            "description": "People wearing face masks are seen at a main shopping area almost a year after the global outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, Hubei province, China December 6, 2020. Picture taken December 6, 2020. REUTERS/Aly Song Acquire Licensing RightsHONG KONG, Sept 7 (Reuters Breakingviews) - President Xi Jinping is muffling China\u2019s consumer boom. Policies targeting spending excesses are hammering listed companies from e-commerce giant Alibaba (9988.HK) to liquor specialist Kweichow Moutai (600519.SS). Elsewhere officials are moving to buttress trade surpluses and state industrial giants. Companies who had bet that Chinese shoppers would evolve into free-spending Americans will be worried; trade partners should be alarmed.China may be a major contributor to global GDP growth, but that is largely a statistical by-product of weighted averages. The country\u2019s gross savings rate, at 44% of national income in 2019, is one of the highest in the world; household consumption\u2019s share of national output is nearly twenty percentage points below the global average, per World Bank data. For decades its state-driven investment model captured earnings from Chinese workers and lent them to strategic industries at low rates via government-owned banks. Useful in earlier phases of development, the approach has engendered vast industrial and financial overcapacity, which the economy must shovel into overseas markets somehow.Rainy day fund: Chinese household consumption's share of GDP is one of the lowest in the world Acquire Licensing RightsThere is nothing wrong with trade surpluses. Yet the means by which China slowly took over 15% of the global export market \u2013 a share no country has enjoyed since the 1970\u2019s - entailed heavy financial repression and protectionism, sloppy lending and weak environmental and labour protections. It also depended on people in other countries, particularly the United States, buying more, borrowing more, and saving less than they should. The U.S. mortgage crisis in 2008, for example, was facilitated more than somewhat by China lending the fruits of its workforce productivity to Americans at dirt-cheap rates by purchasing Treasury bonds.Government media does talk about the need to \u201cspur consumption\u201d, which foreign brands and governments seeking to sell into the country\u2019s vast internal market love to hear. Beijing does want to enlarge its middle class. But that won\u2019t be easy or quick. In the meantime austerity remains a bureaucratic reflex.Rising household debt, for example, may have caused officials to turn against spending on condos, pricey booze, video games and more, plus harshly pull back fintech giants like Ant for issuing easy consumer loans. In July the government shut down the for-profit tutoring industry, wrecking a swathe of listed companies on the theory that excessive education fees are deterring couples from reproducing. For similar reasons officials plan to reduce \u201cunreasonable incomes\u201d and reduce tax evasion by the wealthy. They are forcibly holding down home values in some cities via raw price controls.On paper these are quick ways to increase disposable incomes without forcing employers to hike wages. But the initial effect is negative for consumption and also employment; the private education sector employed millions. Jittery investors are therefore reconsidering once-hot consumer plays. China\u2019s benchmark CSI300 index is the world\u2019s worst performing by far this year, down 5%. The Fidelity China Consumer Fund has shed 30% since February, per Refinitiv data.EXPORTS UBER ALLESChen Li, an economist at local brokerage Soochow Securities, made waves on Chinese social media in August by arguing the country should aspire to a German-style development template, not an American one. A more Germanic China might have a thicker social safety net, a lot less home ownership, and better vocational training. But it would also reinforce the already-powerful manufacturing sector, and goose overseas investment. Germany runs a current account surplus equal to 7% of output, nearly four times higher than China\u2019s. Should the People\u2019s Republic successfully duplicate Berlin\u2019s approach in an economy four times Germany\u2019s size, it could further imbalance a world economy already over-dependent on American demand to absorb excess production \u2013 and on the American dollar.Xi\u2019s new \u201cdual circulation\u201d strategy looks like an attempt to have it both ways. The president wants Chinese shoppers to have more buying power but to spend locally, which will hedge domestic firms against trade wars. Yet he also wants a powerful export sector, which proved a good hedge against the pandemic shock. This mix would push up the trade surplus and in fact looks like a modified version of the credit-intensive factory economy the Communist Party knows how to run, as opposed to one dominated by uppity internet service giants.Trade partners must also factor in the possibility that Xi\u2019s push will only be half-successful, boosting exports without substantially increasing domestic demand or easing inequality. Forcibly restraining the property market, where most ordinary people park their investable wealth, could easily backfire, for example.If it were politically easy to redistribute assets and upgrade safety nets, Beijing would have already done so. This is the same country that systematically underfunded its own pensions for years, which only encouraged household frugality. Even at the peak of the pandemic, officials resisted cash handouts to households; it\u2019s notable that retail has lagged the rest of China\u2019s economic recovery. The world already has one Germany. That\u2019s more than enough.The Great Inversion: Private consumption's share of Chinese GDP fallen for decades Acquire Licensing RightsFollow @petesweeneypro on TwitterCONTEXT NEWS- Activity in China's services sector contracted in August from the previous month, the private Caixin survey showed on Sept. 3. Monthly manufacturing activity also contracted for the first time in 16 months.Imports in July rose 28.1% from a year earlier, lagging a Reuters poll forecast of 33%. That compares to the 36.7% annual growth the previous month. The latest Reuters poll published Sept. 6 showed analysts expect import growth to continue decelerating in August.- The central government has launched a massive campaign targeting wide swathes of the country\u2019s consumer-facing companies, with state media attacking industries including after-school tutoring, video games, liquor, and electronic cigarettes. The real estate sector has also come under heavy regulatory pressure to cool prices.Editing by Robyn Mak and Katrina HamlinOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Opinions expressed are those of the author.

            "description": "NewsBy db_staffBoth Pernod Ricard and Brown Forman beat analysts\u2019 estimates when they announced results last week.For the 12 months to the end of June the French group achieved organic growth of 18.3% and very strong organic operating margin expansion of 213 basis points.For its part Brown-Forman posted sales growth of 20% for the first three months of its financial year.These strong figures need to be viewed against those for the same period last year when the coronavirus pandemic created havoc but both companies were justifiably pleased with their performances.For Brown-Forman the most significant improvement was Jack Daniel\u2019s Tennessee Whiskey returning to growth with underlying net sales 21% ahead, or 6% on a two-year average. As a predominantly on-trade brand Jack Daniels suffered disproportionately during the lockdowns.Lawson Whiting, Brown-Forman\u2019s president and chief executive officer said his company\u2019s results \u201cwere driven by the strength of our portfolio, which benefited from the re-opening of the on-premise, sustained at-home consumption, and continued premiumization trends.\u201dHe also predicted that the growth in US home consumption caused by the pandemic would not reverse.In Paris Alexandre Ricard, Pernod Ricard\u2019s chairman and CEO said: \u201cThe business rebounded very strongly during FY21 to exceed FY19 levels. We expect this good sales momentum to continue in FY22 with, in particular, a very dynamic Q1.\u201d However, he declined to put a figure on that prediction.He said \u201cSales grew in all regions with growth in the Americas up 14% with the combined growth of the USA, Canada and South America offsetting sales declines across travel retail.Notably Pernod Ricard\u2019s net sales for the year in China topped the $1 billion mark for the first time, rising by 44%. Annual sales in the US topped $2bn, another record despite the pandemic.\u201cThanks to our solid fundamentals, our teams and our brand portfolio, we are emerging from this crisis stronger,\u201d Ricard said and went on to suggest that the French group will generate organic growth of up to about 7% a year.Lawson said that Brown-Forman anticipates mid-single digit growth in underlying net sales and operating income for the full-year 2022.So what is next? The French group has brought its dividend back up to the level paid in 2019 and is to recommence its \u20ac500m share buyback programme to enhance value to shareholders. And Ricard himself reiterated his ambition to become \u201cthe Number One wine and spirits company in the world\u201d.That is a tall order given that the French group is valued at \u00a341bn, just under half Diageo\u2019s market capitalisation and less than an eighth of the world\u2019s biggest alcohol group, baijiu producer Kweichow Moutai.Ricard said much of his future growth would come from continuing his Transform and Accelerate programme which includes further premiumisation and leveraging data to cater for consumer preferences. He pointed out that Pernod Ricard\u2019s e-commerce activities grew by 63% in the latest year but still account for less than 5% of overall sales.Ecommerce is an area of weakness for Brown Forman, where it accounts for about 2% of sales, reflecting its previous focus on the on trade. Its hopes its recent collaboration pact with brewer Pabst will improve its performance in the take-home market.Ricard also confirmed that he would continue to seek further beneficial niche acquisitions and range extensions.In addition, growing consumer focus on sustainability and conservation would also drive future growth.Even Beijing\u2019s veiled warnings about a new crackdown on ostentation and expensive consumption he saw as a possible benefit. There would be opportunities he said to \u201csupport middle class households\u201d even if the government cracked down on billionaires.Brown-Forman was less bullish, warning that short-term supply chain problems concerning glass and higher agave input costs. These caused gross margin to contract by 70 basis points to 61% in the latest quarter.Because of these problems it has revised expectations for the full year and now expects gross margin to be flat, or even slightly lower but becoming \u201cless significant\u201d in the new year.A big fillip would come from the lifting of European tariffs on bourbon in retaliation for US penalties on steel and aluminium from the EU and UK.Whiting said: \u201cWe remain cautiously optimistic that the U.S. can reach a resolution on the underlying trade disputes with the UK and EU by the end of the year, which would result in the removal of tariffs on American whiskey. While we\u2019ve been hopeful for some time about this, we believe there continues to be reason for this optimism.\u201cThe EU and the U.S. have publicly stated their commitment to this timeline. And moreover, the UK is conducting a review of its retaliatory tariffs, which we hope will highlight that American whiskey bears a disproportionate share of this overall tariff burden.\u201dOne analyst calculates that the lifting of tariff penalties would add 200 basis points to Brown Forman\u2019s margins.",

La produzione di questo alcoolico, la cui gradazione pu\u00f2 variare in un range tra il 35% e il 60%, \u00e8 localizzata nella parte centrale del paese, nelle province di Sichuan e Guizhou, dove hanno sede i produttori pi\u00f9 importanti e rinomati. La sua enorme popolarit\u00e0 \u00e8 diffusa in tutta la Cina: \u00e8 possibile trovare una bottiglia di baijiu pressoch\u00e9 ad ogni evento e celebrazione in Cina, dai ricevimenti nuziali agli incontri sociali. Il baijiu \u00e8 parte essenziale della cultura imprenditoriale cinese ed \u00e8 servito nelle cene d\u2019affari, al fine di onorare i commensali e dimostrare rispetto e amicizia. Inoltre, il baijiu di fascia alta rappresenta un prestigioso regalo, offerto anche ai politici stranieri; il baijiu \u00e8 stato utilizzato per brindare durante eventi diplomatici ufficiali, come la storica visita del 1972 del Presidente degli Stati Uniti Nixon a Pechino.La produzione e il consumo di questo distillato a base di cereali, ottenuto da sorgo, grano, riso, mais e fermentato utilizzando un agente fermentante denominato \u201cqu\u201d, risale a pi\u00f9 di mille anni ed \u00e8 la bevanda alcolica pi\u00f9 consumata in Cina. Secondo gli ultimi dati diffusi da China Alcoholic Drinks Association (CADA), le vendite di baijiu hanno rappresentato il 70% dei ricavi totali dei produttori cinesi di bevande alcoliche nel 2020, in un mercato che include produttori di birra e vino.Il fatturato totale del settore ha raggiunto i 584 miliardi di renminbi nel 2020, in crescita rispetto ai 562 miliardi registrati nel 2019. Il numero di produttori \u00e8 diminuito dai 1.600 nel 2017 ai 1.040 operanti nel 2020, a causa del crescente consolidamento e concentrazione di mercato. Di questi, 19 sono societ\u00e0 quotate in borsa, a Shanghai e Shenzhen, e insieme rappresentano il 41% del mercato.I principali produttori sono Kweichow Moutai, che controlla il 17% del mercato, Wuliangye (10% di quota di mercato), Yanghe (4%) e Luzhou Laojiao (3%) e sono principalmente focalizzati nella distillazione di baijiu di fascia alta.Kweichow Moutai produce le bottiglie di baijiu piu prestigiose e apprezzate, con 95 miliardi di renminbi di fatturato (su un totale di 98 miliardi) derivanti dalle vendite del liquore. Fondata a Zunyi, nella provincia di Guizhou, Moutai \u00e8 anche una delle aziende di maggior valore a livello mondiale, con una capitalizzazione di mercato di oltre 2.600 miliardi di renminbi (circa 400 miliardi di dollari), superiore rispetto ai ben piu noti Coca Cola, Pepsi e Diageo. Moutai \u00e8 un marchio molto ricercato e le sue bottiglie baijiu di fascia alta sono considerate uno status symbol per il loro prezzo elevato, che supera facilmente i 300 dollari.Wuliangye, con sede a Yibin, nella provincia del Sichuan, \u00e8 il secondo maggiore produttore cinese e si concentra principalmente sui baijiu dall\u2019aroma forte. Le vendite del liquore hanno generato oltre 44 miliardi di renminbi nel 2020, e il valore di mercato del gruppo ha superato i 1.160 miliardi di RMB (circa 170 miliardi di dollari).Altri grandi operatori del settore con ricavi generati da vendite di baijiu superiori ai 10 miliardi di renminbi includono Jiangsu Yanghe (e il suo brand Mengzhilan), Luzhou Laojiao, Shanxi Fenjiu, Beijing Shunxin (Niulanshan) e Anhui Gujing. Oltre ai produttori pi\u00f9 importanti, vengono apprezzati dai consumatori etichette piu di nicchia, come lo Shuijingfang, il Laobaigan, il Gongjiu, e baijiu di fascia piu bassa come il Red Star Erguotou.Il mercato oggigiorno richiede ai produttori di baijiu la capacit\u00e0 di innovare e migliorare costantemente la tecnologia di produzione e di prestare maggiore attenzione ai nuovi consumatori, in Cina e all\u2019estero: attualmente, il principale gruppo di consumatori del baijiu ha infatti pi\u00f9 di 60 anni, mentre i consumatori cinesi pi\u00f9 giovani mostrano meno affetto per il \u201cliquore bianco\u201d, preferendo altre bevande alcoliche, come whisky e liquori \u201coccidentali\u201d.Il baijiu sta diventando sempre pi\u00f9 conosciuto anche fuori dal suo paese d\u2019origine, con un numero crescente di consumatori stranieri che iniziano ad apprezzarne il sapore intenso. Il World Baijiu Day, viene celebrato ogni nono giorno del mese di agosto (da 8 \u201cba\u201d e 9 \u201cjiu\u201d, la cui pronuncia \u00e8 simile a quella di baijiu), al fine di promuovere il liquore cinese oltre i confini di Pechino ed e\u2019 stato promosso anche da Veronafiere in Cina insieme a Vinitaly e alla fiera Wine to Asia dedicata a settore wine and spirits.Di Lorenzo Riccardi*[Pubblicato su Italia Oggi]**Lorenzo Riccardi insegna presso la Shanghai Jiaotong University ed \u00e8 managing partner di RsA Asia (rsa-tax.com).

Instead, it tracks PwC\u2019s Global Top 100 Companies by market capitalization on perception strength rather than financial strength.It finds that companies providing luxury goods or online shopping have been positively impacted by the pandemic, as consumer priorities and access shifted as a result of lockdowns.The report said LVMH in particular has benefited from the events of the last 12 months, as it jumped 37 places from 66th to 29th in this year\u2019s perception report. Online shopping giants Amazon and Alibaba also experienced a boost, rising 13 and 12 places, respectively.Companies associated most strongly with a brick-and-mortar offering have suffered over the last 12 months, with the likes of Walmart Inc. and McDonald\u2019s falling sharply down the index ranking.At the same time, data shows that business-to-business companies have become household names. Tech and Pharma companies, which were seen lower down the 2020 list, such as ASML and Danaher, have surged forward as behind-the-scenes as society focuses on the innovation that will help the world come out of the pandemic.Top 10 brands in the FutureBrand Index 2021. CourtesyJon Tipple, global chief strategy officer at FutureBrand, said this year\u2019s research has revealed \u201ca huge shift in the way companies work and how they convey their mission to their consumers.\u201d\u201cThose that look set to thrive in a post-pandemic world are companies prioritizing innovation to consistently impact individual well-being and drive change for good at scale\u2026.Consumers are also looking for the \u2018feel good\u2019 factor; in a period of 12 months when so much has been taken away from us, luxury brands like Apple and LVMH have done particularly well,\u201d he added.The top ten brands in the index are ASML Holdings, Apple, Prosus NV, Danaher Corp, NextEra Energy, TSMC, Kweichow Moutai, Ping an Insurance, Reliance Industries and Microsoft.",

            "description": "The new wind of egalitarianism sweeping China was never going to work out well for Kweichow Moutai, makers of a fiery liquor. The problem was not just that boozy business banquets were officially branded as \u201cdisgusting\u201d or that one case of corruption involved an official who had taken 4,000 bottles of the liquor in bribes.A deeper issue is that the company finds itself on the wrong side of China\u2019s latest great social endeavour. Having spent four decades creating one of the most unequal societies on Earth, Beijing is now seized by a mantra of \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d \u2014 or redistributing spoils to hundreds of millions of have-nots.Moutai, which is drunk in shot glasses and can cost thousands of dollars a bottle, has been a pungent symbol of China\u2019s \u201cgilded age\u201d. Toasts of the liquor have helped cement the cosy symbiosis between elite dealmakers and government officials, generating fabulous riches for a charmed few.So a recent sharp reversal in Kweichow Moutai\u2019s fortunes may signal the size of the social engineering project that President Xi Jinping has in mind. The market capitalisation of the world\u2019s most highly valued drinks company has shrunk by $207bn since a peak in early February \u2014 more than the value of Japan\u2019s Suntory and Heineken of the Netherlands combined.\u201cThere is a sea-change in the way the Chinese Communist party sees its legitimacy,\u201d said Yu Jie, a researcher at Chatham House, a London-based think-tank. \u201cXi is addressing ordinary peoples\u2019 agonies over unequal distribution of income and the lack of equal access to basic social welfare and some services.\u201dA commission led by Xi issued a call to arms this week. It said China would \u201cregulate excessively high incomes and encourage high-income groups and enterprises to return more to society\u201d. While the party had long allowed some people and regions to \u201cget rich first\u201d, it was now prioritising \u201ccommon prosperity for all\u201d.At stake is the CCP\u2019s social contract with China\u2019s people, Yu said. \u201cIf the party defends the current status quo that is manifestly unfair in its distribution of wealth and opportunity, trust from ordinary people will collapse.\u201dBut the task before Beijing is huge. The number of Chinese billionaires reached 1,058 last year, exceeding the 696 in the US, according to the Hurun Global Rich List. Yet some 600m Chinese live off a monthly income of about Rmb1,000 ($154).Details on how and at what pace China plans to address such inequalities are sketchy or non-existent. But it is clear that several of China\u2019s wealthiest private entrepreneurs are in the crosshairs. Tens of billions of dollars have been wiped from the wealth of tycoons such as Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, and Pony Ma, founder of Tencent, as new regulations have depressed their companies\u2019 share prices.The response of some savvy entrepreneurs has been to swing behind Beijing\u2019s agenda. Wang Xing, founder of the food-delivery group Meituan, donated $2.3bn to a philanthropic fund that supports education and science. Tencent announced a $7.7bn fund dedicated to \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d, which it defined as boosting the income of low-income groups, healthcare coverage, rural economic development and education for less advantaged students. \u201cAs a Chinese tech company blessed by China\u2019s reform and opening up, Tencent has always been thinking how to help social development with its own technologies and digital power,\u201d the company said.Other potential measures to close China\u2019s wealth gap could include significant changes to the tax code. The lenient tax treatment of technology companies could be fully or partially withdrawn, obliging them to pay closer to the national corporate tax rate of 25 per cent, analysts said. Another measure under consideration is the implementation of a property sales tax.But whatever detailed measures are adopted, the general policy direction is set firm. This is because of the particular manner in which the party signals and choreographs its rule.At the 19th CCP Congress in 2017, Xi announced a change in the party\u2019s \u201cprincipal contradiction\u201d \u2014 the philosophy that guides all its endeavours. The previous philosophy, set in 1981, emphasised acceleration of economic growth. Since 2017, the party has put the focus on reducing inequalities that threaten to undermine its legitimacy and improving the quality of people\u2019s lives.It has taken Xi four years to swing the full force of his administration behind the new policy direction, but he now appears determined, according to Chinese analysts. At the party\u2019s 20th Congress to be held next year, he must show progress towards its newly defined objective.Overall, though, the clearest way to understand what is happening in China is to compare it to 19th-century US history, said Yuen Yuen Ang, an associate professor at the University of Michigan.The Gilded Age, which ran from roughly 1870 to 1900, was a time of rapid growth and gross inequality as millions of poor immigrants arrived in the US and wealth became concentrated in the hands of powerful industrialists. That period gave way to the Progressive Era, a time of extensive social and political reform. \u201cXi Jinping is attempting to summon China\u2019s own progressive era,\u201d said Ang.james.kynge@ft.com",

Nelson Ching | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBEIJING \u2014 Kweichow Moutai and other Chinese liquor stocks fell Thursday, on track for five-day losses in the wake of reported new regulation on the industry. The reports come as the central Chinese government has issued a raft of new announcements in recent months, some catching investors by surprise. For example, authorities ordered app stores to remove Chinese ride-hailing app Didi , just days after its massive IPO in the U.S. Shares have fallen 41% since. Underlying Beijing's rush of actions \u2014 to tackle monopolistic practices among tech companies, increase data security and prevent \"disorderly expansion of capital,\" among others \u2014 is a theme of \"common prosperity.\" The vague term has emerged in political speeches as a slogan for supporting moderate wealth for all, rather than just a few.watch nowIn the traditional Chinese \"baijiu\" liquor industry, high-end brand Kweichow Moutai is the most expensive stock traded on the mainland A share market. Moutai is preferred by many Chinese for sealing deals at business dinners, where social drinking is ingrained. On Thursday, state-owned Securities Times reported, citing trade publications, that market leader Moutai is trying to stabilize prices for its products ahead of the major holidays in the next two months and the price for a bottle had fallen by as much as 300 yuan ($46.40) in the last day. Chinese media reported Thursday afternoon that Kweichow Moutai said it did not change price guidelines. Prices for Moutai bottles have soared along with the company's share price, to about the equivalent of a few hundred U.S. dollars. In June, a crate of Moutai from 1974 even sold for 1 million pounds ($1.37 million) at a Sotheby's auction. Moutai shares fell more than 4% Thursday, bringing five-day losses to more than 1.5%. Baijiu stocks had climbed earlier this week ahead of Thursday's losses. Other major baijiu manufacturers like Wuliangye and Luzhou Laojiao fell more than 4% each, on track for sharper losses over the last five trading days.",

            "description": "0 shares ShareTweetPinLinkedInRecent Research from Approve Predicts Tesla and Tencent will Join the $1 Trillion Club in 2022.At the time of publication, only five companies could claim a trillion-dollar valuation: Apple, Microsoft, Saudi Aramco, Amazon, and Alphabet (Google). Since publication, Facebook has also reached the trillion-dollar mark. Only one company boasts a $2 trillion valuation: Apple, who hit the mark in August 2020, merely two years after achieving $1 trillion valuation.China-based Tencent had a turbulent year with market highs in February hitting $916bn, but its high average annual growth rate of 97.04% is what keeps it set to hit the $1 trillion mark in 2022. Tesla is also joint first to reach $1 trillion by next year with a 123.87% average annual growth rate.Chinese tech conglomerate holding company Tencent boasts a market valuation of around $740 billion in June 2021 and very fast growth, growing by just under double each year over the past decade. Tencent was on the verge of a $1 trillion valuation in February this year, reaching $916 billion, before tumbling back to $740 billion.Tesla has quickly established itself as the world\u2019s most valuable carmaker, ahead of industry giants which have been around for generations. While Tesla\u2019s market value is still some way off $1 trillion at $584 billion, an annual growth rate of 123.87% means that Elon Musk\u2019s disruptive EV company are on track to hit a trillion-dollar valuation fairly soon. However, like Tencent, it has seen its market cap drop off slightly in recent months.Across the fifty most valuable publicly traded companies across the world as of 9th June 2021, the average year estimate to reach $1 trillion was 2043. The companies that are set to reach by $1 trillion valuation by 2023 are Comcast, and Meituan. By 2024, Netflix, Nvidia and Kweichow Moutai are all set to reach this mark.The sectors that are growing the fastest are outlined in this research: telecommunications with 65.85% average annual growth rate, automotive at 65.49%, entertainment at 43.91%, and technology at 33.65%.Our constant need for connection has resulted in companies such as Comcast accelerating growth in the telecommunications industry. Entertainment is equally as important to the modern consumer, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, so companies including Netflix and Disney have seen increasing market caps. While at the forefront of tech innovation, Tesla is also bringing the automotive industry to the top of the charts.You can view the full research at: https://www.approve.com/tracking-trillion-dollar-valuations/",

            "description": "Alors que la Chine serre la vis dans les principaux secteurs de son \u00e9conomie, les groupes de spiritueux pourraient \u00eatre la prochaine cible. L'Administration d'\u00c9tat chinoise pour la r\u00e9gulation du march\u00e9 (SAMR) se r\u00e9unit ce vendredi pour discuter de la r\u00e9glementation du march\u00e9 des alcools, selon la presse officielle, ce qui inqui\u00e8te particuli\u00e8rement les investisseurs.L'ordre du jour pourrait \u00eatre le prix du baijiu, une eau-de-vie \u00e0 base de c\u00e9r\u00e9ales tr\u00e8s populaire en Chine, selon les analystes de Jefferies. \"Nous pensons que le prix actuel du march\u00e9 des produits baijiu et le potentiel d'une nouvelle hausse des prix dans l'industrie ont attir\u00e9 l'attention du gouvernement, qui va donc probablement mettre en \u0153uvre des mesures pour stabiliser le prix du march\u00e9\", indiquent-ils dans une note.R\u00e9sultat, le groupe Kweichow Moutai, l'une des plus importantes valeurs en Asie et sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 dans cet alcool, a recul\u00e9 de 4,44% \u00e0 la Bourse de Shanghai, terminant la s\u00e9ance au plus bas depuis plus d'un an \u00e0 1548 CNY (renminbi), soit 204,09 euros. Plus globalement, l'indice sectoriel chinois des spiritueux a chut\u00e9 de 6,94%, au plus bas depuis mars.Un impact qui pourrait \u00eatre mondialMais la volont\u00e9 de la Chine de reprendre en main des pans importants de son \u00e9conomie pourrait aussi affecter des g\u00e9ants fran\u00e7ais de spiritueux. La Chine est en effet l'un des trois premiers march\u00e9s du groupe Pernod Ricard avec les Etats-Unis et l'Inde. Chivas Regal, Martell et Royal Salute ont \u00e9t\u00e9 introduites dans le pays il y a plus de deux d\u00e9cennies, et depuis lors, elles sont devenues le premier portefeuille de spiritueux import\u00e9s de Chine, peut-on lire sur le site Pernod Ricard China.Le num\u00e9ro deux mondial des vins et spiritueux a d'ailleurs chut\u00e9 de 1,49% \u00e0 la Bourse de Paris, tandis que Remy Cointreau perdait 1,90%. Le groupe fran\u00e7ais de spiritueux a d'ailleurs boost\u00e9 ses ventes au troisi\u00e8me trimestre l'an dernier notamment gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l'acc\u00e9l\u00e9ration des ventes en Chine.De plus, il y a quelques mois, R\u00e9my Cointreau Chine se r\u00e9jouissait de l'\u00e9tablissement de la zone de libre \u00e9change du port de Hainan. La filiale du groupe a d'ailleurs pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au mois de mai les marques de son portefeuille de spiritueux d'exception \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re China International Consumer Products Expo, preuve du dynamisme du groupe dans le pays.Mais l'industrie des spiritueux n'est pas la premi\u00e8re vis\u00e9e par cette mise au pas voulue par P\u00e9kin. La Tech, l'\u00e9ducation, la sant\u00e9, les services financiers ou encore les transports sont \u00e9galement dans le viseur du gouvernement chinois. Depuis novembre dernier d\u00e9j\u00e0, le pouvoir chinois a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de reprendre directement en main plusieurs soci\u00e9t\u00e9s cot\u00e9es \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger. Il accuse leurs dirigeants d'avoir pris trop de libert\u00e9s et parfois de manquer de prudence dans la gestion des donn\u00e9es personnelles. Le gouvernement, qui veut renforcer son contr\u00f4le sur l'\u00e9conomie et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, a adopt\u00e9 des r\u00e8gles anti-monopoles ou relatives \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des donn\u00e9es.De plus, dans un document pr\u00e9sentant ses grandes orientations jusqu'en 2025, le gouvernement a en effet appel\u00e9 le 11 ao\u00fbt \u00e0 \"renforcer l'application de la loi dans des domaines cl\u00e9s\" de l'\u00e9conomie. Cette intervention unilat\u00e9rale du pouvoir sur ces march\u00e9s n'a donc pas fini d'inqui\u00e9ter les investisseurs, notamment \u00e9trangers.Lire aussi 4 mnApr\u00e8s la Tech et l'\u00e9ducation, P\u00e9kin veut \"renforcer la loi\" dans d'autres secteurs cl\u00e9s",

            "description": "China\u2019s quest for office sobriety is not going down smoothly for Kweichow Moutai, the Chinese liquor giant and the world\u2019s largest liquor company by market capitalization.The stock price for Kweichow Moutai has fallen nearly 10% since last Tuesday when China\u2019s top anti-corruption watchdog, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), criticized drinking behaviors in Chinese offices.The CCDI issued the statement on Aug. 10 in response to online furor regarding an account of a rape case at Chinese tech giant Alibaba. In the incident, a female employee at Alibaba reported that her boss, Wang Chengwen, forced her to go on a business trip in late July, pressured her to drink to the point where she blacked out, and then raped her, the employee wrote on an internal company message board.The employee\u2019s account went viral on Chinese social media, prompting Alibaba to fire the employee. (In an initial probe, local authorities in China\u2019s eastern city of Jinan described the case as \u201cforcible indecency\u201d and not rape, but their investigation is still ongoing.)But the case sparked a broader backlash to drinking culture at Chinese companies.In a note to his employees, Alibaba chief executive Daniel Zhang vowed to rectify an \u201cugly forced drinking culture\u201d that was plaguing the company. In the Aug. 10 statement, the CCDI said that it would strengthen oversight of Chinese companies to combat toxic work cultures in which employees are pressured to drink.But if and how regulators will do that remains unclear. Pressuring others to drink is a behavior that is deeply entrenched in China\u2019s business culture. It is seen by many as essential to striking deals, hosting banquets, or even conducting a job interview.\u201cThe million dollar question is, does this mean there\u2019s going to be a lot of regulation that will follow [the CCDI statement]\u2026 Or is this problem with irresponsible drinking something [that China will] address over time,\u201d says Euan McLeish, a managing director and senior equity analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in Hong Kong. McLeish explained that potential regulatory measures could include increased taxes on alcohol, education campaigns to limit drinking, and giving more power to servers to cut off drunk customers. \u201c[This uncertainty] is why the liquor market is pretty jumpy at the moment.\u201dThe share price for Kweichow Moutai competitor Wuliangye is similarly down nearly 8% since the CCDI announcement.Kweichow Moutai is known for its expensive baijiu, a clear, strong liquor that is often distilled using sorghum or other grains and was famously a drink of choice for China\u2019s founder Mao Zedong. Kweichow Moutai\u2019s elite status has made it a symbol of wealth and power as well as a mainstay at business banquets across the country.\u201cIt\u2019s not something that a business would serve day-to-day,\u201d says McLeish. \u201cBut it still is consumed very much on business occasions, when [businesses] are celebrating or there\u2019s someone they are trying to impress.\u201dKweichow Moutai\u2019s popularity has made it one of China\u2019s largest companies with a market capitalization of over $313 billion, nearly three times the size of Belgian alcohol giant Anheuser-Busch InBev, and powerful enough to help prop up the finances and fund public infrastructure of Guizhou province, the underdeveloped province in southern China where Kweichow Moutai is headquartered.Moutai\u2019s size and status within China may make the company relatively immune to the CCDI\u2019s warning about drinking culture. The company withstood a regulatory crackdown once before, notes McLeish. In the early 2010s, Chinese President Xi Jinping launched an anti-corruption campaign that targeted the lavish spending habits of public officials.But Brock Silvers, chief investment officer at Kaiyuan Capital in Hong Kong, says that Beijing\u2019s latest campaign against drinking culture could spell trouble for Kweichow Moutai, given that Chinese authorities are currently cracking down on the power of many of the country\u2019s largest firms.\u201cIn this atmosphere, any regulatory attention will be taken seriously. China\u2019s recent crackdown on workplace alcohol culture is thus an important matter for [Kweichow Moutai],\u201d says Silvers. \u201cIt\u2019s likely to affect the company\u2019s bottom line and perhaps even scare investors sober.\u201d",

Una consuetudine che spesso porta i dirigenti a costringere i propri dipendenti a fare altrettanto, con conseguenze talvolta riprovevoli, finita adesso nel mirino del Governo, non nuovo a tagli radicali di pessime abitudini, con conseguenze, pi\u00f9 o meno dirette, anche sul vino.Nel 2012, ad esempio, la lotta alla corruzione mise un freno a qualsiasi tipo di regalo ai funzionari governativi sopra ad un valore economico pi\u00f9 simbolico che altro, provocando il crollo del mercato dei fine wine, all\u2019epoca basato essenzialmente sui vini di Bordeaux, che vissero, infatti, un vero e proprio crollo delle vendite sul mercato cinese. Questa volta, il conto dovrebbe essere salato soprattutto per i produttori di Baiju, il distillato di riso popolarissimo in Cina, come raccontano i cali in Borsa di brand come Kweichow Moutai e Wuliangye Yibin\u2019s.Anche il vino, come qualsiasi altro alcolico, specie di qualit\u00e0, rischia di pagare lo scotto di questa nuova lotta, culturale e sociale, contro gli eccessi. Il momento \u00e8, comunque, positivo, ma non ancora di definitivo superamento dell\u2019emergenza, come dimostra il nuovo rinvio di \u201cWine To Asia\u201d, la fiera enoica, firmata da Veronafiere e Vinitaly, insieme al partner cinese Pacco Communication, prevista in calendario dal 12 al 14 agosto, e riprogrammata, invece, a fine anno, dal 2 al 4 dicembre 2021, sempre a Shenzhen.Copyright \u00a9 2000/2023"

            "description": "China should reduce business drinking and replace it with \u201ccorrect values,\u201d the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s anti-corruption watchdog said in a commentary on a sexual assault case involving employees with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.Some \u201cunder the table rules\u201d such as forced drinking for business purposes may lead to crimes, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said in an article posted in the opinion section of its website under the name Shi Zhe. Those who violated laws in the Alibaba case will be punished strictly.Most alcohol-related stocks dropped in Wednesday\u2019s trading. The bellwether Kweichow Moutai Co. fell as much as 2.1%, while Wuliangye Yibin Co. \u2014 its next biggest peer by market value \u2014 dropped as much as 2.8%. Wine maker Shanxi Xinghuacun Fen Wine Factory Co. declined as much as 3.2%.China has moved in recent weeks to clamp down on a host of sectors seen as contributing to societal problems the Communist Party is seeking to fix, particularly ahead of a once-in-five-year party congress next year at which President Xi Jinping is expected to secure a third term. Investors have been dumping shares in any sector that receives criticism in state media, from digital gaming and e-cigarettes to property and baby formula.Alibaba this week fired a manager accused of rape, moving to contain the fallout after an employee\u2019s account of her ordeal went viral on social media and ignited fierce debate about rampant sexism across China\u2019s tech industry. The sexual assault allegations, first reported by the employee on Aug. 2, have unearthed systemic challenges with the company\u2019s mechanisms, Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang said in an internal memo seen by Bloomberg News.The incident involved an external client and several executives during a night of heavy drinking in the country\u2019s northeast. It highlighted pervasive mistreatment of female workers across companies in China, where the #MeToo movement has thus far failed to take off as widely as in Silicon Valley or elsewhere.The CCDI commentary highlighted pressure that employees face if they don\u2019t drink at company outings.\u2018Difficult to Resist\u2019\u201cIf you don\u2019t drink it, it\u2019s regarded as not giving face to the leader, ignoring the \u2018rules,\u2019\u201d it said. \u201cIn order to avoid encountering bullying and isolation, affecting future prospects, many people have to give in or get involved, and it is difficult to resist.\u201dChina\u2019s premium distillers have been closely following government rules to avoid attention from China\u2019s regulators, instead of pursuing ambitious growth. For example, it\u2019s been several years since Moutai raised the factory-gate price of its core baijiu product Feitian, which has stayed at 969 yuan ($150) a half-liter for three years. It also increased direct sales after regulators condemned distributors who would hoard stock and bid up the price.\u201cThe government has strict policies to require self discipline and strict obedience to laws for those gathering around a drinking table,\u201d said Peng Hong, head of Guangdong Liquor Association, in response to the watchdog\u2019s commentary. \u201cThis should be just an individual case and is not expected to have a significant impact on the industry as the market has a consensus that they should behave well when drinking otherwise they will be punished.\u201d",

            "description": "Investors wondering whether to put some of their hard-earned cash into the Chinese stock market are faced with a paradox: the country is too big and influential to ignore, but the market is too unpredictable for anything other than a bumpy ride.The past few days have illustrated the difficulties of investing in a country run by a political elite that tolerates a 'form of phoney capitalism'.An expected crackdown on online gaming, especially among the young Chinese, sent shares in Tencent \u2013 China's largest video games operator \u2013 into a tailspin.This followed in the wake of other crackdowns on China's technology sector. Last month, the Chinese government announced it would be barring tutoring for profit in core school subjects to ease financial pressures on families that have contributed to low birth rates.Too hot to handle?: It is difficult to invest in a country run by a political elite that tolerates a 'form of phoney capitalism'The news sent shockwaves through China's vast private education sector, hitting providers' share prices.The government also ordered app stores to remove Didi Chuxing's app, claiming the ride-hailing company had been illegally collecting users' personal data.This is after Didi, founded in China in 2012, had just listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The intervention sent Didi's shares plunging.'Scratch beneath the thin veneer and China is an illiberal, Marxist state where the priorities of the Communist Party will always ultimately take precedence and where political influence weighs heavily on companies,' says Jason Hollands, a director of wealth manager Tilney Smith & Williamson.'This makes the case for investing in China tricky on so many levels \u2013 morally as well as on investment grounds.'The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index has now lost more than 45 per cent of its value since February.So, does this represent a buying opportunity or, as Hollands suggests, should Chinese investments now be treated with extreme caution?Too big to ignore... the case for investing in China'If you haven't got any Chinese exposure in your investment portfolio, you probably need some,' says James Carthew, fund analyst at research company Quoted Data.Carthew believes there are bargains to pick up after the sharp market falls of recent weeks and months. 'China is too big to ignore,' he adds. 'Its economy continues to grow and its consumers are becoming more affluent.'Big name companies in China are increasingly household brands across the world.A record 143 of Fortune's top 500 global companies this year were Chinese, including the likes of online retailer JD.com, technology giant Alibaba, Tencent and electronics company Xiaomi.Given strong domestic consumption, Carthew believes all these companies have the ability to keep on growing and generating cash \u2013 despite the intimidatory actions of China's President Xi Jinping.Pruksa Iamthongthong is investment director of Asia Dragon, an investment trust run by funds giant Abrdn (previously known as Aberdeen Standard Investments). She is comfortable with the 39 per cent exposure that the \u00a3630million fund has in China.Among its top ten holdings are Alibaba, Tencent and drinks manufacturer Kweichow Moutai.She says: 'Despite the unsettling events of the past few weeks, we believe the private sector retains a critical role in ensuring that the Chinese economy continues to innovate and prosper \u2013 and that China reaches its goal of being a moderately prosperous nation by 2035.'She believes that despite the government's interference in certain business sectors, the Communist Party does not intend to make the stock market too risky for investors to have confidence in.She adds: 'A broad, heavy-handed clampdown on private new economy sectors seems unlikely given their importance in underpinning China's economic vision for a modern productive, consumption-led economy.'As a result, we remain positive about the long-term prospects for Chinese equities.'143 of Fortune's top 500 global companies this year were Chinese, including retailer JD.comExperts fear meddling from governmentDarius McDermott, managing director at fund scrutineer Chelsea Financial Services, says that the Chinese government's clampdown on key business sectors represents a warning to investors about the risks of investing in Chinese equities.He says: 'Does the Chinese government want to totally destroy the idea of stock market investing while still having foreign investors investing in their country?'The answer is probably no, but recent unfriendly regulatory moves clearly represent a power play from them. Investors should take note that further intervention is possible, impacting adversely on some of China's leading listed companies.'Ben Yearsley, investment director at Shore Financial Planning, adds that investors should not be surprised when the Chinese government gets heavy handed.He says: 'China has always been an interventionist economy, so the fact the government has intervened in recent days and months should be no surprise. It is one of the clear risks of investing in Chinese equities.'Hollands says: 'Under Xi Jinping, China has moved in an increasingly hardline direction, and recent interventions signal the Communist regime's desire to stamp its authority on the private sector. Investors should take heed.'KEEP INVESTMENTS MODEST, SAY EXPERTS Most investment experts believe it would be foolish to ignore the Chinese market altogether. 'The long-term case for investing in China's growth story remains intact,' says Dzmitry Lipski, head of funds research at wealth manager Interactive Investor. 'Growth of the middle classes and the recent refocusing of China's economy towards domestic consumption rather than exports are expected to be key drivers of future economic growth and the stock market in the coming years.' However, it is important to be wary, investing only a proportion of your portfolio in Chinese stocks and picking the right sectors and companies. 'It pays to be selective,' says Abrdn's Pruksa Iamthongthong, adding that investors have 'indiscriminately sold off the broader market', meaning there are opportunities to be had. Jason Hollands agrees that Chinese equity prices now look compelling. He says: 'Sentiment towards China has been severely impacted in recent weeks and this has depressed company valuations, particularly in sectors like technology. 'This clearly creates some buying opportunities for long-term investors. But it is important to be prepared for bumps in the road.' He says that regulatory interventions should be seen as an 'inherent risk' and that investors should take an approach that is 'both selective, but sufficiently diversified'. China should only be a 'modest component of an overall wealth portfolio,' adds Holland.Spread the risk with a diversified fundInvesting in Chinese shares is difficult. Due to the rules governing foreign ownership of shares, foreign investors have to buy through 'variable interest entities'.And as Chelsea's McDermott warns, there would be nothing to stop the Chinese government at some stage deciding these structures are worthless.This is the risk you have to take with China, even if you invest in investment funds. But at least a diversified fund spreads risk.Some experts suggest that investors should avoid China-only funds and instead opt for a trust or fund that invests throughout Asia. Tilney's top Asian fund selections include Fidelity Emerging Markets and FSSA Asia Focus.Meanwhile, Chelsea has identified a number of 'elite' Asian funds. These include Fidelity Asian Dividend, Invesco Asian, JPM Asia Growth, Pacific Tiger (managed by Asian specialist Matthews Asia) and investment trust Schroder Oriental Income.Interactive Investor's Dzmitry Lipski likes Fidelity Asia, Guinness Asian Equity Income and investment trust JPMorgan Emerging Markets.An alternative approach is to buy a global investment fund that has limited exposure to China. For example, Scottish Mortgage, the country's largest investment trust, has a fifth of its investments in Chinese equities \u2013 the likes of Tencent and Alibaba.But its global investment remit means it has not been hit as hard performance wise as some Asian or China-only funds. Over the past year, it has still managed to achieve a total return for shareholders in excess of 50 per cent.For those who prefer a pure China fund, Lipski suggests Fidelity China Special Situations. The trust, which has generated a return of 64 per cent over the past three years, has been managed by Dale Nicholls since April 2014.Lipski adds: 'Due to the single country focus and its bias towards small and mid-sized Chinese companies, its investment return profile is volatile, making it high-risk, and should represent no more than a satellite holding in a well-diversified portfolio.'Chelsea's McDermott suggests FSSA Greater China Growth, managed by Martin Lau, which he says 'has proven its ability to perform in any market environment'.The fund has made losses of five per cent over the past six months, but it has delivered respectable gains of 52 per cent over the past three years.He also likes trusts Fidelity China Special Situations and JPMorgan China Growth & Income which has taken a 27 per cent hit over the past six months \u2013 but is up 129 per cent over three years.Investors should expect this level of price volatility to continue as China's economic transformation marches on \u2013 despite a government intent on dictating what its biggest companies can and cannot do.",

La sua enorme popolarit\u00e0 \u00e8 diffusa in tutta la Cina: \u00e8 possibile trovare una bottiglia di baijiu pressoch\u00e9 a ogni evento e celebrazione, dai ricevimenti nuziali agli incontri sociali. Il baijiu \u00e8 parte essenziale della cultura imprenditoriale cinese ed \u00e8 servito nelle cene d'affari, al fine di onorare i commensali e dimostrare rispetto e amicizia. Inoltre, il baijiu di fascia alta rappresenta un prestigioso regalo, offerto anche ai politici stranieri: \u00e8 stato utilizzato per brindare durante eventi diplomatici ufficiali, come la storica visita del 1972 del presidente Usa Nixon a Pechino.La produzione e il consumo di questo distillato a base di cereali, ottenuto da sorgo, grano, riso, mais e fermentato utilizzando un agente fermentante denominato \u00abqu\u00bb, risale a pi\u00f9 di mille anni fa ed \u00e8 la bevanda alcolica pi\u00f9 consumata in Cina. Secondo gli ultimi dati diffusi da China Alcoholic Drinks Association, le vendite di baijiu hanno rappresentato il 70% dei ricavi totali dei produttori cinesi di bevande alcoliche nel 2020, in un mercato che include produttori di birra e vino. Il fatturato totale del settore ha raggiunto i 584 miliardi di renminbi (76,1 mld di euro) nel 2020, in crescita rispetto ai 562 mld registrati nel 2019. Il numero di produttori \u00e8 diminuito dai 1.600 nel 2017 ai 1.040 operanti nel 2020, a causa del crescente consolidamento e concentrazione di mercato. Di questi, 19 sono societ\u00e0 quotate in borsa, a Shanghai e Shenzhen, e insieme rappresentano il 41% del mercato. I principali produttori sono Kweichow Moutai, che controlla il 17% del mercato, Wuliangye (10%), Yanghe (4%) e Luzhou Laojiao (3%) e sono principalmente focalizzati nella distillazione di baijiu di fascia alta.Kweichow Moutai produce le bottiglie di baijiu pi\u00f9 prestigiose e apprezzate, con 95 miliardi di renminbi di fatturato (su un totale di 98 mld) derivanti dalle vendite del liquore. Fondata a Zunyi, nella provincia di Guizhou, Moutai \u00e8 anche una delle aziende di maggior valore a livello mondiale, con una capitalizzazione di mercato di oltre 2.600 mld di renminbi (circa 400 mld di dollari, 339 mld di euro), superiore rispetto ai ben pi\u00f9 noti Coca Cola, Pepsi e Diageo. Moutai \u00e8 un marchio molto ricercato e le sue bottiglie baijiu di fascia alta sono considerate uno status symbol per il loro prezzo elevato, che supera facilmente i 300 dollari. Wuliangye, con sede a Yibin, nella provincia del Sichuan, \u00e8 il secondo maggiore produttore cinese e si concentra principalmente sui baijiu dall'aroma forte. Le vendite del liquore hanno generato oltre 44 mld di renminbi nel 2020, e il valore di mercato del gruppo ha superato i 1.160 mld (circa 170 mld di dollari). Altri grandi operatori del settore con ricavi generati da vendite di baijiu superiori ai 10 mld di renminbi includono Jiangsu Yanghe (e il suo brand Mengzhilan), Luzhou Laojiao, Shanxi Fenjiu, Beijing Shunxin (Niulanshan) e Anhui Gujing. Oltre ai produttori pi\u00f9 importanti, vengono apprezzate dai consumatori etichette pi\u00f9 di nicchia, come lo Shuijingfang, il Laobaigan, il Gongjiu, e baijiu di fascia pi\u00f9 bassa come il Red Star Erguotou.Il mercato oggigiorno richiede ai produttori di baijiu la capacit\u00e0 di innovare e migliorare costantemente la tecnologia di produzione e di prestare maggiore attenzione ai nuovi consumatori, in Cina e all'estero: attualmente, il principale gruppo di consumatori del baijiu ha infatti pi\u00f9 di 60 anni, mentre i pi\u00f9 giovani mostrano meno affetto per il \u00abliquore bianco\u00bb, preferendo altre bevande alcoliche, come whisky e liquori \u00aboccidentali\u00bb.Il baijiu sta diventando sempre pi\u00f9 conosciuto anche fuori dal suo paese d'origine, con un numero crescente di consumatori stranieri che iniziano ad apprezzarne il sapore intenso. Il World Baijiu Day, un evento nato da un'idea di un canadese residente in Cina, viene celebrato ogni nono giorno del mese di agosto (da 8 \u00abba\u00bb e 9 \u00abjiu\u00bb, la cui pronuncia \u00e8 simile a quella di baijiu), al fine di promuovere il liquore cinese oltre i confini di Pechino.* economista Shanghai University"

It continues to host mass events, including Euro 2020 football fixtures in Saint Petersburg.The surge in infections prompted President Vladimir Putin this week to once again urge Russians to get vaccinated in an annual televised phone-in session with the nation.The Kremlin stressed Friday that a new lockdown was off the table.\u201cNobody wants any lockdowns, and yes, it is not up for debate,\u201d said Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov. \u201cIt is not being discussed.\u201dSaint Petersburg, Russia\u2019s second city, on Friday recorded 101 deaths, just shy of its record from earlier in the week of 119.Organisers have said the Euro 2020 Spain vs. Switzerland quarter-final later Friday will go ahead despite the high infection rates, in front of thousands of spectators.Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin has said the Delta variant now accounts for 90 percent of new cases in the city.Sobyanin has ordered offices to send home a third of their workforces, except employees who had been vaccinated, and said 60 percent of people working in the service industry must be fully inoculated by mid-August.\u2013 \u2018I want to feel safe\u2019 \u2013Moscow\u2019s restaurants have been told to only allow indoors patrons who have been vaccinated or infected in the past six months.Vaccine hesitancy has been a huge challenge for the Russian authorities but the new restrictions appear to be working.On Friday, AFP journalists saw hundreds of people waiting at vaccination points across the city of more than 12 million.\u201cI\u2019ve been queueing for about two hours already,\u201d student Svetlana Stepereva said in Sokolniki park in northeast Moscow.The 21-year-old said it was time to get vaccinated, pointing to the ever-tightening restrictions.\u201cI want to get a jab and feel safe.\u201dMikhail Shutov, the head of a Moscow clinic, told AFP at the park that there was a clear increase in the number of people who wanted to be inoculated.\u201cThere are definitely more people who want to get vaccinated for the first time,\u201d he said.The Kremlin had set a goal of fully inoculating 60 percent of Russia\u2019s population by September, but conceded this week it would not be able to meet that target, even though free jabs have been available since early December.Sobyanin this week urged Muscovites inoculated more than six months ago to get a booster jab with the country\u2019s homegrown Sputnik V vaccine or the one-dose Sputnik Light.Russia, with 136,565 deaths from the virus, has the highest official toll from Covid-19 in Europe \u2014 even as authorities have been accused of downplaying the severity of the country\u2019s outbreak.by Nikolay KORZHOV",

You can opt-out at any time.AdvertisementTwenty-four bottles of Kweichow Moutai baijiu sold for a record-breaking $1.4 million at a Sotheby's auction last month.Kweichow Moutai baijiu is known as the national liquor of China and has been a staple of the elites and ruling class since the Chinese republic was formed.Chinese Chairman Mao Zedong served it to US president Richard Nixon in 1972 and it also made an appearance in a 2013 state banquet when Chinese President Xi Jinping met US President Barack Obama.A bottle usually starts from about $100 but could go as high as $8,000 on Chinese e-commerce site Taobao.AdvertisementThis particular batch that was auctioned was produced during China's chaotic Cultural Revolution period from 1966 to 1976. The 1974 bottle features a sunflower logo instead of the usual flying fairy. According to Sotheby's, the logo was changed in that period because a flying fairy was \"deemed inappropriate.\"It had an initial estimated value of between $276,000 and $552,000 but a fiery bidding war between 14 bidders tipped the price to over a million dollars.Insider has reached out to Sothebys for comment.What is Kweichow Moutai baijiu?Baijiu (white alcohol) is a popular and fiery spirit in China made of sorghum and wheat. It has an alcohol content of between 35% and 53% and is known for being potent and pungent.AdvertisementThere are many brands of baijiu, but Kweichow Moutai \u2014 made in Maotai village in the mountainous province of Guizhou in the southwest of China \u2014 is considered to be the premium choice. The liquor is produced only in small batches, giving it an air of scarcity and luxury.The company is the most valuable alcohol producer in the world and is valued at about $400 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal.Besides being a popular drink, bottles are also stockpiled as investments, as prices tend to appreciate.In Guizhou province, a family sold a dozen bottles for $38,000 to pay for their child's apartment downpayment in Beijing, according to a Reuters report.Advertisement\"Moutai is not only for drinking, it is a social tool, an identity indicator. As people believe older Moutai will be only more valuable, there is little risk in hoarding,\" liquor industry analyst Cai Xuefei told Reuters.",

            "description": "Photo: Screenshot of Moutai Wine online shopA limited-edition new product recently launched by the wine subsidiary of Kweichow Moutai Group has drawn market attention to the top Chinese liquor distiller's move beyond its traditional strength.The new wine, unveiled over the weekend at Moutai's manor in Changli, North China's Hebei Province, is limited to only 9,999 bottles priced at 3,299 yuan ($510.85) apiece.An expert advisory board for Moutai wine was also set up at the launch event.Prior to the new offering, the wine subsidiary, founded in 2002, had rolled out an array of products with price tags ranging from 59 yuan to 1,280 yuan, according to media reports.Unlike the Shanghai-listed arm that has made Moutai known as the king of liquor, the wine unit has largely been invisible.After posting losses in 2017, Moutai's wine subsidiary saw its operating income rise to 218 million yuan last year from 130 million yuan in 2018. The wine unit disclosed in April its plans to float on the A-share market by 2025.Nonetheless, the wine business' IPO ambitions seem to have been clouded by sluggishness in the domestic wine sector. Profits at the country's 155 major wine firms plunged 74.48 percent year-on-year to 259 million yuan in 2020, industry data showed.By comparison, the listed arm, noted for its signature Feitian 53 range that retails for 1,499 yuan, recorded 98 billion yuan in overall operating income in 2020, up 10.29 percent year-on-year, according to its annual fiscal disclosure.In a sign of the insane popularity of Moutai's hot-selling fiery products, photos of a new variant of the Feitian 53 range that comes in a Tiffany blue bottle were disseminated among liquor distributors starting Friday, and in less than 24 hours, the asking price for the new model skyrocketed to 8,500 yuan per bottle, China Fund News reported Monday.Shares of Moutai ended up 0.53 percent on Monday, outperforming a 0.03 percent drop in the flagship Shanghai Composite Index.",

            "description": "La vigne cultiv\u00e9e en agriculture biologique, a permis de d\u00e9velopper un M\u00e9doc d\u2019exception, disponible aupr\u00e8s de distributeurs agr\u00e9\u00e9s ou sur le site du ch\u00e2teau Loudenne.Au fil des si\u00e8cles !Ici, le premier travail date d\u2019un million d\u2019ann\u00e9es : depuis que la Gironde traverse le M\u00e9doc pour se jeter dans la mer. Elle d\u00e9pose progressivement pierres et alluvions au fil des glaciations et r\u00e9chauffements successifs. D\u00e9p\u00f4t, \u00e9rosion, d\u00e9p\u00f4t, \u00e9rosion\u2026 Le fleuve travaille. Apr\u00e8s chaque glaciation il creuse son lit pour rejoindre la mer dont le niveau baissait. Galets, graviers, sables, argiles\u2026 Apr\u00e8s la derni\u00e8re \u00e8re glaciaire, il y a 20 000 ans, tout un processus, avec les nombreuses rivi\u00e8res perpendiculaires \u00e0 l'estuaire, les \u00ab esteys \u00bb, a concouru \u00e0 la formation des croupes, ces collines constitu\u00e9es de graves.Puis \u00e0 partir du 17\u00e8me si\u00e8cle, c\u2019est le travail humain qui a pris la rel\u00e8ve : avec la cr\u00e9ation de digues et d\u2019\u00e9cluses, les marais ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ass\u00e9ch\u00e9s, des terres fertiles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cultiv\u00e9es, lib\u00e9rant les croupes pour qu\u2019y soit plant\u00e9e\u2026 la vigne ! Le d\u00e9cor mill\u00e9naire est cultiv\u00e9, un climat tr\u00e8s doux prot\u00e8ge la vigne du gel, et en automne favorise la maturation du raisin\u2026 et nous arrivons en l\u2019an 1670, dans un Ch\u00e2teau bien singulier, en bordure de Gironde, situ\u00e9 entre deux chemins de Saint-Jacques de Compostelle, la voie littoral passant par Soulac, et la voie jacquaire en provenance de Tours Via Tunorensis, qui apr\u00e8s une travers\u00e9e de l\u2019estuaire depuis Talmont, ou Blaye class\u00e9 UNESCO aujourd\u2019hui, permettait de rejoindre les rives du M\u00e9doc, \u00e0 Saint-Christoly-M\u00e9doc, Port de By \u2026 et poursuivre leur chemin.Laissons-nous conduire par Philippe de Poyferr\u00e9 directeur, depuis 2017, de Ch\u00e2teau Loudenne, qui va nous r\u00e9v\u00e9ler bien des choses.Quand une petite chartreuse devient la petite Angleterre du M\u00e9docVraiment singuli\u00e8re cette histoire que nous raconte Philippe de Poyferr\u00e9 avec ferveur !En 1670 une petite chartreuse est construite de plain-pied, sans \u00e9tage. L\u2019un de ces petits ch\u00e2teaux de l\u2019\u00e9poque, dans un M\u00e9doc qui \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t pauvre. Rien \u00e0 voir avec les grands ch\u00e2teaux construits dans le M\u00e9doc au 19\u00e8me si\u00e8cle. Une famille noble bordelaise a \u00e9t\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire de Ch\u00e2teau Loudenne qui \u00e9tait sa r\u00e9sidence secondaire jusqu\u2019en 1875. C\u2019est donc un bonheur qu\u2019il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 conserv\u00e9, car beaucoup de petites chartreuses ont laiss\u00e9 place aux constructions fastueuses que l\u2019on admire aujourd\u2019hui. Et c\u2019est alors que commence une histoire singuli\u00e8re, car les nouveaux propri\u00e9taires sont des n\u00e9gociants anglais, les Fr\u00e8res Alfred et Walter Gilbey, n\u00e9gociants en Gin qui voulaient devenir n\u00e9gociants\u2026 en vin. Loudenne est au Nord de Saint-Est\u00e8phe, c\u2019est la partie sauvage du M\u00e9doc.Les Fr\u00e8res Gilbey ont achet\u00e9 un ch\u00e2teau qui \u00e9tait proche de l\u2019embouchure pour \u00e9viter d\u2019amener leur bateau jusqu\u2019\u00e0 Bordeaux\u2026 \u00e7a leur \u00e9conomisait trois jours de navigation. C\u2019est la seule propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui jouisse d\u2019un port priv\u00e9 dans l\u2019estuaire de la Gironde. Les berges de l\u2019estuaire, en effet, appartiennent toutes au domaine maritime, sauf \u00e0 Loudenne. Nous sommes toujours propri\u00e9taires des berges, \u00e7a date des Anglais, nous dit Philippe de Poyferr\u00e9.Les bateaux partaient de Londres, chargeaient les barriques dans l\u2019estuaire et repartaient \u00e0 Londres. \u00c7a leur \u00e9vitait sans doute aussi quelques taxes et Octrois pr\u00e9lev\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 Bordeaux. Loudenne devient donc une v\u00e9ritable plateforme logistique, en m\u00eame temps qu\u2019un immense chai modernis\u00e9 par nos fortun\u00e9s anglais qui y impriment imm\u00e9diatement une dimension nouvelle : en 1876, ils construisent un nouveau chai qui utilise le principe de la gravit\u00e9.Mais ils impriment leur marque plus largement. Loudenne a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 producteur et n\u00e9gociant. Un double statut qui en fait un lieu de production et un lieu de repr\u00e9sentation\u2026 avec ses heures de gloire \u00e0 deux p\u00e9riodes ! Les ann\u00e9es folles et l\u2019apr\u00e8s-guerre.Le ch\u00e2teau roseLoudenne, le ch\u00e2teau rose du M\u00e9doc, c\u2019\u00e9tait une petite Angleterre au sein du M\u00e9doc. Les anciens se souviennent bien qu\u2019avant de d\u00eener, il y en avait toujours un qui jouait de la cornemuse et amenait tout le monde en procession jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la salle \u00e0 manger. Il y avait aussi un terrain de cricket. Les Anglais ont vraiment fa\u00e7onn\u00e9 Loudenne tel qu\u2019il est aujourd\u2019hui. Ils ont construit le chai, le parc, les quatre petites tours en haut des buttes de grave. Aujourd\u2019hui le ch\u00e2teau rose est tr\u00e8s proche de ce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait au moment de la p\u00e9riode de gloire des Anglais.Au fait, nous avons des quantit\u00e9s de rosiers \u00e0 Loudenne ! L\u2019embl\u00e8me de Loudenne, c\u2019est la rose. Nous avons une roseraie ancienne qui est assez unique et les murs du ch\u00e2teau sont roses. Loudenne est connu comme le ch\u00e2teau rose.Aujourd\u2019hui, c\u2019est toujours un lieu de r\u00e9ception, lou\u00e9 exclusivement dans un cadre d\u2019activit\u00e9s professionnelles et utilis\u00e9 pour recevoir des clients. Avant le Covid au ch\u00e2teau j\u2019ai re\u00e7u 250 personnes, en d\u00e9gustation, repas et qui ont pu y dormir. Nous ouvrons les portes \u00e0 des critiques qui veulent faire des d\u00e9gustations, \u00e0 des acheteurs\u2026 Nous avons 14 chambres et plusieurs lieux o\u00f9 on peut d\u00e9jeuner de fa\u00e7on informelle, notamment la cuisine des vendangeurs\u2026 ou dans la salle \u00e0 manger qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement red\u00e9cor\u00e9e en partenariat avec Baccarat. On peut faire des grillades sur la terrasse, dans la cuisine des vendangeurs ou recevoir de fa\u00e7on extr\u00eamement formelle dans la salle \u00e0 manger.Mais \u00e0 qui appartient Loudenne aujourd\u2019hui, \u00e0 tous ?D\u00e9j\u00e0 il appartient au M\u00e9doc. C\u2019est la base. C\u2019est un site embl\u00e9matique que personne ne sortira du M\u00e9doc. C\u2019est un site ouvert. Il n\u2019y a pas de barri\u00e8res \u00e0 Loudenne. Tout le monde peut venir s\u2019y promener. Au contraire, j\u2019encourage tous les m\u00e9docains et toutes les personnes qui vivent autour \u00e0 venir s\u2019y promener. De plus, la visite est gratuite et sans rendez-vous, ce qui est assez inhabituel. Dans le monde bordelais il faut g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement montrer patte blanche. L\u00e0 c\u2019est un lieu de promenade, absolument magnifique, que l\u2019on peut partager, o\u00f9 les gens peuvent venir faire leur jogging.Pour le reste j\u2019aurais plut\u00f4t tendance \u00e0 dire qu\u2019on a des actionnaires qui ne se comportent absolument pas comme des propri\u00e9taires. Ce qu\u2019ils veulent c\u2019est pr\u00e9server ce site et le d\u00e9velopper. L\u2019actionnariat de Loudenne est une association entre un producteur de spiritueux chinois de Baiju (Kweichow Moutai), qui est une appellation contr\u00f4l\u00e9e et produit la c\u00e9l\u00e8bre eau-de-vie Maotai, et les Cognacs Camus qui appartiennent \u00e0 Cyril Camus. Les Cognacs Camus existent depuis 1863. Cette maison, cr\u00e9\u00e9e par Jean-Baptiste Camus est dirig\u00e9e par la famille Camus depuis cinq g\u00e9n\u00e9rations. Kweichow Moutai et les Cognacs Camus sont associ\u00e9s avec un mode de gestion simple : toutes les grandes d\u00e9cisions strat\u00e9giques se prennent ensemble et la gestion quotidienne du domaine est assur\u00e9e par les Cognacs Camus.Chinois et Cognac sont dans le m\u00eame bateauLes Chinois ont d\u2019abord tout achet\u00e9 puis se sont rendu compte que c\u2019\u00e9tait difficile de g\u00e9rer un ch\u00e2teau \u00e0 distance. Ils sont all\u00e9s voir Cyril Camus avec qui ils avaient un accord de partenariat pour la distribution de leur spiritueux en Duty Free et lui ont demand\u00e9 de g\u00e9rer le quotidien.Le Cognac et le M\u00e9doc c\u2019est tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rent\u2026 C\u2019est bien pour cela qu\u2019ils sont venus me chercher. Cela dit Cyril Camus poss\u00e8de 180 hectares de vignes en Borderies. Les Borderies, au Nord de la rivi\u00e8re Charente, poss\u00e8dent un sous-sol partiellement d\u00e9calcifi\u00e9, ce qui conf\u00e8re aux Eaux de vie un bouquet tr\u00e8s sp\u00e9cifique aux tons de violette ; le vignoble des Borderies, quant \u00e0 lui repr\u00e9sente \u00e0 peine 5% du vignoble de la r\u00e9gion.A Loudenne, j\u2019interviens pour donner les grandes orientations strat\u00e9giques car je connais tr\u00e8s bien le secteur du vin et les march\u00e9s. Les cognacs Camus interviennent assez peu ; on fait un reporting mensuel et ils g\u00e8rent la relation avec les Chinois. Les \u00e9quipes de Camus nous ont aid\u00e9s sur des questions techniques. Nous sommes par exemple certifi\u00e9s Haute Valeur Environnementale (OCACIA) et en transition vers le bio. Cela permet de travailler en \u00e9quipe.Certification environnementale et douceurLa certification environnementale d\u00e9passe le simple cadre du produit. On s\u2019int\u00e9resse \u00e0 tout ce qui fait l\u2019\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me : protection des ruisseaux, les haies, la faune, la flore, ne pas polluer\u2026 C\u2019est une certification Fran\u00e7aise et que nous avons men\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019une d\u00e9marche collective du conseil interprofessionnel des vins de Bordeaux. La certification HVE est celle qui correspond au niveau le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour les exploitations agricoles.Nous l\u2019avons mis en place en 2017. Seules 750 propri\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e9taient alors certifi\u00e9es HVE. Cela nous a amen\u00e9s \u00e0 modifier tout le traitement de nos effluents, qu\u2019ils soient viticoles ou vinicoles.Quand je suis arriv\u00e9 en 2017 j\u2019ai supprim\u00e9 tous les produits CMR (canc\u00e9rog\u00e8nes, reprotoxiques et mutag\u00e8nes). Nous sommes repass\u00e9s au travail du sol pour supprimer le glyphosate. Ensuite nous sommes pass\u00e9s en conversion au bio en 2019. C\u2019est une d\u00e9marche qui implique aussi bien des changements de mentalit\u00e9 que de m\u00e9thode de travail et de mat\u00e9riel. C\u2019est une d\u00e9marche qui se pr\u00e9pare avec rigueur si on veut la r\u00e9ussir. En deux ans nous avons chang\u00e9 de directeur d\u2019exploitation, rachet\u00e9 cinq tracteurs, cinq pulv\u00e9risateurs\u2026 et recrut\u00e9 cinq tractoristes. Tout cela a un co\u00fbt.Le bio est compl\u00e9mentaire \u00e0 la d\u00e9marche Haute Valeur Environnementale, car cela revient \u00e0 se pr\u00e9occuper de la sant\u00e9 des consommateurs en n\u2019utilisant que des produits naturels. Il faut faire revivre la terre et cela prend du temps. La plante doit aussi r\u00e9apprendre \u00e0 se d\u00e9fendre toute seule. A force de traiter syst\u00e9matiquement on a supprim\u00e9 la d\u00e9fense immunitaire de la vigne. La vigne est un \u00eatre vivant. Elle doit cr\u00e9er ses d\u00e9fenses. Et \u00e7a prend un peu de temps quand on repasse en bio.Cette ann\u00e9e, vous le savez, tout a \u00e9t\u00e9 gel\u00e9. Mais \u00e0 Loudenne, la vigne n\u2019a pas gel\u00e9. Nous avons des conditions climatiques extr\u00eamement particuli\u00e8res du fait de la pr\u00e9sence de la Gironde : la proximit\u00e9 de la rivi\u00e8re et les tr\u00e8s nombreux cailloux du sol qui refl\u00e8tent les rayons du soleil.Nous avons beaucoup de biodiversit\u00e9. Nous sommes entour\u00e9s de pr\u00e9s sal\u00e9s. Nous les avons pr\u00eat\u00e9s \u00e0 notre voisin qui les utilise pour faire de l\u2019\u00e9levage. A l\u2019entr\u00e9e de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, on a un nid de cigognes qui sont revenues depuis cinq ans. Nous utilisons des produits de bio contr\u00f4le. Ils ont un impact pour emp\u00eacher le d\u00e9veloppement de certaines maladies.Ce qui est complexe dans la viticulture biologique, c\u2019est qu\u2019il n\u2019existe que des produits de protection. Il n\u2019y a aucun produit curatif. Nous n\u2019avons par exemple que du cuivre pour prot\u00e9ger du mildiou, la principale maladie du bordelais. Si vous n\u2019en mettez pas sur les feuilles avant qu\u2019il pleuve, il va s\u2019implanter et vous ne pourrez plus rien faire pour le supprimer. Vous pouvez perdre toute votre r\u00e9colte. C\u2019est pourquoi nous avons rachet\u00e9 des pulv\u00e9risateurs, car il faut que nous soyons en mesure de traiter les 50ha de vigne en une seule journ\u00e9e. Donc il nous faut cinq tracteurs, cinq pulv\u00e9risateurs et cinq tractoristes. Nous devons traiter plus souvent mais nous utilisons le cuivre \u00e0 des doses extr\u00eamement faibles \u00e0 chaque fois.March\u00e9s, renomm\u00e9e, et avenirEtant donn\u00e9 son histoire, Loudenne est une marque qui a une certaine renomm\u00e9e, notamment dans les pays anglo-saxons : Angleterre, Etats-Unis, le Canada\u2026 etc. Mais il y a eu une quinzaine d\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019oubli et d\u2019absence de dynamique commerciale. Le ch\u00e2teau a \u00e9t\u00e9 revendu par les Anglais en 2000, puis repris par Camus en 2016. Cette renomm\u00e9e, nous sommes donc en train de la reconstruire.Nos plus gros march\u00e9s ce sont la Chine, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 notre actionnaire, mais aussi la France o\u00f9 nous ne sommes pas du tout vendus en grande distribution. Nous sommes donc connus dans un cr\u00e9neau de consommateurs avertis. Nous sommes \u00e9galement tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9sents aux Etats-Unis et au Japon. Ces quatre pays sont nos march\u00e9s les plus importants mais nous sommes vendus dans une soixantaine de pays. L\u2019une des particularit\u00e9s de Loudenne c\u2019est que nous n\u2019avons pas de distribution par le n\u00e9goce de place de Bordeaux. Nous avons des distributeurs exclusifs sur chacun des march\u00e9s. En Chine, par notre actionnaire et dans le monde, par la force commerciale des cognacs Camus. Nous essayons d\u2019\u00eatre vendus plut\u00f4t chez des cavistes et dans des restaurants.La crise du Covid nous a fait du mal car les deux circuits qui ont d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s leurs ventes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 internet et la grande distribution. Nos bouteilles sont assez ch\u00e8res et distribu\u00e9es dans des tranches de prix entre vingt et vingt-cinq euros. Ce sont des bouteilles que vous achetez quand vous recevez des amis chez vous. Or en confinement vous ne recevez pas, donc vous n\u2019achetez pas. C\u2019est pourquoi nous avons beaucoup souffert de la crise sanitaire mais aussi de la surtaxe Trump.Actuellement, avec les Etats-Unis, nous sommes dans un moratoire de quatre mois et l\u2019Europe est en train de ren\u00e9gocier toutes les taxes et de les annuler d\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9 comme de l\u2019autre. Nos exp\u00e9ditions sont bien reparties gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 tous ces facteurs. Mais il est vrai que cela nous a amen\u00e9 \u00e0 nous poser des questions et \u00e0 nous remettre en question. Nous avons ainsi d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 ainsi la vente par internet directement via notre site mais aussi avec d\u2019autres partenaires.Notre principale production \u00e0 Loudenne est le vin rouge. Nous avons aussi une particularit\u00e9 \u00e0 Loudenne ce sont des vignes de blanc. Loudenne a le plus ancien vignoble de blanc du M\u00e9doc, implant\u00e9 par les Anglais en 1880. Loudenne a toujours produit du blanc. Historiquement dans le M\u00e9doc il y a toujours eu quelques vignes de blanc pour une production personnelle mais Loudenne a produit du blanc pour le commercialiser. Le deuxi\u00e8me plus ancien c\u2019est Margaux dans les ann\u00e9es 1920.Nous produisons aussi un tout petit peu de ros\u00e9, mais un vrai ! Souvent \u00e0 Bordeaux les ros\u00e9s sont des sous-produits de vinification des rouges. A Loudenne, le ros\u00e9, c\u2019est une petite parcelle de jeune Merlot d\u00e9di\u00e9e, r\u00e9colt\u00e9e avant maturit\u00e9, obtenu par pressurage direct\u2026 c\u2019est un vrai ros\u00e9 type Provence \u00e0 la couleur tr\u00e8s pale.Des projets, toujoursNous avons un projet de restructuration du chai. Nous avons pr\u00e9vu de r\u00e9nover les b\u00e2timents et de de refaire la cuverie. Ce projet devait se faire en 2022 mais avec la crise du COVID, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en attente pour le moment. Mon v\u0153u pour Loudenne c\u2019est que les actionnaires poursuivent ce projet et aillent au bout.Pour ma part je serai \u00e0 la retraite dans deux ou trois ans. Je suis un passeur. J\u2019ai repris la direction de ce ch\u00e2teau qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en tr\u00e8s bon \u00e9tat. Loudenne c\u2019est un bijou. C\u2019est un endroit qu\u2019il faut absolument venir visiter. Si je me pr\u00e9occupe de la partie environnementale et bio, c\u2019est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment parce que nous ne sommes que des passeurs. C\u2019est un site historique. Il appartient au M\u00e9doc. J\u2019ai envie que ce site vive et continue \u00e0 vivre pour les g\u00e9n\u00e9rations \u00e0 venir. \u00c7a c\u2019est mon v\u0153u \u00e0 titre personnel.Merci \u00e0 Philippe de Poyferr\u00e9, qui est aussi un passeur d\u2019histoires !Et vous, quel est votre v\u0153u ?Bien \u00e9videmment d\u2019aller se promener dans cette r\u00e9gion du M\u00e9doc et d\u00e9couvrir Ch\u00e2teau Loudenne avec son jardin remarquable, dans ce site magnifique et singulier.Et puis, se procurer ces bouteilles qui se partagent avec des amis !Ah ! Vous \u00eates loin de ce magnifique parc, de l\u2019estuaire, du merveilleux petit port ?Loudenne vient \u00e0 vous : https://chateau-loudenne.com/collections/tous-les-produits"

            "description": "A worker pours wine at a winery in Yinchuan, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in 2015. GOH CHAI HIN | AFP | Getty ImagesBEIJING \u2014 Fresh off a surge in wine exports and a visit from President Xi Jinping last year, China wants to turn its primary wine-producing region of Ningxia into one that rivals France's Bordeaux. By 2035, Ningxia's Helan Mountains area aims to produce 600 million bottles worth 20 billion yuan ($3.12 billion), according to a plan the central government approved in late May. The region along the Yellow River is about a two hours' flight west from Beijing and lies in a latitude similar to that of France's famed wine country. \"If this goal can be achieved, Helan Mountains' eastern foothills will become an internationally important and influential production area, with a scale matching that of Bordeaux,\" Sui Pengfei, director of international cooperation at China's agriculture ministry told reporters last week in Mandarin, according to a CNBC translation.watch nowNingxia is just one of several wine-producing areas in China, but its Helan Mountains' eastern foothills has a diverse variety of grapes on par with that of Bordeaux or Napa Valley in the U.S., and accounts for the majority of domestic wine production, Sui said. Even if the 15-year target is more than quadruple Ningxia's annual wine production, the numbers roughly match up to those of France's wine capital. Bordeaux produced 522 million bottles worth 3.5 billion euros ($4.16 billion) last year, according to a French industry group. Like many high-level Chinese plans, the one for wine is vague on implementation details. Instead, it lays out a framework for development that ranges from improving local winemaking knowledge and ecological conservation to \"a window\" for China's wine to \"integrate with the world,\" according to a CNBC translation of the Chinese text.Last year, during the coronavirus pandemic, Ningxia's wine exports rose 46.4% to 2.65 million yuan (about $414,100), according to the local customs agency. Primary destinations included the U.S., the European Union, Australia and Japan. Ningxia-based winery Xige Estate exported some wine to Canada last year, founder Zhang Yanzhi told CNBC. His company started exporting to Switzerland, Japan, Hong Kong and France in small amounts this year, he said, adding that there are plans to enter the U.S. market as well. However, he said he plans to focus on the Chinese market, with exports accounting for just 10% to 20% of production in the long term. China ranks sixth in global wine consumption and tenth in production by liters, according to an annual report released in April by the International Organisation of Vine and Wine. The report noted that China's wine consumption and production have declined over the last few years, potentially due to difficult climate conditions and low productivity. These issues \"are making the Chinese wine industry less competitive compared to imported wines,\" the authors wrote.Imports of Australian wine plungeThe central government's push this year to further develop vineyards in Ningxia comes as China's relations with Australia deteriorate. The country was China's largest source of foreign-made wine in 2020, slightly above France, but Chinese tariffs imposed in March have essentially blocked further wine imports from Australia.watch nowWhile Australian producers have found new buyers in the U.K., U.S. and Southeast Asia, it will probably take three or four years to recover losses \u2014 and not all the roughly 1,000 China-focused wine exporters will survive, said Tony Battaglene, chief executive of Australian Grape and Wine, an industry interest group. He said Australian businesses still hope to re-enter the Chinese market when the tariffs are set to expire in five years, and that Australian wine experts can help Chinese producers navigate climate-related problems that both face.Rivals at home for Chinese wine",

            "description": "A two-month consultation process will end on June 18 and both requirements are deemed controversial as they could be implemented from January 1, 2022. The exchange, disappointed with the current rate by listed companies, is also seeking mandatory disclosure on the progress leading to their numerical targets and timelines at board-level and across workforce.The proposal, which forms part of new environment, social and governance (ESG) rules put forth by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), also requires all new listing candidates to have at least one woman on their boards at the time of going public. Existing listed entities will be given a three-year window to comply.About one-third of Hong Kong-listed companies will need to appoint at least one woman director by 2025 or face a penalty under a stock exchange proposal to catch up with progress in gender diversity efforts elsewhere. It can expect some strong opposition.\u201cDiversity is an important driver of the board\u2019s effectiveness,\u201d the exchange said, according to the consultation paper. \u201cIt brings unique perspectives to the boardroom and enhances board performance\u201d and single-gender boards are \u201cnot acceptable,\u201d it added.Pedestrians in face masks are seen outside the HKEX\u2019s headquarters at Exchange Square in Central, Hong Kong. Photo: Sam TsangWhile Hong Kong prides itself as the third-largest stock market in Asia-Pacific and a favourite listing venue over the past decade or so, representation of women in corporate boardrooms left much to be desired and lagged behind some emerging and developed markets.More than 800 listed companies, or about 32 per cent, had all-male board members while the rest had at least one woman as a director at the end of 2020, according to exchange data. There were 2,550 listed companies in Hong Kong in May, with a combined market capitalisation of HK$53.3 trillion (US$6.9 trillion), according to exchange data.The shortfall was also noticeable for Hong Kong-domiciled companies represented in some of MSCI\u2019s influential global indices.Within the MSCI All-Country World Index, they stood at 12.7 per cent in October 2020 versus 12.4 per cent in 2019, according to a report published by the MSCI group in November. Hong Kong was among the few markets which saw an increase in the number of all-male boards, to 37 per cent from 32 per cent over the same period.\u201cAt HKEX, we are committed to enhancing the quality of our market, and this consultation focuses on improving a range of corporate governance standards,\u201d Bonnie Chan, head of listing , said in April when announcing the consultation. Improving board diversity could help enhance Hong Kong\u2019s position as a leading ESG hub in Asia.\u201dUnder the proposal, failure to comply could attract a range of penalties from a public reprimand to denial of access to fundraising facilities, training, suspension of trading and a delisting.Head of Listing Bonnie Chan in an October 2020 file picture. Photo: Winson WongWhile some industry groups are on board with the stock exchange\u2019s gender diversity agenda, the proposal has stoked opposition to the compulsory nature of the requirements.\u201cWe support the direction for diversity in board membership but it should not just focus on gender,\u201d said Stephen Law, a council member of Hong Kong Independent Non-Executive Director Association. \u201cIt should also consider age, knowledge, industry and culture, and we prefer the exchange to not adopt a compulsory approach.\u201dSome industries such as construction, information technology and certain manufacturing sectors have found it difficult to recruit women directors, he said by phone. Companies with all-male boards should be given a chance to explain their circumstances, he added.These groups included Meituan, JD.com, China Mobile and Xiaomi Corp, according to the MSCI report. In mainland markets, it highlighted Kweichow Moutai, Citic Securities, Hangzhou Hikvision and China Petroleum and Chemical Corp.Kweichow Moutai is among top 25 companies with all-male board members, according to an MSCI report in November. Photo: BloombergMike Wong, chief executive of the Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies, said a quota or compulsory stipulation \u201cwould not be ideal.\u201dCompany directors should be appointed \u201cbecause of their knowledge and ability, and not due to their gender,\u201d he added.Also among the stock exchange supporters is Allan Zeman, chairman of Lan Kwai Fong Group who also sits on the board of six listed companies.\u201c[Women] can bring different perspectives to the boardroom,\u201d he said by phone. \u201cThere are a lot of talented women in town with different professional [qualifications] and backgrounds. Companies may need to spend some effort to recruit [them], but it is not mission impossible.\u201dAu King-lun, executive director of the Financial Services Development Council, an advisory body for Hong Kong\u2019s strategic development as an international financial centre, said it was already an international trend to have more women in boardrooms.Some emerging and developed markets have made board representation by women mandatory with specific target ratios and milestones, while others have turned to a comply-or-explain model, according to the MSCI report.\u201cIt is the right direction and I fully support the HKEX proposal,\u201d said Winnie Wong, chief executive of Asia Insurance. \u201cCurrently it\u2019s still an old-boys club for [many] listed companies in Hong Kong,\u201d she said, adding that those already with women as members are narrowly represented by a few popular ones, or those with family connections.",

            "description": "In this article we will take a look at the 15 largest beverage companies by market cap. You can skip our detailed analysis of the beverage industry\u2019s outlook for 2021, and some of the major growth catalysts for beverage stocks and go directly to the 5 Largest Beverage Companies by Market Cap.The best thing to do in the scorching heat is to grab a chilled drink and relax. Whether it's because you've had a long day or just because the sun's blazing too much, a nice drink is enough to quench your thirst and leave you feeling refreshed, so it's not too surprising that beverage companies these days are enormously profitable.You might be thinking just how much money one can make by selling water, but that's where you would be making a mistake. While inclusive of water, the word beverage means so much more than just that, and believe it or not, the industry itself is highly profitable. The popularity of sodas and cold drinks has been rising for years now, with some of the most notable examples being Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO) and PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ: PEP). Coca-Cola Co's (NYSE: KO) net income in 2019 stood at $8.92 billion, while PepsiCo Inc's (NASDAQ: PEP) net income for the same year stood at $7.353 billion. It doesn't matter which one you prefer out of the two because both have an incredibly high market value, and these are just two of the hundreds of examples you can find.Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO) and PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ: PEP) notwithstanding, let's look at one more inspirational example in the beverage industry to drive the point home. The Chinese Kweichow Moutai (SSE: 600519), currently the world's biggest distillery with a market cap of $441.55 billion, stands as a company worth more than Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE), Toyota Motor Corporation (TSE: 7203.T), and even Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS). That should give you more of an idea of how much the other companies selling the drinks in your fridge should be worth.Story continuesHowever, more important than anything else is that the beverage industry is one of the most versatile and innovative industries out there. These mega-companies aren't just popping out the same drinks for their consumers to buy every year. Instead, immeasurable effort goes into coming up with the next drink, the next flavor to get the people hooked. After all, when a company turns a necessity like a mere drink into a commodity produced and sold for profit, the possibilities seem endless. Just look at companies such as Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX). They have a wide array of coffees to choose from, from the Doubleshot on Ice to the Cold Brew Coffee, and the list keeps getting longer. More than that, these companies take pride in indisputably satisfying their customers. You can see that in the sort of service Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) provides, what with excellent coffee that you can customize according to your tastes until it's just right for a morning brew or an evening relaxant.The Effects of Coronavirus Pandemic on the Beverage IndustryBe that as it may, it's not possible to ignore the gigantic elephant in the room: the coronavirus pandemic. With the advent of COVID-19, every industry globally took an economic hit \u2013 except perhaps the drug and pharmaceuticals and healthcare industries. The former here had a market size of $324.42 billion in 2019, which is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 13.74% from 2020 to 2027. However, the beverage industry has taken an economic hit in recent years. In 2019, the food and beverage sector was worth $3606.1 billion but according to statistics, due to the pandemic, there was an expected decrease to $3505.3 billion in 2020. Established trends in consumer patterns have rapidly shifted with the onset of the pandemic, and they won't shift back that fast as people across the globe attempt to deal with economic distress.Changing Trends in the Beverage IndustryRegardless of the pandemic, the beverage industry is also being disrupted by changing product popularity, brands, and distribution, apart from just consumerism. In the midst of it all, niche actors tend to take up more of the market share, while every company must strive to remain competitive to have the edge over the others. Non-alcoholic beverage companies have been operating in a wholly different manner as the industry undergoes these transformations. For instance, PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) has begun to keep an eye out for health-conscious consumers and thus purchased the sparkling water company SodaStream in 2018. Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO) made leaps in the tea market years ago with its Honest Tea subsidiary and moved into the coffee market by purchasing Costa Coffee in 2019. Finally, with a greater emphasis on environmentalism in light of the climate action movement all over the world, companies with eco-friendly packaging like Boxed Water begin to one-up those conglomerates stacking plastic bottles on the shelves.All in all, consumers have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus pandemic, and an increased level of importance being put on health and the environment. By 2026, Generation Z \u2013 those individuals born between 1998 and 2017 \u2013 are expected to be the largest generation on the planet, resulting in a buying power of more than $50 billion. With conventional media having no impact on this generation, one that grew up on the internet and smartphones, a greater demand for customization and individualism can be observed. As such, to cater to this rapidly growing consumer base, companies will need to take note of not just what tastes good but what feels good. Lastly, if you put together a pandemic with a generation of people who prefer spending all their time indoors anyway, you get the perfect digital consumer. With government-mandated lockdowns imposed worldwide, online shopping for food and drinks has skyrocketed, as the revenue from food and beverage ecommerce shot up from $13.03 billion in 2019 to $18.7 billion in 2020. Hence the potential of the industry making unprecedented headway in the digital world cannot be ignored.With all that in mind, it won't be surprising to want to keep an eye on the beverage industry and its accomplishments in the coming years. Despite the ups and downs, especially in light of the pandemic, this industry's popularity and utility cannot be overlooked. Thus, we took it upon ourselves to compile a list of the 15 largest beverage companies by market cap, so people know which companies to keep an especially sharp eye on in the future.15 Largest Beverage Companies by Market CapPhoto by Nik Albert on UnsplashOur Methodology:Following is the list of the 15 largest beverage companies by market cap. We based this ranking through data collected on market cap from Google Finance and Yahoo Finance.With this context and industry outlook in mind, let\u2019s start our list of the 15 largest beverage companies by market cap.Largest Beverage Companies by Market CapMarket Capitalization: $37.89 billionRanked 15 on the list of the largest beverage companies by market cap, Brown-Forman Corporation (NYSE: BF-B) is one of the largest American alcoholic beverage company, operating for the past 150 years. It works in over 170 countries and is the name behind Jack Daniel's and Woodford Reserve whiskeys.Market Capitalization: $46.52 billionConstellation Brands is yet another American alcohol company specializing in beer, wine, and spirits. Claiming to deliver powerhouse brands and best-in-class experiences for their customers, this company ranks 14th on the list of largest beverage companies by market cap.13. Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ: MNST)Market Capitalization: $46.52 billionIf you're a college student, you'd most likely be familiar with this name. Monster Beverage Corp (NASDAQ: MNST) has been producing and selling a wide variety of energy drinks for as long as I can remember and has, since its inception, raked in quite the profits and the name for itself. With such a history behind it, it's no wonder the company made it on this list as 13th in the last of the largest beverage companies by market cap. Like Brown-Forman Corporation (NYSE: BF-B), Diageo PLC (NYSE: DEO), Starbucks Coffee Company (NASDAQ: SBUX), PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP), Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO) and Keurig Dr. Pepper (NYSE: KDP), Monster is one of the most famous beverage companies in the world.12. Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NYSE: KDP)Market Capitalization: $52.35 billionAnother familiar name like Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST) is Keurig Dr. Pepper (NYSE: KDP). Being a leading company in the production and sale of hot and cold beverages to its consumers, Dr. Pepper (NYSE: KDP) is ranked 12th on the list of 15 largest beverage companies by market cap. With a revenue of $11.62 billion just last year, it is one of the oldest and most successful beverage companies in the world. LikeOakmark Global Fund, in their Q4 2020 investor letter, mentioned Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ: KDP). Here is what the fund said:\"Keurig Dr Pepper is one of North America\u2019s leading beverage companies and commands dominant positions in single-serve coffee and flavored sodas. We believe single-serve coffee pods will capture almost all of the incremental growth in at-home coffee consumption. Many consumers find that K-Cups offer better convenience, quality, variety and value, compared to drip brewing. Keurig\u2019s competitive advantages (low-cost production, the largest installed base of brewers, exclusive brand partnerships) allow it to collect a toll on most pods sold in North America. The company\u2019s soda franchises remain highly profitable, and we do not expect health-related concerns about sugar to materially impact consumption trends. We believe that Keurig\u2019s brands should deliver steady growth, consistent market share gains and significant excess cash. We think the company is an above-average business trading at a meaningful discount to the broader market, its beverage peers and historical private market transactions.\u201d11. Jiangsu Yanghe Brewery Joint-Stock Co., Ltd. (SZSE: 002304.SZ)Market Capitalization: $54.10 billionLocated in China's capital of Baijiu \u2013 Suqian, Yanghe Distillery (002304: SHE) is ranked 11th on the list of the largest beverage companies by market cap. Yet another alcohol company on the list like Constellation Brands (NYSE: STZ) and Brown Forman (NYSE: BF.B) above makes one realize the popularity of alcoholic beverages worldwide. Their website boasts of the unique and spellbinding way the company brews its drinks, and a revenue of over $3 billion in 2020 explains how it made it to this list.10. Pernod Ricard SA (EPA: RI.PA)Market Capitalization: $56.64 billionPernod Ricard (EPA: RI.PA) is a French company also producing alcoholic beverages. With revenue of \u20ac8.987 billion in 2018 and their famous Pernod Anise and Ricard Pastis, the company is ranked 10th on the list of 15 largest beverage companies by market cap. Pernod Ricard (EPA: RI.PA) is the company holding one of the most prestigious brand portfolios in this industry: Absolut Vodka.9. Nongfu Spring Co., Ltd. (HKSE: 9633.HK)Market Capitalization: $67.97 billionNongfu Spring (HKSE: 9633.HK) is another Chinese company. However, they are the producers and sellers of bottled water headquartered in Xihu District, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province. In 2019, their revenue stood at $3.4 billion, earning them the 9th spot on the list of 15 largest beverage companies by market cap. Like Brown-Forman Corporation (NYSE: BF-B), Diageo PLC (NYSE: DEO), Starbucks Coffee Company (NASDAQ: SBUX), PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP), Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO), Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST) and Keurig Dr. Pepper (NYSE: KDP), Nongfu is one of the most famous beverage companies in the world.8. Heineken N.V. (AMS: HEIA.AS)Market Capitalization: $67.97 billionYet another company specializing in brewing and selling alcoholic beverages, Heineken (AMS: HEIA.AS) stands at 8th on the list of largest beverage companies by market cap. The company is a Dutch multinational brewing company founded in 1864 and owns over 165 breweries in over 70 countries by 2017. They focus on 250 international, regional, local, and specialty beers and ciders and employ around 73,000 people. Like Brown-Forman Corporation (NYSE: BF-B), Diageo PLC (NYSE: DEO), Starbucks Coffee Company (NASDAQ: SBUX), PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP), Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO), Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST) and Keurig Dr. Pepper (NYSE: KDP), Heineken is one of the most famous beverage companies in the world.7. Diageo plc (NYSE: DEO)Market Capitalization: $112.75 billionDiageo PLC (NYSE: DEO) is a British multinational alcoholic beverage company based in London, England. Operating in over 180 countries and producing beverages in over 140 sites globally, the company falls 7th on the list of 15 largest beverage companies by market capitalization. Until 2017, Diageo (NYSE: DEO) was the world's largest distiller when it was overtaken and replaced by the Chinese Kweichow Moutai Co., Ltd. (SSE: 600519.SS). The revenue of the company stood at \u00a311.75 billion in 2020. Like Starbucks Coffee Company (NASDAQ: SBUX), PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP), Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO), Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST) and Keurig Dr. Pepper (NYSE: KDP), Diageo is one of the most famous beverage companies in the world.Weitz Investment Management, in its Q1 2021 investor letter, mentioned Diageo plc (NYSE: DEO). Here is what the fund said in its latest letter:\"We sold Diageo after twelve years of very profitable ownership. The global spirits company has done a fine job of growing earnings, and the stock has enjoyed an extra boost from substantial, multiple expansions along the way. While the business is in good hands, we think a repeat of our mid-double-digit annualized return experience is far less likely. We simply see better risk/reward profiles in the Fund\u2019s other quality holdings.\u201d6. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX)Market Capitalization: $131.71 billionEveryone must have heard of this company at least once in their lives. Starbucks Coffee Company (NASDAQ: SBUX) revolutionized the coffee market since its inception, and thus it earned a place on the list of the 15 largest beverage companies by market cap. The corporation is an American multinational chain of coffeehouses and roastery reserves based in Seattle, Washington. It is also the world's largest coffeehouse chain and symbolizes the American third wave of coffee culture. The company's revenue stood at $26.5 billion in 2019.Like Brown-Forman Corporation (NYSE: BF-B), PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP), Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO), Diageo PLC (NYSE: DEO), Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST) and Keurig Dr. Pepper (NYSE: KDP), Starbucks is one of the most famous beverage companies in the world.

            "description": "Students in a primary school in Langzhong, Southwest China's Sichuan Province wear red scarves as fresh members of Young Pioneers on Monday, a day ahead of the International Children's Day. Photo: VCGChina's child-related stocks surged on Tuesday on the A-share, Hong Kong and US markets, after the country's top leadership announced on Monday a major policy shift that allows every couple to have three children.The policy change will benefit many industries such as education, retirement, the maternity sector, clothes, infant formula, medical care and real estate, analysts noted.Ningbo David Medical Device Co, an A-share listed company that produces and sells medical equipment for infants, opened 6.72 percent higher and closed 12.47 percent higher on Tuesday. Hong Kong-listed Jinxin Fertility Group, an assisted reproductive service provider, saw its shares open 17.51 percent higher but closed 4.92 percent lower.Aidigong Maternal & Child Health closed 13.7 percent higher in Hong Kong. The company is a leading maternity service provider in China focusing on traditional yuezi (postpartum confinement), which refers to the month of resting and restoring balance after giving birth.The rally was boosted by the announcement from China's top leadership on Monday that couples are allowed to have three children as part of an effort to tackle shifting demographics in the country.Analysts said that the move will further boost the country's already massive market. According to iiMedia Research, in 2020, China's maternal and infant market reached 4.09 trillion yuan ($641.2 billion).\"The market will continue to grow after the implementation of the three-child policy, with a steady expansion of 5 percent annually in the next two years. But the growth will not be significant, as the policy still needs time to be digested,\" Zhang Yi, CEO of Guangdong-based iiMedia Research, told the Global Times on Tuesday.\"It will be evident after two years, when the consumption of toys, clothing and milk powder will post an annual growth rate of 7 percent,\" Zhang added.A manager at a Beijing-based yuezi center told the Global Times on Tuesday that after the implementation of the two-child policy, the number of customers increased a lot every year, mainly from the post-80s and post-90s mothers.\"It is expected that there will be more new customers after the three-child policy, but it will take one or two years. After all, preparing for pregnancy takes time,\" said the manager.\"This year, the number of customers hiring yuezi increased by 40 percent compared with last year. There were basically no customers in the second half of last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic,\" the manager added.A Shanghai-based analyst surnamed Cheng told the Global Times on Tuesday that the three-child policy will benefit many industries, not only those classified as maternity- and infant-related.\"A baby boom often corresponds to an increase in total social demand. China's population growth will eventually become a demographic dividend and a huge domestic market,\" Cheng added.A staffer at Guangzhou Baiyunshan Pharmaceutical Holdings Co told the Global Times on Tuesday that the company believes the policy could be a boon for its Jin'ge - a generic version of sildenafil citrate, the blockbuster drug that US-based pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc developed and marketed under the trade name Viagra.\"Obviously, the new policy will involve older parents looking to having more babies. As an anti-erectile dysfunction drug, Jin'ge could help those in need, and therefore we see the policy as a boon,\" the staffer said, noting that the company has no plans to alter its marketing practices or sales targets for the drug.The policy shift is also boosting many other sectors such as liquor. Some investors noted that E Fund's \"star manager\" Zhang Kun, put shares of Jinxin Fertility Group and liquor stocks including Kweichow Moutai and Wuliangye in a portfolio named \"Asia Selection\" in March.Some explained that Chinese customs require new parents to invite guests to celebrate the baby's birth. At these events, baijiu (a type of liquor), is indispensable. Therefore, liquor also belongs to child-related concept stocks.But analysts warned that the announcement of the three-child policy does not mean that there will be three children in each family, because the willingness to give birth won't immediately change, which means that actual demand growth will be limited.",

            "description": "A party representing Arab citizens of Israel has for the first time joined an Israeli coalition to form a government, but many doubt the move can end decades of political marginalisation.Arab Israeli Mansour Abbas, the head of the conservative Islamic Raam party, late Wednesday signed onto an eleventh-hour deal hoping to oust the country\u2019s longest-serving premier, Benjamin Netanyahu.An image of the lawmaker of Palestinian descent at a table with centrist Yair Lapid and right-wing nationalist Naftali Bennett, all three grinning, captured a historic moment and circulated widely on social media.Abbas, a member of the Knesset legislature since 2019, was jubilant on Israel\u2019s army radio on Thursday morning.\u201cWe obtained the legitimacy to influence the Israeli political system and not just to be present there in the Knesset,\u201d he said.\u201cIt opens a wide door for us to influence policies and decisions for the benefit of all citizens of the state and especially Arab citizens.\u201dIn 1992, when a peace process was underway with the Palestinians, Arab Israeli lawmakers backed a Labor coalition from the outside but did not take part in the negotiations.\u2013 \u2018Don\u2019t trust the government\u2019 \u2013Arab Israelis \u2014 descendants of Palestinians who remained on their land when the state of Israel was created in 1948 \u2014 make up around 20 percent of the Israeli population.They regularly complain of discrimination and being treated as second-class citizens.During a recent uptick in the conflict with Israel, they staged unprecedented protests in solidarity with Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank.In the run-up to the country\u2019s elections in March, the fourth in less than two years, Abbas surprised many when he said that in order to help his community, he would be prepared to work with the hawkish Netanyahu.His Raam party split from the Joint List, a grouping of Arab Israeli politicians, to run separately in the polls.But not all are happy with that decision, or with Abbas\u2019s choice to join the emerging coalition government alone.\u201cWe would have had influence if all the (Arab) parties had stayed together. We could have imposed our conditions,\u201d said Eilaf Dagher, an Arab Israeli resident of northern Israel.\u201cI don\u2019t trust the Israeli government \u2014 whether right-wing or left-wing,\u201d she said.Two other Arab Israeli parties have already accused Abbas of selling out.Joining the motley alliance \u201cgives legitimacy to a policy that denies the rights of Palestinians\u201d, the Communist Party and the Democratic Front for Peace and Equality said in a statement.They said even the prospect of toppling Netanyahu, whom the Arab Israeli community has long of accused of being racist, did not justify joining \u201ca right-wing government that does not represent a real change\u201d.\u2013 Limited influence? \u2013The terms of Wednesday\u2019s agreement are unclear, and any coalition government must still be approved by the parliament in the coming days.The deal is unlikely to have included any plan to change a 2018 law that defines Israel as the nation state of the Jewish people and only gives Jews the right to self-determination, a decision that outraged Arab Israelis.But Raam, which has four lawmakers in the 120-seat Knesset, said it had managed to secure a pledge of millions of shekels for the Arab communities, and the post of deputy speaker.Amal Jamal, a political scientist at Tel Aviv University, said Abbas appeared to believe that joining the government was a step towards gradual policy change.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time in which a political party is willing to give up on changing policies, on the principle of equality, on the national issues, and is satisfied with receiving funds,\u201d he said.But he warned that Raam\u2019s influence would likely remain limited, and the Jewish parties would retain the upper hand.When will Abbas manage to achieve change, if not at \u201cthe height of the negotiations, when they really are in desperate need for him?\u201d he asked.by Majeda al-Batsh and Claire Gounon",

            "description": "We\u2019ve all encountered baijiu somewhere \u2013 perhaps toasting at a wedding banquet, sealing a new business deal, or greeting the sunrise with the lads outside of a 7-Eleven. But with China becoming increasingly international, the question remains whether the Middle Kingdom\u2019s national liquor will find global recognition or fade into obscurity. Big baijiu is placing its bets on where and how to stay relevant in a rapidly changing market.Despite seeing massive growth in recent years, the baijiu industry is at a crossroads. Baijiu\u2019s major consumer group is over 60 years old, while the younger generation of Chinese drinkers has shown less affection to the spirit \u2013 viewing it as their father\u2019s or grandfather\u2019s drink of choice. Below, we learn how baijiu\u2019s modernity can put it on the world map.Top-heavy DrinkersIt\u2019s a Tuesday night, and we find ourselves on the third floor of Guangzhou\u2019s new 90s-style F&B mecca Super Wenheyou. The restaurant slash bar arena is probably best described as a night market with boozy characteristics.It\u2019s here that we step into Sanyou, a baijiu-focused watering hole with brick walls, black tiles, rich wood and a red lacquered cabinet that gives it a distinct stamp of China.At the helm of the brooding barroom is Head Bartender and Manager Jackwing Yao \u2013 the person who all the baijiu enthusiasts and experts have told us we need to see.She\u2019s recently returned to Guangdong\u2019s capital from a baijiu cocktail event at the W Hotel Chengdu. A modern cocktail-ready brand of baijiu, Banhai, or \u2018Half Seas Over,\u2019 flew her out as the \u2018startender\u2019 for the party. Artisanal cocktails are just one way that the baijiu industry is reinventing itself for the next generation of drinkers.We give Sanyou\u2019s baijiu negroni a try, served in a heavy iron teapot with fresh citrus and herb garnishes blooming out of the top. It\u2019s made with dongjiu, a Guizhou medicinal baijiu sealed in a clay pot for 10 years with 130 traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) botanicals.The bar at Sanyou. Image via Hope GroupPoured over a monstrous ice cube, the fresh, floral and herbaceous layers are soothing yet explosive. The cocktail is world-class, and we understand immediately why a baijiu bar like Sanyou is inspiring the game.Baijiu is the most widely produced spirit in the world, but beyond the borders of China, it is either completely unknown or painfully misunderstood. Outside China, the world\u2019s most valuable alcohol conglomerates (AB InBev, Diageo, Pernod Ricard and Constellation) have a combined value of USD296 billion as of March 2021. However, Forbes reported that China\u2019s two top distillers, Kweichow Moutai and Wuliangye, had surged in value to an astonishing USD517.2 billion.READ MORE: The Established and the Up-and-Comers in the Baijiu-verseBaijiu has a deeply rooted cultural significance, for example at government banquets, since becoming China\u2019s national drink in 1949. In 1972, Chairman Mao served baijiu to Richard Nixon to mark the first time a US president visited the PRC.Former US President Richard Nixon and Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai knocking back a couple of shots of baijiu. Image via @newalbanian/TwitterDrinking baijiu in professional settings requires a deep understanding of the \u2018toasting\u2019 ritual, where the most senior or distinguished guests drink first, with the undersized goblets drank in a descending hierarchy.An even more classical gesture is to lower one\u2019s glass and face below that of your superior, or the recipient of the toast, as a show of respect.WATCH: Everything You Need to Know About China's Drinking CultureResearch shows that Chinese consumers in the 20- to 35-year-old category are most likely to buy imported wine and liquor. Yao tells us, \u201cMany young people don\u2019t like baijiu because it\u2019s very strong and hard to drink. There are many different light-aroma and rice-aroma baijiu that are easy to drink, but young people don\u2019t know. They only know Moutai, Luzhou Laojiao and things like that.\u201dIn response, major baijiu brands are branching out and changing the recipe to attract younger customers in China. The industry is also making inroads into the global market; converting one bartender at a time.Baijiu BeginningsIntroducing baijiu to the rest of the world is not going to be easy. The clear spirit is preceded by sweeping assumptions and misguided monikers like \u2018liquid razor blades\u2019 or \u2018rice wine.\u2019 Baijiu is not wine but rather a meticulously crafted alcohol extracted from the dry or semi-dry fermentation of grains. Also, most baijiu contains no rice at all, as this represents but one specific subcategory, of which there are at least a dozen.The main four categories, aptly dubbed \u2018aromas,\u2019 are strong aroma, light aroma, sauce aroma and rice aroma. Most baijiu is made from sorghum, a grain that could be easily mistaken for quinoa.One of the defining characteristics of Chinese alcohol is qu, which refers to the agent of fermentation.Recipes for qu are closely guarded and vary wildly, but can be lumped into big qu and small qu. Big qu is a large brick of moist grain paste that is aged for months to develop a colony of bacteria, fungus and other microorganisms.Small qu is a paste of ground rice formed into small balls and coated in previously fermented small qu for use as a fermenting agent about five days later.The invention of qu is at least a thousand years old, but China\u2019s tale of alcohol goes back much, much further.Bricks of big qu being aged for bacterial colonization. Image via Ming River BaijiuIn the early 2000s, archeochemists from the University of Pennsylvania were analyzing samples from a neolithic village, Jiahu, along the Yellow River in Northern China\u2019s Henan province. Chemical analyses of ancient pottery revealed that the Jiahu villagers were busy making rice, fruit and honey wine a whopping 9,000 years ago.The proof is provided, but the recorded historical origins of alcohol in China are hazy, as are most stories involving booze. Some researchers cite historical documents, which attribute one of the original methods to Yi Di, the wife of King Yu, around 2100 BCE.According to Herbert Allen Giles, a British sinologist and diplomat stationed in China at the end of the 19th Century, a Chinese statesman named Chang Chi\u2019en is said to have brought grapes and the art of wine-making to China from the Greek Kingdom of Bactria in 126 BCE.The ritualistic consumption of baijiu is steeped in Confucian values.In book 2 of The Analects of Confucius, compiled by his disciples after his death in 479 BCE, Confucius refers to the ritual of serving wine and food to the old before the young. He also often warned not to overindulge in drinking, especially at a funeral.WATCH: Woman Downs 2 Baijiu Bottles, Floats Down YangtzeLao Tzu, the father of Taoism, appears to have had a more relaxed opinion of intoxication. Chuang Tzu, a student of Lao Tzu, expresses this wonderfully in the following quote translated by Giles: \u201cA drunken man who falls out of a cart, though he may suffer, does not die. His bones are the same as other people\u2019s; but he meets his accident in a different way. [\u2026] Ideas of life, death, fear, etc., cannot penetrate his breast; and so he does not suffer from contact with objective existences. And if such security is to be got from wine, how much more is it to be got from Tao?\u201d\u201cA drunken man who falls out of a cart, though he may suffer, does not die\u201dThe Tang Dynasty (618-906 CE) is often considered to have been a golden age for Chinese culture, and it was in this period where we encounter Li Bai. Somewhat the Hemingway of his time, Li Bai is China\u2019s favorite drunk as his poems romanticize days spent frolicking between naps, drunk off what would then have been huangjiu or actual rice wine.Here\u2019s a sample of the poet\u2019s love for drinking in \u2018Waking from Drunkenness on a Spring Day\u2019 (translated by Arthur Waley):\u201cMoved by its song I soon began to sigh, and, as wine was there, I filled my own cup. Wildly singing I waited for the moon to rise; when my song was over, all my senses had gone.\u201dLi Bai in drunken repose.

Image via WikimediaNot Your Grandpa\u2019s BaijiuThe colorful history of baijiu has failed to preserve its relevance among China\u2019s young adults. Baijiu has always been a staple of Chinese dining, and the spirit is said to pair best with the regional cuisine of its place of origin.One would be remiss not to serve baijiu at a wedding, and restaurants are sure to have at least a few brands on hand. However, one place in Chinese society where baijiu is notably absent is in the club.Nightclubs are very much a Western import to China, having emerged around the foreign concessions in the early 20th century \u2013 a time when Shanghai was referred to as the \u2018Paris of the East.\u2019We asked Alexandre Lacroix to share some insight from his many years in the Guangzhou nightclub scene. Lacroix is the CEO of IALVA, which now specializes in brand consultation and promotion, but was once Guangzhou\u2019s largest \u2018filler\u2019 agency (filling clubs with guests by giving away drinks).\u201cHaving foreign alcohol is much fancier and [clubs] can put a high price on it\u201dHe told That\u2019s that he has rarely seen baijiu in nightclubs. Instead, whiskey, vodka and sparkling wine are the most sought-after libations in Chinese clubs.Chinese rap star KeyNG performing at Space Nanjing, October 30, 2020. Image via @spaceplus_china/InstagramLacroix makes the argument that baijiu doesn\u2019t fit the clubbing mold because it\u2019s either too expensive or too cheap for clubgoers. He adds that \u201chaving foreign alcohol is much fancier and [clubs] can put a high price on it.\u201dAccording to an article published by Spirits Selection Concours Mondial de Bruxelles, China imported USD4 billion worth of spirits in 2018. French brandy dominated, including high-priced cognac and Armagnac, and amounted to nearly half of the 83 million liters of liquor that flowed over the border.Meanwhile, millennials are spending and drinking the most when it comes to alcohol in China, and baijiu brands are tweaking traditional recipes to attract the younger crowd. As many baijiu brands push the 50% ABV threshold, less potent baijiu and fruit infusions are tactics currently being put to the test.Jackwing Yao mixing up some magic with Jiangxiaobai.

They have collaborated with Japanese candy-coated breadstick brand Pocky to make a baijiu-flavored confection and work with other brands to increase exposure.READ MORE: We Tried Baijiu Flavored Pocky and it's Surprisingly GoodAs for the big-time baijiu distillers like Moutai, they\u2019re starting to invest in the younger generations.Tang Yifan, Manager of Promotions for Kweichow Moutai in Guangzhou, directed us to a hip music video that Moutai released just before the Spring Festival titled \u2018Oh, It\u2019s Moutai.\u2019The video features three young non-Chinese nationals dancing around the streets of Moutai town in Guizhou, rapping about their love of Chinese liquor.WATCH: Famous Baijiu Brand Moutai Releases Cringeworthy Rap Song\u201cThe way for baijiu to open up to young people and foreign markets is to make culture the output,\u201d Tang tells us. She believes combining elements of popular culture, like hip hop, will make the brand itself more appealing. Jiangxiaobai also sponsored a music video with Chinese rap pioneer GAI back in 2018. Watch \u2018The Flow of Jiang Hu\u2019 music video below (VPN off):Another angle being explored by big baijiu is the world of craft cocktails. Yao from Sanyou tells us one label, Baitiao, was developed by Luzhou Laojiao for the specific purpose of mixing drinks.In 2017, Baitiao organized a baijiu cocktail competition held at the China International Import Expo. Kweichow Moutai also hosted a baijiu cocktail competition in Hainan last November, to which Yao was summoned as a judge.\u201cThe way for baijiu to open up to young people and foreign markets is to make culture the output\u201dYao\u2019s previous venture, Spin, sadly succumbed to the pandemic, but she was scooped up by the great minds behind award-winning cocktail bar Hope & Sesame. Yao explains, \u201cafter me and my team left [Spin], the owners of Hope & Sesame, Andrew and Bastien, looked for me because they wanted to open a baijiu cocktail bar. I think, for me, it was a big challenge. I had made baijiu cocktails before, but I didn\u2019t study it too deeply. I have been bartending for more than 10 years so I think it is very interesting.\u201dBastien Ciocca (left) and Andrew Ho (right) from Hope & Sesame teamed up with Yao (middle) to create Sanyou. Image via Hope GroupAlthough some baijiu brands are betting on light aroma for the cocktail scene, her bar program is curated to include all 12 classifications of baijiu and showcase their unique flavors. The tasting notes for different baijiu are comically diverse, ranging from \u2018freshly sharpened pencil\u2019 to \u2018candied banana.\u2019 To a knowledgeable and creative bartender like Yao, baijiu is full of possibilities.Sanyou\u2019s most popular libation is the Moutai Milk Punch \u2013 cherry and chocolate compliment the creaminess of the baijiu, with a dash of red pepper bitters.Yao says cocktails are gaining popularity in China but admits that expats make up a big part of the Sanyou clientele. A handful of Westerners who developed a love of baijiu while living in China are taking it global.Baijiu DiplomacyIn Shanghai, Australian native James Gillespie and American RJ Steiner officially launched their bartender baijiu in April.The brand, \u767d8 (pronounced baiba), infuses eight different Chinese botanicals into the spirit.After three years of rigorous experimentation, the pair selected a light aroma baijiu as the canvas for their carefully selected blend of ingredients \u2013 Sichuan peppercorns, shiitake mushrooms, green tea and coriander, to name a few.READ MORE: Viagra found in 5,000 bottles of baijiu in LiuzhouGillespie tells That\u2019s, \u201cWe wanted to create a baijiu that younger, cosmopolitan Chinese could not only identify with but also enjoy outside of where and how baijiu was traditionally consumed \u2013 at banquets and in restaurants.\u201dEach botanical was distilled separately to build a library of over 100 samples. Despite their TCM benefits, the ingredients were chosen and blended with mixology in mind. The pair envision baijiu following in the footsteps of gin. \u201cIn the West, we are seeing something similar with gin, where consumers want more than just a \u2018London Dry\u2019 Gin that their mothers and fathers drank \u2013 which we believe has led to the explosion of \u2018craft\u2019 gins in the market currently,\u201d says Gillespie.The secret blend of herbs and spices. Image via \u767d8One long-time baijiu expert on the scene is Jim Boyce, a Canadian who currently resides in Beijing. Boyce moved to China in 2004 to work as the communications director for a chamber of commerce.His interest in the cocktail and wine scene led him to start the Beijing Boyce newsletter in 2005 and then the Grape Wall of China blog in 2007.However, his first encounter with baijiu happened earlier in 1999 when he traveled to Inner Mongolia and spent a few nights in a yurt. He noticed a couple of security guards laughing and sending explosions of baijiu up from the fire pit. Naturally, they offered Boyce a toast and he recounts thinking, \u201cIf it explodes into flame on a fire, then it\u2019s probably going to start a nice fire in my belly.\u201dBoyce would later go on to start World Baijiu Day (WBD) in 2015 \u2013 a self-described passion project that\u2019s slowly gaining steam. WBD takes place on August 9 because of the phonetic similarity of eight-nine (ba jiu) in Mandarin to baijiu. The events, mostly hosted in bars, include special Chinese food offerings and creative twists like baijiu chocolates being served alongside tasting flights and baijiu cocktails.A WBD pop-up in Beijing, circa 2015. Image via worldbaijiuday.comWBD events are held from Bangkok to Buenos Aires by baijiu enthusiasts worldwide and have never been formally sponsored. \u201cWe\u2019re never trying to get the most events. It\u2019s more just doing it with fun people. We\u2019re all like, let\u2019s do something once a year because we\u2019re all interested in the spirit,\u201d says Boyce.If there\u2019s one name synonymous with the international baijiu industry, it\u2019s Derek Sandhaus. He became somewhat of an expert on baijiu while living in China, proceeded to write two books on the subject and went on to co-found Ming River Baijiu in 2018.We spoke with Sandhaus via Skype as he was finishing breakfast at his home in Washington DC. He curated an extensive knowledge of baijiu through the best method: drinking, and has experienced the spirit from its most elegant to its most pedestrian.He recalls an early baijiu experience in Shanghai on New Year\u2019s Eve in 2007. A group of expats found a bar that would host an all-you-can-drink party for a reasonable price. Upon arrival, they realized that the bar had replaced all the imported spirits one expects to find at a Shanghai bar with baijiu and not the kind you gift to your prospective father-in-law. \u201cA total disaster,\u201d is how Sandhaus described it as the high-test liquor sent the night spiraling out of control.Sandhaus tells us, \u201cOver the next several years, I would experience baijiu in its more natural habitat. As I became more involved in [other] business ventures in China, I would be invited out to lunches in nice Chinese restaurants where baijiu would be served with the food. I would go to weddings and things like that. [However,] I still didn\u2019t have a great impression of baijiu until I started making an effort to figure out what it was that I was drinking.\u201dHe compares it to any other broad category of Chinese staples like tea or noodles \u2013 the variety is as vast as the people of China. \u201cA lot of people mistake limited experience for the vast complexity of distilled spirits that are made in China,\u201d says Sandhaus.\u201cThink of baijiu as an equivalent term to \u2018Western spirits\u2019\u201dFor those who tried baijiu and swore off it forever, he gives the following analogy. \u201cThink of baijiu as an equivalent term to \u2018Western spirits.\u2019 China is as big as continental Europe and there is as much linguistic, culinary and ethnic diversity throughout the landmass as there is in Western Europe. If you have a rough night with gin, you don\u2019t then say you aren\u2019t going to drink any spirit made in Europe... You\u2019re not going to throw out vodka and whiskey because you didn\u2019t like one of the hundreds of different things you could try.\u201dAfter Sandhaus published Baijiu: The Essential Guide to Chinese Spirits, he promoted the drink and the book by hosting informative tastings for people interested in the spirit.Derek Sandhaus educating the great unwashed about the beauty of baijiu. Image via Ming River BaijiuAt the Bookworm Literary Festival in Beijing, Sandhaus met Bill Isler. According to Sandhaus, \u201c[Isler] said that he was really impressed with the talk and learning more about baijiu. But he was most impressed, after being in China a lot longer than me, that I had a room full of young Chinese and foreigners who were drinking and enjoying baijiu.\u201d Isler suggested that baijiu be the theme for a new bar he and some friends were opening.\u201cIt\u2019s much easier to sell baijiu to people who have never tried it before\u201dBefore long, baijiu distilleries around China began to send emissaries to investigate the phenomenon of expats and Chinese people frequenting a new neighborhood baijiu bar, Capital Spirits.The concept had piqued the interest of China\u2019s baijiu business. Requests to collaborate, replicate and proliferate baijiu in this new setting began rolling in. Sandhaus, Isler and a couple of friends set about starting a consultancy to internationalize baijiu.The company was soon eclipsed by an offer from China\u2019s oldest continuously operational distillery, Luzhou Laojiao. Despite boasting a fermentation pit from 1573, Luzhou Laojiao knew that they needed fresh perspectives to launch an international label. After two years of developing the product, Ming River Baijiu launched in 2018.Unlike some Chinese distilleries that have released low alcohol, fruit-infused versions to appeal to younger drinkers, Ming River is an authentic and traditional strong aroma baijiu. Fast forward to 2021, and Ming River sells in 25 states across America, one province in Canada and several countries in Europe.READ MORE: We Tried Peach and Apple Baijiu and It Tastes like CandySandhaus says that misunderstanding is the biggest obstacle that baijiu faces internationally, and through education, he aims to enlighten the uninitiated masses.He tells us, \u201cIt\u2019s much easier to sell baijiu to people who have never tried it before than to people who were introduced to it in a more aggressive, ganbei binge drinking setting in China.\u201dSandhaus\u2019 second baijiu book, Drunk In China, provides a detailed account of his first-hand investigation of such sessions. \u201cWhen you sit down with someone who hasn\u2019t had baijiu before, you explain to them exactly what it is, how its made, what kind of flavors the distiller is trying to get in that product, and what the differences between different styles of baijiu are \u2013 and then you serve them a few of those different styles\u2026it\u2019s a much softer landing.\u201dREAD MORE: Derek Sandhaus on Being Drunk in ChinaSurely baijiu will always have a home in China, but can it expand its scope to the bars in Lagos, London and Las Vegas?It remains to be seen if baijiu will ever commonly be found on the shelf alongside vodka and tequila \u2013 spirits that have risen to global dominance. Maybe, baijiu is just too late, and the party\u2019s already poppin\u2019.Nonetheless, the wheels are already in motion, and big baijiu certainly has the capital to reinvest. Such a diverse array of styles and flavors is sure to find a niche in the ever-evolving cocktail culture, at the very least.[Cover image via Ming River Baijiu]",

The new expression was launched at a celebratory event on 22 April at Club 55, described as the \u2018it\u2019 venue in Shanghai.Sixty guests were welcomed onto a red carpet entrance before witnessing the unveiling of Shede Founder\u2019s Tribute, a unique Strong Aroma Baijiu co-developed by Camus and Shede \u2013 described as two brands of different geographic origin but with a shared passion for quality and craftsmanship.Shede Founder\u2019s Tribute is expected to be on-shelf in the latter half of 2021.Camus President Cyril Camus and Shede Spirits CEO and Vice Chairman of the Board Pu Jizhou co-hosted the elegant affair. Special guests included consuls and other representatives from the Egypt and France consulates, representatives from international companies, Chinese government leaders from the spirits and free trade zone sectors, and celebrities from the world of arts & academia. Both hosts made speeches before the product reveal to signal the historic moment.Camus is also helping Shede to develop its reach in international domestic duty paid markets, with the French local market and EU ecommerce leading the way. Recently, Taste Shede, the brand\u2019s flagship product in duty paid markets, was launched on Amazon within the EU.\u201cThis collaboration has shown Camus\u2019 determination to further build baijiu\u2019s impact in the international market, duty free and duty paid.

Shede Founder\u2019s Tribute is made adhering to the highest quality standard of \u2018vintage spirits\u2019, fermented in the ancient way in Shede\u2019s oldest pits from the Ming dynasty, then kick-started with Qu (a fermentation starter) following the #1000-Year Classical Tai He\u2019 method.The base spirit is aged for a minimum of six years and blended with 15 years-old vintage baijiu from the Tai\u2019An workshop. \u201cThe traditional craftsmanship is blended with artistry and inspiration, sparking youthful charm in a vintage spirit, one destined to bring new experience beyond our imagination,\u201d said Camus of the new launch.The celebratory evening marks the start of the internationalisation journey of China Strong Aroma Baijiu, led by Shede, Camus said. The company vowed to \u201cspread the aroma of baijiu around the world\u201d through the promotion and integration of Chinese and Western culture.Kindred spiritsCyril Camus visit to Shede\u2019s ecological park in 2018 confirmed his intuition that the brand had the potential to be an international hit.Shede has unique brand genes that appeals to a wide range of demographic groups beyond the Chinese, he believes. Shede\u2019s association with widely known Eastern philosophies (Confucianism, Buddhism and Daoism); a minimalistic design that encompasses classic Chinese flair (embracing a calligraphy brand logo and the Yin & Yang colour scheme); and lastly, a shared understanding of the \u2018sacrifice to gain\u2019 (the literal translation of the brand name \u201cShede\u201d) concept with consumers.The final point has been reinforced by Shede\u2019s decision to collaborate with great artists, writers and sportsmen, all of whom endured sacrifice to be successful.Founder\u2019s Tribute, the international debut of Shede, pays tribute to the long tradition of the Tai\u2019An Workshop, harmoniously blending its Chinese heritage with a modernist Yin Yang design.Duty free-exclusive Founder\u2019s Tribute \u201cupholds the spirit of craftsmanship and the motto of sacrifice, destined to be appreciated by the connoisseur searching for the finer things in life,\u201d Camus said.The Camus-led Spirit of China range, a duty free and travel retail-exclusive concept, only collaborates with premium Chinese Baijiu brands with a storied past, inherited craftsmanship and irreplicable brewing resources, Camus said.Spirit of China is designed to be consumers\u2019 first choice when buying baijiu and the travel retail reference in the category. It allows travellers to experience Chinese culture through a curated collection of China\u2019s finest Baijiu, Camus said.Spirit of China can be translated as both \u2018Chinese spirit\u2019 and \u2018national liquor\u201d in Chinese. The meaning of this play on words is signified in the Chinese character \u56fd(guo) within the brand\u2019s logo.The symbolic and auspicious logo is outlined in a red, minimalist, cloud pattern to add a traditional and festive connotation.By focusing on the product packaging design, consumers can learn from traditional Chinese culture and are able to reinterpret Chinese elements through modern, light, luxurious styles. The merchandising with its dual theme colours of red and gold stands out on the shop floor and exudes warm wishes to consumers related to their prosperity.Camus and the continuous quest to uncover the \u2018Spirit of China\u2019 Cyril Camus was living in China in the mid-1990s when he first became acquainted with and fascinated by baijiu. Convinced of the category\u2019s potential in the international duty free channel, he brought the leading baijiu brand Kweichow Moutai into the space and launched a collection of exclusive products that are now available to international travellers in 400+ stores in 50 countries After more than a decade of successful collaboration with Kweichow Moutai, which made Baijiu a must-have category for the travel retail channel, Camus realised consumers\u2019 continuous interest in the category and in seeking out new baijiu brands with different flavour profiles and price points compared to the ultra-premium Moutai. Camus created a specialty concept under the overarching brand \u2018Spirit of China\u2019 to further spread the aroma of baijiu around the world. Shede, a leader in Strong Aroma Baijiu (Kweichow Moutai is Sauce Aroma Baijiu) became the first brand selected by Camus to be launched under the Spirit of China. Camus said that it chose Shede for its strength in vintage reserves, ecological focus and its brand positioning as a symbol for Chinese culture.ABOUT SHEDEAs one of the top five baijiu brands in the premium category (RSP range US$50-120), Shede Spirits has an estimated brand value of RMB108 billion (US$16.7 billion). Its production adheres to the motto \u2018Sacrifice to Gain\u2019, based on a mission to deliver every bottle aged to perfection.The company boasts the world\u2019s largest inventory of aged premium baijiu, fulfilling its commitment of \u2018Every bottle aged to perfection\u2019. Shede is also fully committed to Corporate Social Responsibility, producing its baijiu in a meticulously maintained ecology park. One of the oldest liquor-making workshops in China, Tai\u2019An workshop, credited as a culinary heritage of China, is situated within the park.ABOUT CAMUSFounded in 1863, Camus is the largest family-run, independent Cognac house, owned and operated by the Camus family for five generations.Under the leadership of Cyril Camus, the House of Camus now employs people across eight countries and three continents and has subsidiaries in China and the US, as well as sales representation offices in Russia, China and China\u2019s Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong.Camus Wines & Spirits is an international independent distributor of a wide variety of premium third-party wines & spirits brands such as Loudenne wines and Lambay Irish Whiskey.

            "description": "No matter how much you enjoy eating or something, at some point, you need to call it quits. The saying that everything in moderation is good for you isn\u2019t just a saying and applies to the amount of coffee we consume. The average person takes in about 3-5 cups of coffee a day which can still be considered an acceptable amount to consume without damaging your body, but how much is too much?Water IntakeHumans need to consume at least eight glasses of water a day to flush out all the toxins and to keep the nutrients and vitamins we eat going to all the right places. Water also helios with your digestive system, and without it, our bodies are sure to shut down. The human body creates many toxins in almost every major organ, and drinking water regularly helps these toxins be flushed out. 3-5 cups of coffee a day contains roughly 1.25 litres of water per average 250ml cup, making up half of the water you need to consume for the day. As a bonus, coffee also helps the liver and kidneys to filter out the toxins a little faster, so having a few cups are not just enjoyable but also a little immune boost.Organic AssistanceAs mentioned before, coffee helps the body to function at its best. Whether you choose to drink decaf, green or ordinary coffee, your body will still benefit from the nutrients in the beans themselves. Here is a quick look at the organs that coffee assists:Heart \u2013 Coffee helps to lower your risk of a stroke or coronary heart disease by working on enzymes that stimulate the heart\u2019s contractions.\u2013 Coffee helps to lower your risk of a stroke or coronary heart disease by working on enzymes that stimulate the heart\u2019s contractions. Liver \u2013 Caffeine can help slow down fatty liver tissue growth that can cause liver disease or Hepatitis C.\u2013 Caffeine can help slow down fatty liver tissue growth that can cause liver disease or Hepatitis C. Brain function \u2013 Caffeine can give your body an adrenaline boost, decreasing fatigue and increasing memory function and reflexes. Caffeine blocks the inhibitory neurotransmitter adenosine and helps fight the early signs of Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease.Weight LossCaffeine is a good weight loss booster for anyone who wants to lose weight the right way. Most diets include caffeine because of its natural ability to boost your adrenaline and give your body energy by boosting your metabolism. You will need to consider cutting down on your sugar and exchanging your full cream for low-fat milk or even having it black to be effective. The caffeine will reduce the internal inflammation and help you keep some of those hunger pains and cravings at bay. There are also many vitamins in coffee that can help you build muscle and repair some of your body\u2019s damage during exercise.One of the most effective weight loss coffee recipes is bulletproof coffee. It\u2019s made with coffee, coconut oil and ghee and acts as a meal replacement when you are on a high protein diet. It\u2019s been all the talk about keto diets and should effectively reduce kilograms if you drink first thing in the morning on an empty stomach. You can continue to drink an additional 3 or 4 cups of coffee because this recipe doesn\u2019t affect your intake at all. The keto diet insists that you take in extra coffee to boost your metabolism, so you can continue to enjoy it without concern.Nutrients and mineralsDrinking enough coffee can help you make up your daily intake amount of certain nutrients and minerals. Coffee beans are plant-based, and even after the beans have been roasted for consumption, they are excellent for delivering the following benefits:Vitamin B2 helps to break down carbohydrates and maintain the body\u2019s energy supply.Vitamin B5 helps fight skin allergies and inflammation like acne and assists with the speedy recovery of infection.Potassium: reduces inflammation in the heart and helps to balance out the fluid in your body. High blood pressure can cause water retention, and potassium can reduce the side effects.Magnesium acts as a natural mood enhancer and helps to fight depression and keep headaches and migraines away.Fighting cancerCancer is one of the illnesses that we hear about too often, and anything that we can do to reduce the risks, we should do. Uncontrolled growth in our cells can lead to various types of cancer, but adding enough coffee to our diets can reduce the risks and slow down the possibility of early development. Drinking 4-5 cups of coffee a day can lessen these liver and colon cancer risks thanks to the antioxidants in coffee beans.Consider adding more coffee to your day, but moderate the intake with enough water and fresh fruit and vegetables. A great way to always have good coffee around is to invest in a monthly coffee subscription. You will be able to select between decaf and caffeinated, and you can alternate according to the time of the day. Even though having coffee at night puts your sleep at risk, a cup of decaf won\u2019t. Our bodies could use the boost, so let\u2019s give it a healthy one.",

            "description": "The window of a Titoni watch shop in Geneva, Switzerland Photo: VCGLuxury Swiss watchmakers, usually not big fans of online retailing, are launching a new all-digital Watches & Wonders event on Wednesday to show off their latest products, hoping to revive sales hit by the coronavirus crisis.Makers of high-end watches still largely rely on physical stores for sales, but the success of online platforms for pre-owned watches, such as WatchBox or Richemont's Watchfinder, have shown it is possible to sell luxury timepieces online.Pandemic-related factory and store closures hit Swiss watch sales last year and have forced brands to boost their often tiny online business and generally rethink digital activities.Guillaume de Seynes, executive vice president at luxury goods group Hermes, told Reuters one of the reasons Hermes' watch business outperformed the industry last year was that its customers were already used to shopping on hermes.com.Hermes, known for leather goods, silk scarves and perfumes, embraced e-commerce much earlier than pure-play watchmakers, launching its transactional website in the United States almost 20 years ago.De Seynes said he expected a strong recovery in the group's watch sales this year, with current trends broadly in line with the 28 percent increase in the final quarter of 2020.Rene Weber, analyst at Vontobel, estimated that for the Swiss watch industry about 2 percent of sales in value terms were currently done online, but that the online share varied depending on the brand. Other analysts estimated the online share of sales at around 7 percent to 9 percent.Most Swiss luxury watch brands - such as Patek Philippe and Rolex - have preferred to stick with traditional bricks and mortar stores to sell their products that can cost tens of thousands of dollars.For Patek, selling online is still not an option, and a test run with retailers during the first lockdown confirmed that strategy, President Thierry Stern told Reuters.\"People don't want to buy a Patek online, the watches are expensive, you lose the beauty, the magic.\"The family-owned luxury watchmaker sees a recovery this year after a 20 percent sales slump in 2020, but does not expect to return to 2019 sales figures yet. \"That will maybe take a year or two, Stern said.The brand has made some investment in its digital capabilities, hiring staff and setting up a studio to deliver high-quality virtual product presentations.Small independent brand H. Moser & Cie also invested in digital technology ahead of the Watches & Wonders fair and said it was pleased these costs were lower than for physical watch fairs.Watches & Wonders' official platform describes itself as \"the biggest watch event ever to take place online\", will give media and retailers access to presentations held by the 38 participating brands.\"It would be good if consumers could also participate via the Watches & Wonders platform,\" Oris Co-Chief Executive Rolf Studer told Reuters.He said Oris had found other ways to connect more closely with its clients during the pandemic, citing a campaign relating the stories of local heroes on Instagram last year or a watch launch directly to its online community via Zoom.The window of a Titoni watch shop in Geneva, Switzerland Photo: VCGLast year, luxury watchmakers Bulgari and Breitling and a handful of Swiss brands gathered in Geneva in August for a scaled-down industry exhibition, braving the coronavirus pandemic to try to revitalize demand.The big Swiss watch fairs in Basel and Geneva, which usually attract thousands of visitors, were cancelled earlier this year because of the virus.The gathering, the first of what was known as \"Geneva Watch Days\", was very different. Instead of using a big exhibition center, the event was spread over a number of the city's luxury hotels.Jean-Christophe Babin, the boss of Bulgari, who devised the new format to help to \"rekindle the flame\", said the new setting along with strict hygiene rules would help to prevent infection.\"It is important to physically meet our customers,\" Babin told Reuters in a phone interview. \"We hope the event will help us gain market share. This is sending a strong signal that we are determined to grow whatever happens.\"",

            "description": "Warren Buffett never mentions this but he is one of the first hedge fund managers who unlocked the secrets of successful stock market investing. He launched his hedge fund in 1956 with $105,100 in seed capital. Back then they weren\u2019t called hedge funds, they were called \u201cpartnerships\u201d. Warren Buffett took 25% of all returns in excess of 6 percent.For example S&P 500 Index returned 43.4% in 1958. If Warren Buffett\u2019s hedge fund didn\u2019t generate any outperformance (i.e. secretly invested like a closet index fund), Warren Buffett would have pocketed a quarter of the 37.4% excess return. That would have been 9.35% in hedge fund \u201cfees\u201d.Actually Warren Buffett failed to beat the S&P 500 Index in 1958, returned only 40.9% and pocketed 8.7 percentage of it as \u201cfees\u201d. His investors didn\u2019t mind that he underperformed the market in 1958 because he beat the market by a large margin in 1957. That year Buffett\u2019s hedge fund returned 10.4% and Buffett took only 1.1 percentage points of that as \u201cfees\u201d. S&P 500 Index lost 10.8% in 1957, so Buffett\u2019s investors actually thrilled to beat the market by 20.1 percentage points in 1957.Between 1957 and 1966 Warren Buffett\u2019s hedge fund returned 23.5% annually after deducting Warren Buffett\u2019s 5.5 percentage point annual fees. S&P 500 Index generated an average annual compounded return of only 9.2% during the same 10-year period. An investor who invested $10,000 in Warren Buffett\u2019s hedge fund at the beginning of 1957 saw his capital turn into $103,000 before fees and $64,100 after fees (this means Warren Buffett made more than $36,000 in fees from this investor).As you can guess, Warren Buffett\u2019s #1 wealth building strategy is to generate high returns in the 20% to 30% range.We see several investors trying to strike it rich in options market by risking their entire savings.

Photo: VCGAs the stock price of Chinese top liquor brand Kweichow Moutai has kept on the wane in the past few trading days, a prominent Chinese economist called for a price increase for the brand so it gradually become a luxury liquor brand to compete with other liquor brands on the global market.Since the supply of Kweichow Moutai has always been short, it's better to let the market to regulate its selling prices, for example, to double the price in overseas markets, Chinese economist Ren Zeping said during a seminar about Moutai on March 12.Ren believes Kweichow Moutai is one of the brands that have the potential to be a world-class luxury liquor brand. And one of the major sources of the disputes about the brand is its market positioning: to be a high-end liquor brand or to cap its price so more ordinary people can afford it.\"Chinese people are the major force of buying luxury products, but China doesn't have world class luxury liquor brand,\" Ren said, adding that \"Moutai's quality and culture is suitable to be a high-end brand in the world\".Moutai has been capping its price. For example, the price of Flying Fairy (Feitian) series, has been set for 1,499 yuan ($230) per bottle. The market price for Feitian series has exceed 2,000 yuan or more for a long time due to a supply shortage.\"The continued increase of its market price is a result of market rules. Under the rules, the market price is subject to supply-demand relation. It's useless and unnecessary to cap the price,\" Ren said.Kweichow Moutai's social responsibility should not be limited to be \"making the brand affordable for everyone,\" because it's neither in line with economic rules nor realistic. Instead, its responsibility should be reflected on its contribution on handing in tax revenue, providing jobs and aiding poverty alleviation, Ren said.\"From the economic point of view, the price increase could be taken as a taxation - to levy on richer people and help those who are left behind, which could be beneficial for balancing income gap,\" Ren said.Ren's comments were strongly echoed by Chinese netizens with some saying China's liquor deserves a place on the world stage, and let the market to decide the price.A WeChat user surnamed Gu said that a country's rejuvenation should include its culture, and Kweichow Moutai is a symbol of Chinese culture's rejuvenation.Global Times",

            "description": "On a fan community page on Chinese social media platform Weibo, hundreds of users have posted comments and pictures, some covered in little red hearts, to express their admiration for a star they affectionately call Kun Kun.\u201cKun Kun flies bravely, iKun will always follow him; Kun Kun never gets old, and will remain a blue-chip till the end,\u201d some users wrote alongside the picture.Advertisement\u201cKun Kun,\u201d whose full name is Zhang Kun, is neither a pop star nor actor. Instead, he is one of China\u2019s most prominent fund managers who oversees around 120 billion yuan ($18.6 billion) in assets at E Fund Management, an established Chinese asset management firm. Zhang\u2019s followers, who label themselves \u201ciKun,\u201d (\u201ci\u201d is a homophone for the Chinese word love), have also created accounts on Weibo posing as his \u201cglobal fan clubs.\u201d\u201cKun Kun, I would like to accompany you for many, many years,\u201d a follower wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s witness both the bull and bear markets, but still return with young hearts.\u201dWelcome to the gamification of China\u2019s booming mutual fund market.AdvertisementAs the country\u2019s millennial and Gen Z generations come of age as investors, they\u2019re bringing online fan culture to the usually rather staid world of investment. Just as superfans obsess over pop idols or initiate campaigns to propel beloved stars to even greater heights of fame, top fund managers like Zhang are being worshipped like celebrities. To be sure, fund fans\u2019 admiration is mostly a joking way to express happiness over their returns. But the surging online activity around managers and their products is a reflection of the generation\u2019s burning desire to invest\u2014the oldest Gen Z members are in their early 20s and in their first jobs\u2014and its potential to be a strong force in the country\u2019s capital markets.Young investors have also built fan pages for other star managers like Cai Haosong from Lion Fund Management and Ge Lan from Zhong Ou Asset Management, while one fund-focused news outlet is carrying out a poll asking users to select one of six male fund managers to be their \u201cPrince Charming.\u201d (Spoiler alert: Zhang and a colleague got the most votes.) The interest in the managers reached such a level that some funds have even received and rejected invitations from a popular Chinese entertainment show to interview their star managers, according to financial news outlet National Business Daily.This landscape poses a fresh challenge for many foreign asset managers, including giants like BlackRock and Vanguard, who have been looking to expand in China since restrictions on foreign ownership of fund management companies were scrapped earlier last year, and who have little experience of China\u2019s meme-driven online fan culture.\u201cForeign groups coming in [China] are not adapting, or not at the level or extent that they need to be competitive. [They need to] look at what Chinese competitors do, and copy it,\u201d said Peter Alexander, founder of Z-Ben, a Shanghai-based asset management consultancy.AdvertisementYoung investorsOverall, China\u2019s mutual fund assets jumped from $2.3 trillion in 2019 to $3 trillion last year, the biggest increase in five years, according to China\u2019s Asset Management Association, and the industry\u2019s profits grew by 70% to a record $309 billion last year compared to 2019. One major reason for the strong demand for funds is due to the bullish performance of China\u2019s stock markets which were buoyed by bored citizens who became day traders last year.But the size of China\u2019s fund market still lags far behind the around $22 trillion held by funds in the US, the world\u2019s largest mutual fund market. This is because China\u2019s fund industry has a much shorter history than that in the US, which launched its first fund in 1924 while it wasn\u2019t until 1998 (link in Chinese) for China to see its first mutual fund firms. Swiss bank UBS has predicted that the country could see this market grow to $16 trillion by 2030.It\u2019s likely that a large portion of the recent increase in Chinese mutual funds\u2019 assets can be attributed to younger investors\u2014people born since 1980 make up about 40% of the population. More than half of the 20 million new fund investors as of August last year in China were under the age of 30, according to a report (link in Chinese) by Shanghai-based Mob Tech, a research firm. In general, these investors prefer funds to stocks and properties, according to a report (link in Chinese) released in January on the behavior of Chinese stock investors by Tencent Securities, a financial news portal under the namesake tech giant.Advertisement\u201cWe do see a growing interest among young users in fund investment on Alipay. In 2020, over 50% of new fund investors on our platform were born after 1990,\u201d Liang Jingrui, vice general manager in charge of fund partnership at Ant Group, which owns China\u2019s dominant mobile payment app Alipay that brokers financial products, told Quartz. On average, China\u2019s Gen Z start investing two years after they start working, compared to 10 years for their parents\u2019 generation, according to a 2019 report (link in Chinese) by Alipay and China Institute of New Economy, and Liang said over 60% of the young investors held their position in the funds for more than one year in 2020.One of the reasons for youngsters to choose funds is because it is a \u201ccheaper way\u201d to have exposure to stocks, especially expensive ones, according to Alexander of Z-Ben.\u201cRather than spending hundreds if not thousands of yuan to buy stocks like [alcohol maker]Kweichow Moutai, you can buy funds [that have invested in the company] with one yuan,\u201d he told Quartz. Moutai, the most valuable stock listed in mainland China, has a stock price that\u2019s around now $331, and is a key component of the portfolios of several mutual funds, including two managed by Zhang.And because of the mobile payments revolution, it\u2019s pretty simple for people to put money into funds, wrote Chinese financial blogger Song Jianwei. Unlike their parents who could only purchase funds through banks, anyone can now do so with a few clicks on online platforms, which also provide information on different products and offer transaction fees that are lower than banks, Song wrote.AdvertisementAlipay, especially, has become an essential platform for younger adults to manage their finances.\u201cIn previous years I mostly deposited my money with banks while just spending the rest of it. But around three years ago, I started noticing that there are so many investment options on Alipay, which has lowered the threshold for investing,\u201dsaid Beijing-based Echo Kou. For many people like Kou, Alipay\u2019s money market fund Yu\u2019e Bao, which allows individuals to put in as little as $0.15 is the beginning of their investment journey. Yu\u2019e Bao now has over 600 million users, compared to over 1 billion for Alipay in China.For 29-year-old Charlene Cong, funds offer a way to diversify from her other investments. \u201cI am a believer in professional investment management, and I trust the ability of active fund managers, who can generate excess return in a market rally and mitigate risks in a market downturn,\u201d she said. Cong has allocated 40% of her money on funds, 30% in insurance, and the rest in stocks.The fandom investors display toward asset managers, naturally, is a reflection of their fund performance\u2014one of Zhang\u2019s funds delivered nearly 700% returns over eight years. Although Zhang has maintained a low profile despite the interest in him, some managers and their companies have responded to the interest by using social media to engage with new investors. For example, many have started introducing new funds in online live streams that give viewers access to purchase the products directly from their phones.AdvertisementFresh leek?Even during China\u2019s most important family holiday this year\u2014Lunar New Year eve, when families get together for a big meal\u2014over 600,000 people (link in Chinese) watched finance-related live streams on Alipay. The frenzy around investing has even extended to non-finance platforms like video streaming website Bilibili, where some make-up vloggers have begun making videos talking about their investment experiences.\u201cI bought my first fund recently because it was so trending that I could even see people talk about it on lifestyle apps,\u201d said Xiao Wei Huhu, a blogger and university student in a vlog.Several commenters praised her for taking charge of her personal finances at a young age. But some worry whether this the investing social media space, and the obsession with finance influencers and star managers, could lead to irrational herd investment decisions.Ran Cai Jing, a Chinese financial media outlet, compared Gen Z investors to \u201cleeks waiting to be harvested\u201d by finance bloggers, some of whom charge fund investors for joining fan groups they run. Since leeks grow quickly and can be harvested repeatedly, it\u2019s become slang used to reference investors without sufficient financial knowledge who can easily be drawn into speculative trading.Advertisement\u201cIf youngsters don\u2019t study the companies, industries, and products and only chase returns or short-term trends, then funds could also disappoint them one day,\u201d the outlet wrote in a recent article about the frenzy in mutual funds.",

We\u2019re anxious, depressed, stuck at home \u2014 and increasingly able to get beer, wine, spirits, and even pre-made cocktails delivered to our door.

            "description": "By John Welling, Director, Equity Indices, S&P Dow Jones IndicesAs China\u2019s economy matures, consumption and service-related industries are becoming structurally more important. Because the country\u2019s stock market continues to have significant exposure to \u201cold economy\u201d sectors, many market participants are seeking alternative index solutions to participate more directly in China\u2019s fastest growing areas.Launched in September 2016, the S&P New China Sectors Index provides access to Chinese companies operating in specific industries poised to benefit from the country\u2019s transition to a consumer- and service-oriented economy. The index includes all Chinese share classes, including A-shares and offshore listings (including those listed in the U.S.), as well as companies with a Hong Kong domicile. To distribute exposure more evenly and improve liquidity, 10% single stock caps are applied semiannually, and selection is limited to large and liquid stocks.This focus on \u201cnew China\u201d provides substantial relief from slower growing sectors of the economy, which retain a high exposure within existing, widely used Chinese equity benchmarks, such as the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI).Slower growth among these \u201cold economy\u201d sectors has translated into lagging equity performance, particularly in recent years. Over the latest five-year period, the S&P New China Sectors Index has returned more than 25.3% per year, while the HSCEI has returned only 10.8%\u2014an outperformance that speaks to the powerful driving forces of the more surgent economic sectors.What Has Driven the Outperformance?Analysis of top contributors shows that outperformance was spread out widely, with tech-giants Alibaba and Tencent contributing most toward outperformance, while Kweichow Moutai and Meituan Dianping further illustrated the importance of the rising consumer. The top 10 contributors accounted for just under half of the outperformance of the S&P New China Sectors Index versus the broad-based S&P China 500 over the most recent five-year period.Industry attribution, meanwhile, shows that outperformance was concentrated largely within the \u201cnew economy\u201d sectors. This outcome is even more apparent when compared with the HSCEI, in large part due to its greater concentration in banks and other \u201cold economy\u201d industries.By focusing on consumer- and service-related companies, the S&P New China Sectors Index offers a high level of differentiation from traditional Chinese equity benchmarks and more directly measures one of the key megatrends affecting the Chinese economy.For further information, refer to our Talking Points overview of the S&P New China Sectors Index.Originally published by Indexology, 2/19/21The posts on this blog are opinions, not advice.

It kinda tastes like tequila, but it's, like, hella strong.\" I need to find the Leo, now!Moutai is a traditional Chinese liquor with a 2,000-year history.

            "description": "In this article, we are going to talk about the 15 Most Valuable Asian Companies. You can skip our detailed discussion about the Asian economy and go to 5 Most Valuable Asian Companies.The Asian Tiger is rising. The Earth\u2019s largest and most populous continent is becoming a hub of the global economic activity, and major powers are making a \u201cpivot to Asia.\u201d A McKinsey report predicts that by 2040, Asia could account for over half of the global GDP and 40% of global consumption. The report said that the \u201cnext phase of globalization\u201d will unfold in Asia amid endless opportunities. Back in 2000, Asia accounted for just 32% of the global GDP. That share soared to 42% in 2017 and is set to touch 52% by 2040. The sheer speed of growth in major Asian economies is baffling for developed countries. The report said that Europe's share in global GDP fell to 22% in 2017.The coronavirus took its toll on the Asian economy, but a recovery in on the horizon. A 2020 ADB forecast said that the economy of the developing countries in Asia including India, Singapore, and the Philippines will contract 0.7% on the gross domestic product (GDP) and three-fourths of the region's economies are set to register negative growth for the year. China is the only country that is projected to register positive growth.Asian Economies: Post-COVID ReboundGrowth is likely to bounce back in 2021, with developing Asia expected to grow by 6.8% according to ADB. By the last quarter of 2020, China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, was expanding at a faster rate than before the crisis. After expanding at an annual rate of 4.9% in the third quarter, China's growth soared to 6.5% in the fourth quarter. According to Guardian, an analysis of GDP figures had shown that industrial production stayed intact in December, growing at an annual rate of 7.3%, but the growth in retail sales decreased from 5% to 4.6%. Japan posted annual growth of 12.7% from October to December 2020, exceeding the market forecast of a 9.5% gain. Private consumption, which accounts for more than half of the economy, increased by 2.2%. The global turnaround in manufacturing activity has also given a much-needed boost to exports and capital expenditure. According to GlobalData , Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia are projected to register positive GDP growth rates in 2021 as trade and gradual recovery in construction and tourism sectors are rising at a stable rate.Story continuesDiversified Asian IndustryThe Asian economy boasts diversified industries mainly based on agriculture and minerals. In the post-war era, industrialization and high technology innovation have transformed Asia\u2019s economy. Asia is also one of the most preferred regions for service-based industries such as outsourcing, IT, and finance. According to Statista , Asia is a hub for the leading financial centers including Tokyo, Shanghai, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Beijing.Asia\u2019s Digital RevolutionAsia is not far behind the world\u2019s digital revolution. Asia\u2019s most valuable companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu are among the top players in the tech and cloud computing industry. According to the World Intellectual Property Organization , China, Japan, and South Korea are the leading countries with the highest number of AI patent filings. Japanese consumer companies held the largest AI-published patent applications from Toshiba, NEC, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Panasonic, and Canon. Singapore on the other hand is believed to be the land of the most successful start-ups, such as Sea Ltd. (Garena) (NYSE: SE). India has also increased its AI workforce from 40,000 in 2018 to 72,000 in 2019. Pakistan is also another young and rapidly-growing Asian market, with an increasing engagement in deep-tech nurturing. Pakistan was ranked the fastest-growing country in Asia for digital freelancers in 2019.To give you the most accurate insights into the most valuable Asian companies, we ranked the most innovative companies in the region based on their market cap.

            "description": "NewsBy Christian SmithVineyard owners are increasingly keen to be promoted by so-called \u2018wine influencers\u2019 \u2013 in an indication that the pulling power of social media is beginning to appeal to wine makers.Just a few years ago, the concept of wine makers being interested in featuring on well-followed social media accounts might have seemed relatively alien. However, a new report from the Times is shedding light on an increasingly popular phenomenon for the industry, as what the publication described as a \u201cnew wave of vintage bloggers\u201d burst onto the scene.Influencer Margot Ducancel told the Times that she was previously met with bemusement when she approached wine makers to ask if they would be interested in appearing on her account. \u201cThey didn\u2019t understand what it was all about,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was quite a lot of hostility.\u201dNow though, vineyard owners appear keen to be promoted by wine influencers, whose reach often extends beyond traditional spheres of wine connoisseurs.Laura Bounie, head of press relations at PR agency Sowine explained that the industry had taken some time to come round to the notion of social media\u2019s influence in the wine trade.\u201cIt is quite conservative,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when they saw the rise of influencers in other areas, they realised they had to use them as well.\u201dBounie said that part of the appeal of this new wave of wine influencers lies in their ability to connect with audiences using simple language that makes sense to their followers.\u201cNeophytes can follow them because their language is very simple and that helps to popularise wine,\u201d she explained. Traditional critics, she continued, have a tendency to use terminology that \u201ccan make a glass of wine seem very complicated\u201d.Margot Ducancel, a 33-year-old influencer added further weight to this theory, saying \u201cI consider myself to be an enlightened amateur who will talk about wine in an accessible way rather than an expert.\u201dLaura Bounie said that her client list, which ranges from individual ch\u00e2teaux to professional bodies, were now prepared to pay anywhere between a few hundred and a few thousand euros to feature on an influencers\u2019 profile. The fee, of course, is dependent on statistics such as follower numbers, engagement rates and other metrics.",

            "description": "Moutai | Divulga\u00e7\u00e3oH\u00e1 muitas lendas em torno do Moutai, a aguardente de luxo da China. A mais famosa \u00e9 que os soldados do Ex\u00e9rcito revolucion\u00e1rio comunista liderados por Mao Ts\u00e9-tung teriam usado a bebida como desinfetante em seus ferimentos. Do campo de batalha at\u00e9 a mesa dos poderosos de hoje, o destilado \u00e9 um s\u00edmbolo da trajet\u00f3ria da China nas \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas, e seu fabricante tornou-se a empresa com maior valor de mercado da China fora do setor de tecnologia, avaliada em nada menos que meio trilh\u00e3o de d\u00f3lares.No ano passado, as a\u00e7\u00f5es da empresa Kweichow Moutai subiram quase 70% na bolsa de Xangai, um desempenho espetacular e o exemplo mais vis\u00edvel da euforia do mercado de a\u00e7\u00f5es da China \u2014 mas tamb\u00e9m dos riscos de uma bolha, como a que estourou em 2015. Na \u00e9poca, quedas acentuadas na bolsa de Xangai espalharam p\u00e2nico nos mercados de a\u00e7\u00f5es ao redor do mundo, gerando temores sobre a economia chinesa e os riscos de uma nova crise financeira global. O governo chin\u00eas teve que intervir para estancar a sangria.Coronav\u00edrus: Por que a China n\u00e3o tem pressa em vacinar os idososSe as a\u00e7\u00f5es da empresa s\u00e3o cobi\u00e7adas, as garrafas de Moutai n\u00e3o ficam atr\u00e1s. S\u00edmbolo de status e poder, uma garrafa de meio litro tem o pre\u00e7o oficial de 1.499 yuans (R$ 1258), mas em geral sai por muito mais, j\u00e1 que a oferta n\u00e3o acompanha a demanda. Em 2o18 uma garrafa de 80 anos foi arrematada num leil\u00e3o por US$ 300 mil (R$ 1,6 milh\u00e3o). A empresa \u00e9 capaz de manter os pre\u00e7os nas alturas gra\u00e7as ao teor nacionalista e sua produ\u00e7\u00e3o limitada, pois o Moutai s\u00f3 pode ser produzido na sua f\u00e1brica situada na pequena cidade que lhe d\u00e1 o nome, na prov\u00edncia de Guizhou, Sul do pa\u00eds.Quando estive l\u00e1, em 2013, o que me impressionou logo de cara foi o forte cheiro de aguardente no ar, exalado por centenas de pequenas destilarias que fazem vers\u00f5es menos nobres do baijiu, o nome gen\u00e9rico dessa bebida \u00e0 base de sorgo. A f\u00e1brica do Moutai, que pertence ao governo da prov\u00edncia, ocupa dois ter\u00e7os da cidade. Na entrada h\u00e1 uma enorme est\u00e1tua do ex-premier Zhou Enlai, que deu visibilidade internacional \u00e0 bebida ao us\u00e1-la num brinde a Richard Nixon, durante a hist\u00f3rica visita do presidente americano \u00e0 China em 1972.E mais: Como tratar a m\u00eddia estatal chinesa?Com a valoriza\u00e7\u00e3o dos \u00faltimos anos, a associa\u00e7\u00e3o do Moutai com o poder ganhou outras facetas: produto de luxo ao lado de marcas como Rolex e Louis Vuitton, moeda de especuladores e um meio de passar subornos nas altas rodas sem recorrer a dinheiro vivo \u2014 tanto que virou alvo da megacampanha contra a corrup\u00e7\u00e3o deflagrada em 2012 pelo presidente Xi Jinping. Em 2019, o ex-presidente da destilaria e seis outros executivos foram presos por corrup\u00e7\u00e3o. N\u00e3o parou por a\u00ed: o vice-governador de Guizhou pegou 20 anos de cadeia por crimes semelhantes. Na casa dele, a pol\u00edcia encontrou 4 mil garrafas de Moutai.Cinco anos depois do colapso de Xangai, analistas acham que os riscos de uma bolha hoje s\u00e3o menores. Mas o fato \u00e9 que o mercado chin\u00eas est\u00e1 reaquecido, empurrado pelo vigor da segunda economia do mundo. No ano passado, o CSI300, que re\u00fane as maiores empresas das bolsas de Xangai e Shenzhen, cresceu 27,3% (contra os 16,3% do S&P 500, de Nova York).S\u00f3 em 2021 o \u00edndice das bolsas chinesas j\u00e1 subiu quase 12% e soou o alarme para os riscos de um tombo como o de 2015. No in\u00edcio deste m\u00eas, o Banco Central chin\u00eas deu um aperto de liquidez para restringir os empr\u00e9stimos e evitar um superaquecimento dos mercados financeiros. Um novo arrocho na pol\u00edtica monet\u00e1ria passou a ser a maior preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o de muitos analistas, que consideram o temor de uma repeti\u00e7\u00e3o de 2015 exagerado, j\u00e1 que as condi\u00e7\u00f5es atuais s\u00e3o bem mais seguras. A come\u00e7ar pelo n\u00edvel de alavancagem (empr\u00e9stimos contra\u00eddos para os investimentos), que \u00e9 hoje cerca de 35% menor do que na v\u00e9spera do colapso de 2015.Acima de tudo, h\u00e1 a confian\u00e7a na recupera\u00e7\u00e3o da economia chinesa, que segundo proje\u00e7\u00e3o do Fundo Monet\u00e1rio Internacional deve crescer 8,1% em 2021, enquanto a expans\u00e3o global ficar\u00e1 em 5,5%. Em dezembro o mercado financeiro chin\u00eas teve 1,6 milh\u00e3o de novos investidores, o dobro do registrado um ano antes. Estimulados pela forte retomada chinesa ap\u00f3s o baque causado pela pandemia, investidores estrangeiros injetaram mais de US$ 150 bilh\u00f5es no mercado financeiro chin\u00eas em 2020.Nessa enxurrada de capital, as a\u00e7\u00f5es da empresa que fabrica a bebida favorita de Mao Ts\u00e9-tung viraram as queridinhas de investidores globais \u2014 embora poucos provavelmente encarassem um gole do destilado de sabor indescrit\u00edvel e 53% de teor alco\u00f3lico. O Moutai \u00e9 mais um fen\u00f4meno econ\u00f4mico que et\u00edlico: mesmo tendo 97% de suas vendas no mercado chin\u00eas, a empresa ultrapassou em valor de mercado gigantes globais como a Coca-Cola.As reformas na lei chinesa que entraram em vigor no ano passado facilitaram a entrada de investimento estrangeiro. Al\u00e9m disso, \u201cquando a pandemia come\u00e7ou, bancos centrais ao redor do mundo passaram a liberar um bocado de liquidez\u201d, lembrou Shi Xingtao, analista do HSBC em Xangai, em reportagem recente da TV estatal CGTN que questionava se a bolha de Moutai est\u00e1 prestes a estourar. Numa era de juro zero ou negativo em lugares como EUA, Jap\u00e3o e Europa, os investidores foram seduzidos pela cacha\u00e7a chinesa. Alguns temem que a festa acabe em ressaca. A apreens\u00e3o aumentou no in\u00edcio do ano, quando o fundo americano Europacific Growth, maior detentor de a\u00e7\u00f5es da Kweichow Moutai (cerca de US$ 2 bilh\u00f5es), reduziu em 5,9% os pap\u00e9is da firma no seu portf\u00f3lio.A reportagem da CGTN \u00e9 inconclusiva sobre o tamanho do risco de que os ganhos com o Moutai na bolsa venham a evaporar como \u00e1lcool. Mas conclui com uma anedota que circula nas redes sociais chinesas para ilustrar o prest\u00edgio quase m\u00edtico da bebida como um ativo invenc\u00edvel: \u201cSe a economia vai bem, \u00e9 bom para as a\u00e7\u00f5es da aguardente. Se vai mal, tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 bom, porque mais pessoas bebem para esquecer os seus problemas.\u201d"

            "description": "SHANGHAI, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Kweichow Moutai Co shares hit record levels on Wednesday after the Chinese liquor maker scrapped plans to donate $127 million to fund public projects in response to investors' objections.Moutai's shares jumped nearly 6% to a record 2,601 yuan ($403.95) on Wednesday, cementing Moutai's position as the biggest listed company in China, and the world's top liquor brand by market cap.The rally was also fuelled by the company's newly-released promotional video featuring a rap song entitled \"Oh It's Moutai\", which went viral on social media.Investors cheered after Moutai backed away from a plan to donate 820 million yuan ($127.32 million) to fund public projects including a highway and a city sewage system, which had been announced in October.Xu Caiyuan, an activist investor, hailed the decision a \"historic victory for small shareholders.\"\"Moutai is not a private asset owned by the Guizhou government. It's owned by all shareholders. Had Moutai succeeded (in making the donation), the company would have become local government officials' ATM.\"The view was widely shared by investors on social media, highlighting growing shareholder activism in China, where it used to be virtually impossible for individual investors to challenge powerful state-owned companies.\"This victory belongs to all who actively defended shareholders' rights,\" said an activist investor, who spearheaded a lawsuit by 197 shareholders in December against Moutai's donation decision. The blogger didn't disclose his name.The share rise also came after the company released a promotional video on Monday which ended up trending on social media.The song on the video, which features three foreigners travelling in China with their Chinese friend, gained immediate popularity with its catchy rhythm and youthful style. Previously, Moutai's promotions largely centered on the liquor's heritage and exclusivity.\"Awareness of the Moutai brand is penetrating into the mass consumer market,\" Citic Securities said in a report on Wednesday, adding that sales could get a boost from China's week-long Chinese New Year holiday that starts on Thursday.Moutai is traditionally popular among government officials and business elites.Although Moutai's share prices are already up 30% this year, after doubling in 2020, Citic said the stock \"still has big room to grow over the long term.\"The brokerage raised Moutai's price target to 3,000 yuan, 15% higher than the current level.

            "description": "NewsBy Phoebe FrenchJewellery firm Faberg\u00e9 has teamed up with The Craft Irish Whiskey Co. to release the Emerald Isle Collection, which costs US$2 million and includes two bottles of 30-year-old whiskey and a Faberg\u00e9 Celtic egg.The collection is presented in a walnut box and comprises two bottles of rare 30-year-old Irish whiskey; a Faberg\u00e9 Celtic egg and bespoke timepiece; a humidor with two Cohiba Siglo VI Grand Reserve cigars; a gold-plated cigar cutter; a gold plated water pipette; obsidian whiskey stones; a hip flask containing a sample of Emerald Isle whiskey; and a carafe filled with Irish spring water from the same region in which the whiskey was made.The 30-year-old triple distilled single malt whiskey was aged in 200-litre first fill American oak casks, which previously contained Bourbon. The spirit was then finished in a 40-litre Pedro Xim\u00e9nez Sherry barrel.Each set also contains a Faberg\u00e9 Celtic egg, created by fourth generation enamel worker Dr. Marcus Mohr. Made from 18k yellow gold, each egg features Faberg\u00e9\u2019s classic guilloch\u00e9 enamel in pastel green. The colours of the egg were chosen to represent the Irish flag. Each egg is set with a diamond Celtic knot that frames a coloured gemstone at its centre. Inside each egg is an uncut Zambian emerald, presented on a gold guilloch\u00e9 base with claw setting.Jay Bradley, founder of The Craft Irish Whiskey Co. commented: \u201cWe are more than delighted to be partnering with prestigious atelier Faberg\u00e9 to launch \u2018The Emerald Isle Collection,\u2019 which is an extraordinary bespoke set, and will truly put ultra-rare luxury Irish whiskies on the map. Faberg\u00e9 is an iconic brand with an enduring legacy that continues to evolve and knows no bounds, so we cannot think of a better collaboration for a luxury whiskey from Ireland. This is simply a dream come true for me and the team \u2013 and an unbelievable elevation for a 30-year whiskey, which was already going to be a particularly sought-after collector\u2019s item. With the Faberg\u00e9 addition, there is surely nothing that compares for the ultimate aficionado.\u201dAlso included in the set is the Faberg\u00e9 Altruist, an 18k rose gold timepiece with a self-winding movement sourced from Vaucher Manufacture. Each watch has a different dial and boasts an etched mother of pearl face with hand-painted 24k gold flakes.The collection was launched during a private auction in Houston, Texas this week.Josina von dem Bussche-Kessell, global sales and business development director at Faberg\u00e9, added: \u201cThis is a thrilling partnership for Faberg\u00e9, as it sees us continuing our legacy of creating unique and collectable objects, bridging the gap between historic legacy and modern-day heirlooms. Rare whiskey has seen tremendous investor attention, and the whiskey market is undergoing a dynamic evolution. It is very exciting for Faberg\u00e9 to participate in such a cross-pollination of luxury sectors, thereby adding a contemporary twist on age old traditions.\u201d",

            "description": "Chinese liquor giant Moutai is taking a series of moves aimed at keeping bottles of its namesake spirit to $230 apiece, even as some sell for double that in the run-up to the Lunar New Year. Photo: VCGKweichow Moutai Co. Ltd. is struggling to tap down head-spinning prices for its signature liquor, even as they top 3,000 yuan ($465) per bottle in the run-up to next week\u2019s Lunar New Year holiday, a traditional time of peak demand.The world\u2019s largest liquor-maker has urged its distributors to sell its namesake spirit for 1,499 yuan per bottle, even as prices were topping 2,500 yuan in late January. In some instances bottles were going for as much as 3,200 yuan each for highly coveted cases containing six bottles each, according to multiple securities companies.\u201cThe prices have only gotten higher, despite concerted efforts to contain them,\u201d a Moutai regional sales manager told Caixin. He said the company has negotiated at multiple meetings with distributors to control the prices, but also worries about putting too much pressure on its longtime partners.At the heart of the matter is Moutai\u2019s position as a status symbol in China, making it the liquor of choice at any high-profile gathering. That status has made buying Moutai into a sort of investment for many, who may hoard the fiery spirit known locally as \u201cbaijiu\u201d to wait for just the right price or occasion before parting with their treasure.Among its many recent steps to rein in prices, the company has clamped down on distributors who charge premiums over suggested retail prices, and requested all bottles be sold individually rather than in the six-bottle cases. It is also discouraging vendors from stockpiling the liquor and barring some consumers from buying the drink.The company initially said that starting from Jan. 1, all franchisee partners needed to sell at least 80% of their Moutai stock every month for 1,499 yuan per bottle. It also asked distributors to keep the packaging material to prove they were selling individual bottles and not the boxes of six. It later said all bottles must sell for 1,499 each, all part of a bid to prevent vendors from stockpiling the liquor in hopes of getting higher prices later.Such stockpiling has been common in the past, since bottles of Moutai can typically increase in value by 10% per year \u2014 offering better returns than many other forms of investment.Even when it\u2019s sold at 1,499 yuan, scalpers often wait outside supermarkets to stock up and later resell their booty for much higher prices. At peak periods, such scalpers can earn an extra 1,000 yuan per bottle, according to one, who told Caixin that he could collect up to 200 bottles a day in Beijing.Frothy spirits, frothier stockInvestors truly looking to cash in on Moutai\u2019s big name need look no further than the company\u2019s publicly-traded shares, whose meteoric rise in recent years has made it the world\u2019s most valuable liquor-maker. The company\u2019s shares have roughly doubled over the last year, giving it a market capitalization of more than $400 billion.The broader value of baijiu, the general class of high-alcohol spirits that includes Moutai, is expected to continue on a bullish trend this year, according to a report from Minsheng Securities. The report pointed out that such spirits have been traded as a form of investment, and that such trends could help to further drive up Moutai and other baijiu shares.Back at street-level, the company\u2019s tireless campaign to rein in prices continues with the latest initiatives.The company is now requiring vendors to sell their entire inventories by Feb. 11, Lunar New Year\u2019s Eve, when many families gather for a traditional big meal similar to Christmas in the West. By doing so, the distiller hopes to stimulate more consumers to actually drink the alcohol, rather than purchasing it for investment and collection purposes.As that happens, online platforms that sell the liquor appear to be lowering previous requirements for buyers. Two leading sites, JD.com and Suning.com, previously restricted purchases of Moutai to their paid members. But in February, there were signs that such requirement had been lifted , Caixin observed, with all registered users now allowed to order the spirit.JD.com and Suning.com would not comment on whether their loosened restrictions were made in response to requests from Moutai. But the operator of one of the country\u2019s biggest retail chains, Wumart Holding Inc., said it had not received any notice from the company to lift any curbs on buyers.Contact reporter Anniek Bao (yunxinbao@caixin.com)Download our app to receive breaking news alerts and read the news on the go.",

            "description": "SHANGHAI, Feb 4 (Reuters) - A slump in Chinese small-cap stocks has left many retail investors nursing losses despite strength in the broader market, as institutional investors flock to blue-chip names.The CSI1000 index, mainly comprising firms with a market value of less than 20 billion yuan ($3.09 billion), dropped 2.2% on Thursday to a near eight-month low, bringing its losses for the year to more than 7%.China's CSI300 blue-chip index, in contrast, is up more than 5% for the year after a 27% rise in 2020.\"This is a 'stock crash' bull run,\" said Eric, a retail investor in the central province of Henan, who declined to give his last name.The phrase, which refers to a small group of large companies gaining while many others fall, has been trending on China's Weibo social media platform in recent days as the gap between haves and have-nots has widened.China's top liquor maker and biggest listed company Kweichow Moutai, popular with asset managers, jumped as much as 6.4% to a new record high on Thursday, taking its market value to 2.6 trillion yuan.The disparity between small and large firms has become even starker following registration-based IPO reforms on Shanghai's STAR Market and Shenzhen's ChiNext last year, which have increased equity supply and pressured valuations.Some retail investors hoping to hitch a ride on the broader bull run have been especially hard-hit after they continued to place bets on small firms.\"My 70% gain in 2020 has dwindled to only 15%,\" said Muzi, an investor who has been posting about the small-cap slump on Weibo. She said she has lost 15,000 yuan, or three months' salary, since November.Institutional investors have taken a different approach. Hong Yanhua, chairman of Zhejiang Murong Asset Management, said he was no longer interested in small-cap companies, seeing large companies as safer bets.\"Nobody wants shares of small firms now, as it's really difficult to trade them,\" he said.Rather than looking onshore, Hong said he is seeking bargains in Hong Kong.

As proje\u00e7\u00f5es apontam que, at\u00e9 2028, o pa\u00eds deve ultrapassar os Estados Unidos e assumir o posto de maior economia global.Em um cen\u00e1rio como esse, que conta ainda com uma alta apenas moderada da taxa Selic \u00e0 frente, e ainda abaixo da infla\u00e7\u00e3o em 2021, \u00e9 mais do que natural o aumento do interesse do brasileiro pelas oportunidades de investimento al\u00e9m das fronteiras dom\u00e9sticas.E ap\u00f3s o in\u00edcio do processo de internacionaliza\u00e7\u00e3o de um peda\u00e7o do portf\u00f3lio durante o ano passado voltado para a\u00e7\u00f5es nas bolsas americanas principalmente, as oportunidades oferecidas por um crescimento t\u00e3o robusto como o chin\u00eas ficam, a cada dia que passa, mais dif\u00edceis de serem ignoradas.Confira a seguir os produtos nas prateleiras de bancos e corretoras que oferecem a possibilidade do investidor brasileiro tirar proveito do ciclo positivo da China.CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADENo ano passado, o \u00edndice MSCI China, que re\u00fane cerca de 600 grandes empresas do gigante asi\u00e1tico, teve rentabilidade de aproximadamente 30%, quase o dobro dos ganhos do S&P 500.Por conta disso, ao longo dos \u00faltimos meses, gestoras, bancos e corretoras, com uma forcinha da Comiss\u00e3o de Valores Mobili\u00e1rios (CVM), se apressaram em rechear as prateleiras com fundos, de gest\u00e3o passiva ou ativa, dedicados \u00e0s a\u00e7\u00f5es das maiores e mais promissoras empresas da China.Na XP, por exemplo, desde junho de 2020 qualquer investidor interessado pode investir no fundo Trend Bolsa Chinesa FIM, produto com prote\u00e7\u00e3o cambial e t\u00edquete m\u00ednimo de R$ 100,00, que segue a trajet\u00f3ria do MSCI China.\u2022 Saiba mais sobre as oportunidades e os riscos na China nestes pain\u00e9is do Onde Investir 2021Conforme as perspectivas para o mercado chin\u00eas se mostraram cada vez mais positivas ao longo dos \u00faltimos meses, a oferta de produtos dedicados \u00e0 regi\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m aumentou, explica Fabiano Cintra, especialista de fundos internacionais da XP.CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADES\u00f3 que, dessa vez, com um foco mais voltado \u00e0 gest\u00e3o ativa, via parcerias com grandes casas internacionais, como JP Morgan Asset e Wellington Management.\u201cA China h\u00e1 muito tempo deixou de ser um ativo ex\u00f3tico para se tornar, na vis\u00e3o da XP, um item b\u00e1sico na carteira do investidor\u201d, afirma Cintra, acrescentando que os novos fundos dedicados \u00e0 China das gestoras globais t\u00eam sido lan\u00e7ados em duas vers\u00f5es \u2013 em d\u00f3lar, quando o investidor fica exposto \u00e0 varia\u00e7\u00e3o do c\u00e2mbio, e em reais, em que \u00e9 feito o hedge contra o risco da moeda.Por quest\u00f5es regulat\u00f3rias, os fundos internacionais de gest\u00e3o ativa, por terem uma exposi\u00e7\u00e3o global acima dos 20% permitidos aos produtos voltados ao p\u00fablico geral, s\u00e3o por enquanto apenas para o investidor qualificado (com investimentos financeiros a partir de R$ 1 milh\u00e3o), embora esteja na pauta da CVM para 2021 avaliar a possibilidade de mudar as regras e permitir o acesso a qualquer interessado.Giuliano De Marchi, respons\u00e1vel pelo JP Morgan Asset Management na Am\u00e9rica Latina, ressalta que a presen\u00e7a global da casa, inclusive na pr\u00f3pria China, \u00e9 um importante diferencial para fazer uma an\u00e1lise aprofundada e certeira dos melhores nomes do mercado local.\u201cSomos super otimistas com o mercado chin\u00eas, que est\u00e1 crescendo violentamente\u201d, afirma De Marchi. \u201cN\u00e3o tem como n\u00e3o prestar aten\u00e7\u00e3o.\u201dCONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADEEntre as maiores posi\u00e7\u00f5es do fundo JP Morgan China Equity, dispon\u00edvel na plataforma da XP para o investidor qualificado a partir de R$ 500, est\u00e3o nomes com os quais o brasileiro ainda tem bem pouca familiaridade, mas que se tratam de grandes pot\u00eancias globais, diz o executivo, citando como exemplos o grupo segurador Ping An, ou as fabricantes de bebidas Kweichow Moutai e Wuliangye Yibin.A grande tese de investimento do fundo \u00e9 o consumo dom\u00e9stico chin\u00eas, explica Isabella Nunes, respons\u00e1vel pelo relacionamento com investidores no Brasil. \u201cConhecer Alibaba, Tencent, \u00e9 muito mais f\u00e1cil. Mas essas que temos na carteira, voltadas ao mercado local chin\u00eas, n\u00e3o, e s\u00e3o neg\u00f3cios que cresceram muito nos \u00faltimos anos\u201d, acrescenta a especialista.BDRs de ETFsAl\u00e9m dos fundos, outra maneira que o investidor brasileiro ganhou recentemente para alocar parte do dinheiro na China \u00e9 por meio dos BDRs de ETFs.Isso porque as mudan\u00e7as promovidas pela CVM no segundo semestre de 2020 para facilitar o acesso do investidor pessoa f\u00edsica aos ativos no exterior permitiu tamb\u00e9m \u00e0s gestoras oferecerem BDRs que replicam o desempenho de fundos de \u00edndices (ETFs) globais, os BDRs de ETFs.Dessa forma, o investidor compra o ativo negociado na B3 e se exp\u00f5e a uma cesta diversificada de a\u00e7\u00f5es que espelha grandes benchmarks internacionais.CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADEJ\u00e1 preparadas para a mudan\u00e7a na legisla\u00e7\u00e3o, no fim de novembro a BlackRock e a B3 anunciaram o lan\u00e7amento de 37 BDRs de ETFs. E diante das perspectivas positivas para a economia da \u00c1sia emergente nos pr\u00f3ximos anos, sete dos produtos t\u00eam o foco na regi\u00e3o, diz Carlos Takahashi, presidente da BlackRock no Brasil.Entre eles, o iShares MSCI China, que era negociado em 27 de janeiro a cerca de R$ 60 na B3, al\u00e9m de outros em que a din\u00e2mica da economia chinesa tamb\u00e9m tem peso bastante relevante, como o iShares MSCI Hong Kong, o iShares MSCI Taiwan e o iShares MSCI Emerging Markets.Segundo o executivo da gestora, a expectativa \u00e9 encerrar o ano de 2021 com cerca de cem BDRs de ETFs globais no pa\u00eds. \u201cTemos buscado trazer produtos com baixa correla\u00e7\u00e3o ou at\u00e9 negativa com os investimentos do brasileiro, em termos de regi\u00f5es ou de estrat\u00e9gias\u201d, afirma Takahashi.Democratiza\u00e7\u00e3oOs ETFs de BDRs, por quest\u00f5es de car\u00e1ter operacional, s\u00e3o acess\u00edveis hoje apenas para o investidor qualificado, mas a previs\u00e3o \u00e9 que ainda no primeiro semestre o acesso seja liberado para o p\u00fablico geral.De todo modo, aproveitando o embalo, a BB DTVM selecionou quatro dos ETFs de BDRs e empacotou em fundos pr\u00f3prios, dentro de uma estrutura que permite \u00e0 gestora oferecer o produto para qualquer interessado, explica Isaac Marcovistz, respons\u00e1vel pela \u00e1rea de produtos, comunica\u00e7\u00e3o e marketing da BB DTVM.CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADEOs fundos t\u00eam taxa de administra\u00e7\u00e3o entre 0,85% e 1% ao ano, com aplica\u00e7\u00e3o inicial a partir de R$ 0,01.Dos quatro produtos, dois acompanham o desempenho de \u00edndices de refer\u00eancia globais que t\u00eam uma presen\u00e7a chinesa importante em sua composi\u00e7\u00e3o, de aproximadamente 40%.S\u00e3o eles o BB A\u00e7\u00f5es Bolsas Asi\u00e1ticas ex-Jap\u00e3o BDR ETF N\u00edvel I, que considera os principais emergentes da regi\u00e3o, com a exclus\u00e3o do Jap\u00e3o, e o BB A\u00e7\u00f5es Bolsas Emergentes BDR ETF N\u00edvel I, em que os pa\u00edses asi\u00e1ticos como China, Taiwan, Cor\u00e9ia do Sul e \u00cdndia respondem por cerca de 80% do total. O peso do Brasil \u00e9 de aproximadamente 5%.Na mesma leva, tamb\u00e9m foram lan\u00e7ados pela gestora do Banco do Brasil fundos de a\u00e7\u00f5es de abrang\u00eancia global, sem restri\u00e7\u00e3o de regi\u00f5es, e com o foco em Europa.Segundo Marcovistz, enquanto o investidor que compra o BDR de ETF diretamente na Bolsa acaba tendo exposi\u00e7\u00e3o indireta \u00e0 varia\u00e7\u00e3o cambial, no caso dos fundos da gestora, a op\u00e7\u00e3o foi por fazer a prote\u00e7\u00e3o contra a oscila\u00e7\u00e3o da moeda, de modo a reduzir a volatilidade do produto.E com o valor simb\u00f3lico de um centavo para investir nos fundos, o objetivo \u00e9 permitir ao investidor, mesmo com pouco dinheiro, fazer uma carteira bem diversificada, comenta Marcovistz. \u201cTemos uma preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o grande de colocar na grade produtos com boa diversidade tamb\u00e9m para o varejo\u201d, afirma o executivo.J\u00e1 na Bradesco Asset Management (Bram), o fundo \u201cAustralasia\u201d, lan\u00e7ado em 2013 e voltado ao investidor qualificado, tamb\u00e9m tem como benchmark o \u00edndice MSCI de bolsas asi\u00e1ticas com a exclus\u00e3o do Jap\u00e3o, e a inclus\u00e3o da Austr\u00e1lia.Com aplica\u00e7\u00e3o inicial de R$ 20 mil e 0,5% de taxa de administra\u00e7\u00e3o, o fundo rendeu 63,5% no ano passado, ap\u00f3s uma alta j\u00e1 expressiva de cerca de 30% no ano anterior, impulsionada tanto pela valoriza\u00e7\u00e3o das bolsas asi\u00e1ticas, como do c\u00e2mbio. O fundo fica exposto indiretamente \u00e0s moedas dos respectivos pa\u00edses de cada um dos investimentos, explica Roberto Shinkai, administrador de carteiras da Bram.Para fazer a gest\u00e3o do fundo, a gestora do Bradesco se vale de uma parceria com o Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), que conta com um profissional baseado em Cingapura para fazer a sele\u00e7\u00e3o dos pap\u00e9is por meio de uma an\u00e1lise que considera crit\u00e9rios tanto quantitativos como qualitativos.Entre as principais posi\u00e7\u00f5es, Shinkai cita nomes como Alibaba, Taiwan Semiconductor e Tencent, com cerca de 60% da carteira exposta \u00e0 China ou adjac\u00eancias, como Hong Kong e Taiwan.\u201cO produto captura o crescimento n\u00e3o apenas da China, mas de outros emergentes que tamb\u00e9m se beneficiam dessa tend\u00eancia\u201d, diz o gestor da Bram, em refer\u00eancia a pa\u00edses como \u00cdndia e Cor\u00e9ia do Sul.A arte de delegarAl\u00e9m da op\u00e7\u00e3o de investir via fundos, com a recente flexibiliza\u00e7\u00e3o regulat\u00f3ria para que qualquer interessado possa investir em BDRs diretamente, com a exce\u00e7\u00e3o por enquanto dos BDRs de ETFs, o brasileiro hoje pode comprar na B3 recibos que correspondem \u00e0s a\u00e7\u00f5es de grandes empresas chinesas negociadas originalmente nas bolsas dos Estados Unidos.Dos cerca de 670 BDRs dispon\u00edveis, cerca de 20 s\u00e3o de companhias do gigante asi\u00e1tico, tendo o conglomerado de e-commerce Alibaba como um dos nomes mais conhecidos.No entanto, dadas a dist\u00e2ncia geogr\u00e1fica e a barreira da l\u00edngua, a indica\u00e7\u00e3o majorit\u00e1ria entre os especialistas de mercado \u00e9 que o investidor fa\u00e7a o investimento internacional com a gest\u00e3o profissional de uma casa especializada no tema.\u201cOs fundos conseguem fazer as trocas de posi\u00e7\u00f5es com uma agilidade muito maior do que n\u00f3s, que n\u00e3o estamos seguindo o mercado no detalhe, a cada minuto\u201d, afirmou Ronaldo Patah, estrategista do UBS Wealth Management, durante o evento Onde Investir 2021.Al\u00e9m disso, continuou o especialista, ao investir individualmente em diversas a\u00e7\u00f5es de modo a ter uma boa diversifica\u00e7\u00e3o da carteira, o pr\u00f3prio trabalho operacional que o investidor ter\u00e1, al\u00e9m do tempo gasto para estudar as companhias, n\u00e3o parece t\u00e3o interessante frente ao resultado obtido, em compara\u00e7\u00e3o aos fundos.\u201cJ\u00e1 \u00e9 uma coisa sofisticada investir em ativos offshore, ent\u00e3o eu prefiro que voc\u00ea delegue para um gestor profissional do que tente acertar sozinho\u201d, afirmou Patah, que foi acompanhado pelo gestor da Taler, Renato Iversson, tamb\u00e9m presente ao evento.\u201cSe voc\u00ea est\u00e1 come\u00e7ando a investir l\u00e1 fora, entre via fundo, acompanhe o gestor, leia bastante, e depois, se quiser, voc\u00ea come\u00e7a a fazer sua pr\u00f3pria carteira\u201d, sugeriu Iversson.Participe do Treinamento gratuito Scalper Pro e entenda como extrair lucro e controlar riscos na Bolsa em opera\u00e7\u00f5es que duram minutos ou segundos!

            "description": "When Costco opened its first store in China in 2019, it wasn\u2019t just the hot rotisserie chickens and discounted Birkin bags that lured frenzied crowds. A fiery, throat-tingling liquor called Kweichow Moutai also flew off shelves.At 1,498 yuan, or $209 for a half-liter bottle, it might not sound like the kind of bargain Costco shoppers usually go for \u2014 but in this case, it absolutely was. That price represented a steep discount over Moutai sold elsewhere \u2014 that is, if you could get your hands on it. The luxury spirit is so beloved in China, it sold out quickly.Even amid a global pandemic, Kweichow Moutai, the company that makes the eponymous liquor, had a banner year: its stock surged around 70% on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2020. The company, which is part state-owned and part publicly-traded, is China\u2019s most valuable firm outside of technology \u2014 worth more than the country\u2019s four biggest banks. Globally, its market cap has not only surpassed all other alcohol distillers like Diageo and Constellation Brands, but also Coca-Cola, which had long held the crown as the world\u2019s largest beverage maker by market cap. Valued at 2.7 trillion yuan, or $421 billion, Kweichow Moutai is worth more than Toyota, Nike and Disney, too.\u201cAnytime they have any stock [of the product] available, it\u2019s going to be gone almost instantly,\u201d said Ben Cavender, the Shanghai-based managing director of China Market Research Group. \u201cYou\u2019ll see people clamoring [for it].\u201dApart from the Chinese diaspora, however, Moutai is still virtually unknown overseas. Almost all \u2014 about 97% \u2014 of its sales come from China alone, according to its financial reports.So how is a company that sells its products primarily in just one country now worth more than some longstanding global behemoths? And can Kweichow Moutai, which is described by some Westerners as \u201cdrinking liquid razor blades,\u201d succeed in appealing to non-Chinese consumers?An employee displays China's leading liquor maker Kweichow Moutai at a supermarket in Nantong city, in China's Jiangsu province in 2018. Xu congjun/Imaginechina/APFrom historic icon to status symbolMoutai has one unmistakable advantage: the drink is China\u2019s national spirit.Moutai baijiu \u2014 the type of liquor the company makes \u2014 is a clear, potent spirit that\u2019s been dubbed \u201cfirewater,\u201d thanks to the fact that it\u2019s 53% alcohol. The red-and-white bottles of its flagship product, \u201cFeitian,\u201d or \u201cFlying Fairy,\u201d are a staple at Chinese state banquets and business events.I think if we drink enough Moutai, we can solve anything.\u201d Henry Kissinger, US Secretary of State, speaking in 1974Known as the favorite tipple of Mao Zedong, founder of Communist China, and as the \u201cdrink of diplomacy,\u201d it was famously used to welcome former US President Richard Nixon on his historic trip to China in 1972, and again in 2013 when Chinese President Xi Jinping met with his US counterpart, Barack Obama, in California.Once, at a state dinner in 1974, US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger told Deng Xiaoping, the future Chinese leader: \u201cI think if we drink enough Moutai, we can solve anything.\u201d\u201cThen, when I go back to China, we must take steps to increase our production of it,\u201d Deng responded, according to an archived US government transcript.President Richard Nixon toasting Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai at banquet in China in 1972. John Dominis/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty ImagesBeing part of so many major public events in China \u201creally set the brand in the national consciousness,\u201d said Cavender, who likened it to another giant beverage maker, Coca-Cola, in that regard.\u201cThat\u2019s the same reason why Coke has actually done so well from a marketing perspective. If you look at the way they\u2019ve done their advertising over the past 50 years, they\u2019re at pretty much every big event. You see Coke at when the Berlin Wall comes down. You see Coke commercials at Christmas. I think Moutai is that brand for China, and so I think that part explains why it\u2019s so popular.\u201dA Moutai representative declined requests to be interviewed for this story.Some say the story goes back even further in Communist Party lore. During the Red Army\u2019s \u201cLong March\u201d in China in the 1930s, soldiers used to pour Moutai on their feet to help disinfect wounds, Chinese state media has reported, citing a former army lieutenant general.Legend has it that members of the Red Army even used to turn to the drink to knock themselves out before surgery, said Hao Hong, head of research at BOCOM International, the securities arm of China\u2019s Bank of Communications.\u201cIt\u2019s a story [that goes around],\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have anesthesia. So they had to use Moutai as a drug to numb [people] from surgery.\u201dToday, the brand is seen more as a luxury status symbol than for its \u201cRed\u201d roots. Some customers buy it not to drink, but to keep as investments. Limited-edition cases are collected and showcased by international auction houses, like Christie\u2019s, which says that some bottles can fetch more than $40,000 each.Moutai products being placed in a liquor store in the town of Maotai in Guizhou province, China, last June. Costfoto/Barcroft Media/Getty ImagesMoutai has found a way to be \u201capproachable for a lot of regular consumers, at least for special occasions,\u201d while at the same time also offering collectors\u2019 items that reach the ultra-rich, said Cavender.\u201cThat\u2019s something that makes Moutai, I think, different, from a lot of the international beverage brands,\u201d he said.It\u2019s also been a tremendous advantage during an economically tough year: wealthy consumers who are spending less on travel may splurge more on liquor, Cavender added.A meteoric riseMoutai has long been seen as one of China\u2019s blue-chip stocks. In 2017, it became the world\u2019s biggest liquor maker by market value, surpassing Diageo (DEO), the British owner of Johnnie Walker, Guinness and Tanqueray.In 2019, Moutai also became the first Chinese company since 2005 to see its share price hit 1,000 yuan (about $145), notching another market record. And last year, it became the most valuable non-tech company in China. (Alibaba and Tencent, the country\u2019s top two tech giants, are valued higher, with their shares listed in New York and Hong Kong respectively.)In 2020, Moutai\u2019s shares soared 69% to record highs.Hong said that he believed there was no major impetus for the rally last year; just that \u201cmost people are gradually realizing the ability of this company to be able to generate strong cash flow and no debt.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like a badge of honor for value investing,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople love the stock \u2014 because year after year, it just continues to deliver.\u201dXian Li, a 66-year-old retiree in Shanghai, is one of those people. He\u2019s invested in Moutai since 2004, just three years after it went public.China's 5 largest publicly-traded companies by market cap Tencent: $737B Alibaba: $637B Kweichow Moutai: $421B Industrial and Commercial Bank of China: $268B Ping An Insurance Group: $244B Source: RefinitivLi said he was excited to buy in because it was clear from the beginning that the company was \u201cfinancially healthy,\u201d and able to reward shareholders with a generous dividend.Since then, he\u2019s invested more than 136,000 yuan (about $21,000) into the stock. The payoff has been huge: a few years ago, he made enough to put his son through university.\u201cThe dividend [alone] each year could cover my daily expenses,\u201d said Li, who plans to hold onto the stock indefinitely. \u201cIt\u2019s also going to help me to afford medical bills and nursing home expenses.\u201dNot everyone is so bullish. Allen Cheng, an equity analyst at Morningstar, made headlines in 2019 when he downgraded his rating on Moutai\u2019s stock to sell.Cheng, who has since maintained that position, argues that the company\u2019s prospects are overblown, and that \u201cthe market has already reflected all the positives of the past 10 years.\u201d\u201cBeing the only hater is really difficult for me,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bubble here.\u201dAuthorities, too, have warned investors of a potential stock bubble. In 2017, Moutai suffered a huge selloff \u2014 wiping $7.8 billion off its market cap in one day \u2014 after state-run news agency Xinhua, which often conveys the Communist leadership\u2019s sentiment, urged investors to take a more \u201crational view\u201d of the company.It\u2019s like a badge of honor for value investing. People love the stock \u2014 because year after year, it just continues to deliver.\u201d Hao Hong, head of research at BOCOM International, the securities arm of China's Bank of Communications\u201cIt\u2019s important for Kweichow Moutai \u2026 to stick to its slow pace,\u201d Xinhua said in an editorial. \u201cPulling up a plant to make it grow inevitably leads to unbearable pain. Short-sighted speculation will cause tremendous damage to the value of investment.\u201dThe move was not uncommon. Beijing frequently tries to sway investors through state media, such as last summer, when a government-run publication encouraged people to buy into stocks.That could have a domino effect, particularly because mainland Chinese stock markets are dominated by retail investors. According to a 2020 survey by the China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation, almost all investors there \u2014 99% \u2014 were individuals.The making of MoutaiOne of Moutai\u2019s biggest advantages is its ability to keep the price of its product high. It claims to have limited capacity since it can only produce its drinks in one place.Similar to champagne \u2014 which comes from the eponymous region in France \u2014 Kweichow Moutai is named after Maotai, a picturesque small town in the southwestern Chinese province of Guizhou. (The company\u2019s name is based on an old romanization of the town\u2019s Chinese name.) Like champagne, the drink can only be called Moutai if it\u2019s produced in that specific location.This is where the company says its baijiu \u2014 distilled from fermented sorghum and rice \u2014 gets the magic touch.A worker at a Moutai distillery in November 2020. Ou Dongqu/Xinhua/Getty ImagesEnvironmental factors, such as the town\u2019s climate and seasonal changes in the water of the local river, help give the liquor its unique taste and is \u201cbeneficial to the production process,\u201d according to the Moutai Museum.Inside the town, Moutai\u2019s impact on the economy is deeply felt.As of 2019, Maotai was the richest town in western China, according to disposable income statistics from the municipal government of Renhuai, in Guizhou province. (Guizhou is among the country\u2019s poorest regions.)That would never have happened if it weren\u2019t for the beverage giant, said Qi Wang, a local resident.\u201cKweichow Moutai is the leader of Maotai,\u201d he said, adding that the company\u2019s boom helped encourage him to open his own liquor factory. \u201cIt influences all aspects of the town\u2019s development.\u201dIts close ties with the government don\u2019t always guarantee protection, though.In 2013, sales slumped when President Xi embarked on an anti-corruption drive, leading the government to stamp out any sign of \u201cextravagance\u201d among officials, including of expensive liquor.The campaign led to \u201cunprecedented pressure\u201d on the alcohol industry, Moutai noted in an earnings report.Sales still grew that year, but only around 17%, compared to 44% the previous year. In 2014, that number plunged to about 2%.The firm has since bounced back \u2014 though it now faces other problems. In recent years, it\u2019s been dogged by numerous corruption scandals, which has led to the ouster of several top executives, according to state media.Other major firms have faced similar pressure. China regularly investigates powerful executives for corruption \u2014 while using the findings to send a warning to others. This month, a Chinese court sentenced Lai Xiaomin, the former chief of a top, state-owned financial firm, to death for bribery.Is China enough?Moutai has an outsize reliance on the Chinese market.To be sure, the company has tried to push overseas, notably by starting a \u201cfan club\u201d in the United States, traveling to Africa to woo new business partners and teaming up with foreign players, such as Italy\u2019s Inter Milan soccer club.But for the most part, it\u2019s had little to show for it. In 2019, almost 97% of sales still came from China.Last March, the company launched a social media campaign called \u201cstay at home with Moutai,\u201d which encouraged users around the world to try new recipes during lockdown. One Instagram and Twitter post, for instance, suggested mixing the drink into a \u201csunset cocktail,\u201d while another offered instructions for a noodle dish that could pair with the liquor.The campaign demonstrated an effort to stay connected with international consumers, even during the pandemic. But analysts have pointed to other challenges ahead.Moutai needs to do more to diversify, according to Spiros Malandrakis, industry manager of alcoholic drinks at Euromonitor International. \u201cIt needs to have started yesterday,\u201d he said. \u201cInternational spirits always start local, like baijiu, but they become international. That\u2019s the key. That\u2019s how you take over the world. That\u2019s how you become sustainably big.\u201dA customer shops for Kweichow Moutai at a supermarket in Nantong city, east China's Jiangsu province in December 2018. Xu congjun/Imaginechina/APMalandrakis pointed to Mexican tequila, Russian vodka and American bourbon as examples. None of those \u201cwould have survived\u201d if they didn\u2019t go global, he added.The process, of course, doesn\u2019t happen overnight.William Dong, managing director of Evershine Australia, which distributes Moutai in Australia, New Zealand and Italy, said that many people still need to be educated about what baijiu even is.\u201cWe have distributed the product into basically everywhere that we could,\u201d he said in an interview from Sydney.At the end of the day, most customers are still Chinese, he added. \u201cI would say probably 80%.\u201dIt doesn\u2019t help that the drink is an acquired taste. Some people eschew Moutai\u2019s strong kick, while others label it \u201cfirewater.\u201d\u201c[Some] Westerners find it, and I quote, \u2018kind of like drinking liquid razor blades,\u2019\u201d said Malandrakis.An even bigger threat, however, may be generational and gender gaps within China. Currently, the core demographic for baijiu is 40 to 60-year-old men, according to Malandrakis.800 drones perform in teams in the night sky to form a \"Moutai wine bottle\" pattern in Renhuai, Guizhou, China in June 2020. Costfoto/Barcroft Media/Getty Images\u201cThe next generation of drinkers does not particularly want to do exactly what their father\u2019s generation did,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not great for the future, if you don\u2019t start having new people coming in.\u201dMalandrakis compared it to sherry, which was loved for centuries but later fell out of popularity as it \u201cbecame synonymous with consumption of older populations.\u201dNot everyone is so worried. Even with its weak international position, Moutai\u2019s baijiu was the world\u2019s best-selling liquor in 2019, according to Euromonitor.The next generation of drinkers does not particularly want to do exactly what their father\u2019s generation did. It\u2019s not great for the future, if you don\u2019t start having new people coming in.\u201d SPIROS MALANDRAKIS, INDUSTRY MANAGER OF ALCOHOLIC DRINKS AT EUROMONITOR INTERNATIONAL\u201cThe Chinese market is so big, and it\u2019s continuing to become more wealthy,\u201d said Cavender. He also noted a recent swell in local pride, which could draw more domestic consumers in.For all its challenges, even critics admit the company\u2019s dominance is nowhere near diminishing.\u201cThe brand \u2014 and the heritage that the brand has \u2014 it\u2019s really impossible to replicate that,\u201d Cavender said. \u201cSomebody can\u2019t set up a new venture tomorrow and do what they can do. It\u2019s not sort of possible to go back in time and get Mao Zedong to be interested in your drink. It\u2019s not possible to sort of be located in the town where they make their products. So I think they have a strong built-in story that allows them to flourish.\u201d",

Its place in Chinese culture is firmly entrenched due to alcohol-related Chinese folklore associated with many famous historical figures such as Li Bai (701-762), one of China's most notable poets, who was believed to have written hundreds of well-known poems while drinking the alcohol.There are many types and fragrances of baijiu, and as many names relating to the methods of producing it. The Terminology of Baijiu Industry also identified English names for different types and fragrances of Chinese Baijiu, such as \"laobaigan xiang xing baijiu\" and \"jiang xiang xing baijiu\" for liquors produced through different processes, with typical flavors that are naturally generated during their fermentation processes.An industry insider from the China Alcoholic Drinks Association thinks that the revised English name will play a positive role in accurately describing Chinese Baijiu as a national product, standardizing the export name of the liquor and expanding the international influence of the Chinese liquor, Sichuan Daily reported.",

            "description": "Bottles of Moutai. Photo: VCGThe Chinese spirit industry has hailed the official adoption of \"Chinese Baijiu,\" as the new term for domestic distilled spirit labeling, following an application by the China Alcoholic Drinks Association (CADA) in April 2020. Industry experts said that the move might not have an immediate impact on the industry but would be significant for the global market in the long run.This remark came as the share prices of the two major Chinese spirit makers fell again on Thursday, ending two weeks of steady gains. Wuliangye opened at 304 yuan ($46.9) and fell all day to end at 289 yuan, down 5.22 percent. Kweichow Moutai closed at 2,134 yuan, a drop of 1.39 percent.Word of the new term went viral online and became one of the top 10 topics on China's twitter-like social media platform Sina Weibo on Thursday, with many netizens applauding the change and saying the new name will be like tofu or jiaozi, which have entered the English language as generic terms. The famous Chinese spirit has gone under dozens of different names until now, experts said.Although accounting for one-third of global distilled spirit consumption due to China's huge consumer base, Chinese Baijiu has lacked a formal English name and was often named Chinese spirits, Chinese distilled spirits or Chinese liquor.Chinese Baijiu, together with brandy, whisky, vodka, rum and gin, ranks among the top six distilled spirits in the world, according to the CADA. But for years, Chinese Baijiu lacked an official, accurate English name, causing confusion among overseas consumers.Liquor as an important part of Chinese culture has a production history of more than 2,000 years. The spirit adopts natural, multi-strain solid-state fermentation and distillation, and it's completely different from the traditional concept of distilled spirits in the West.The new English terminology reflects the true nature of Chinese Baijiu as an independent product category, and that makes it significant, an industry insider told the Global Times on Thursday.\"The share prices have nothing to do with the operation of the companies, nor do they fully reflect the actual market situation,\" the insider said.Chinese customs officially adopted \"Chinese Baijiu\" as the new name for the drink, after repeated communication with the tax collection bureau of the Chinese customs authorities, according to the CADA.The official English name was used in the 2021 Import and Export Tariff of the People's Republic of China, which was implemented on January 1, media reports said.",

            "description": "NewsBy Patrick SchmittThe official retail figures for Christmas-time Champagne sales in the UK have just been released, and it\u2019s official: the Brits drank more during the pandemic, and particularly during a lockdown festive period.The results come from data analyst Nielsen and show Champagne moving annual total (MAT) retail sales by volume to the end of 2020 up 3%, while sparkling wine sales have increased by 10% over the same period.Notably, over the four week festive period to week-end 26.12.20, Champagne sales increased by 13%, surpassing the growth in sparkling wine, which rose by 9%.In terms of the value growth, Champagne\u2019s increases were even greater, up 12% (MAT to WE 26.12.2020), and up 16% for 4 weeks to WE 26.12.2020 (see the figures in full at the bottom of this article).As for the average price of a bottle of Champagne in UK retailers, that has, for the first time, broken past \u00a325, increasing year on year by 5.3% to hit \u00a325.15.And, the growth in volume and value sales of Champagne in the UK retail sector is probably greater than Nielsen has recorded, with importers of the fizz in the UK recording rising demand for Champagne through online leviathan Amazon and the key fine wine merchants, from Bordeaux Index to Berry Bros & Rudd, whose sales are not tracked by Nielsen.Indeed, Nielsen\u2019s figures tend to reflect sales in supermarkets and multiple specialists, which would mean that it fails to capture much of the very high value sales of Champagne, particular the prestige cuv\u00e9e releases, which tend to go through fine wine specialists.However, other indicators can be used to track this sector, such as Liv-ex, which has recorded a booming secondary market for top-end Champagne, which has been fuelled by the primary market releases this year.Indeed, as previously reported by db, The Champagne 50 \u2013 which tracks the most recent physical vintages for 12 leading prestige cuv\u00e9e Champagnes \u2013 has been the best-performing of Liv-ex\u2019s indices this year.Speaking about the retail market for Champagne during this pandemic year, and particularly the festive period, when much of Britain was under lockdown restrictions, Andrew Hawes, chairman of the country\u2019s Champagne Agents Association, as well as managing director of Mentzendorff \u2013 the importer for Bollinger and Ayala Champagnes in the UK \u2013 said the results were \u201castonishing\u201d.\u201cChampagne has always fallen in times of economic crisis and risen in times of recovery, so we expected it to follow that pattern, and it didn\u2019t,\u201d he said of this year\u2019s sales growth during the coronavirus crisis.In terms of Mentzendorff\u2019s sales for Bollinger and Ayala in UK retail, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got some fairly astonishing growth, and if you look at the figures, there is significant double digit growth for a number of brands, and it\u2019s not been achieved by discounting and dropping prices; the price has gone up, the volume has gone up, and the value has gone up.\u201dSuggesting that the retail growth may be even greater than the numbers from Nielsen suggest, he recorded major rises in Champagne sales in parts of the market not tracked by the data analyst.\u201cI don\u2019t believe that Amazon is in these numbers, and Amazon\u2019s Champagne sales are going through the roof; I know that from our own business, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not exclusive to Bollinger,\u201d he said.Suggesting that the trend of rising Champagne consumption at home in Britain at the height of pandemic was somewhat anomalous, he added, \u201cThe UK has performed better through Covid than other major markets.\u201dThis in turn has allowed Champagne brands to free up additional stock for the UK from other markets, helping to supply the increase in retail sales experienced in British retailers.Nevertheless, he said, \u201cAmazon still ran out of Bollinger in the run up to Christmas.\u201dWhile such sales trends are remarkable, it is not a cause for celebration, stressed Hawes.With Champagne consumption in pubs, bars, hotels and restaurants representing more than a third of sales in the UK, the growth in demand through retailers for drinking at home will not make up for the lost business in the hospitality sector due to coronavirus restrictions, which have seen the total closure of this part of the market for large parts of 2020.\u201cI would be surprised if we saw anything less than a double digit volume decline in Champagne shipments to the UK for this year if you take the on-trade into account,\u201d he said.Champagne sales in UK retail: the trends for 2020 (Nielsen UK off-trade reporting to w/e 26.12.2020)VolumeMAT to WE 26.12.2020 \u2013 Champagne +3% (Sparkling wine up 10%)12 weeks to WE 26.12.2020 \u2013 Champagne +13% (Sparkling wine up 10%)8 weeks to WE 26.12.2020 \u2013 Champagne +13% (Sparkling wine up 10%)4 weeks to WE 26.12.2020 \u2013 Champagne +13% (Sparkling wine up 9%)ValueMAT to WE 26.12.2020 \u2013 Champagne +8% (Sparkling wine up 12%)12 weeks to WE 26.12.2020 \u2013 Champagne +17% (Sparkling wine up 10%)8 weeks to WE 26.12.2020 \u2013 Champagne +14% (Sparkling wine up 10%)4 weeks to WE 26.12.2020 \u2013 Champagne +16% (Sparkling wine up 9%)Price per 75cl (\u00a3)MAT to WE 26.12.2020 \u2013 Champagne + 5.3% to \u00a325.15",

Photo: IC PhotoThe parent of liquor giant Kweichow Moutai Co. Ltd. has agreed to hand over part of its multi-billion-dollar stake in the Chinese mainland\u2019s most valuable listed company to a provincial government-owned investment vehicle. The price? Free.China Kweichow Moutai Winery Group Co. Ltd. (Moutai Group) is owned by the government of Southwest China\u2019s Guizhou province, one of the poorest in the country. The move illustrates how a local government can leverage a profitable state-owned enterprise (SOE) to address its own debt problems by helping its other SOEs.Moutai Group planned to transfer a 4% stake in Kweichow Moutai to Guizhou State-owned Capital Operation Co. Ltd. (\u8d35\u5dde\u7701\u56fd\u6709\u8d44\u672c\u8fd0\u8425\u6709\u9650\u8d23\u4efb\u516c\u53f8) at no cost, according to a Kweichow Moutai filing (link in Chinese) released on the Shanghai Stock Exchange late Wednesday. The shares to be transferred are valued around 92.5 billion yuan ($14.1 billion), based on Wednesday\u2019s closing price.After the deal, Moutai Group will remain Kweichow Moutai\u2019s controlling shareholder, retaining a 54% stake, the filing showed. Guizhou State-owned Capital will hold a 4.68% stake in the iconic liquor-maker.The deal comes amid rising market concerns over Guizhou\u2019s financial health as the province\u2019s SOEs face mounting debt repayment pressure. At an August meeting (link in Chinese), local government officials guaranteed that they would take measures to ensure that bonds issued by local companies will be repaid on time. Guizhou State-owned Capital, which is controlled by the Guizhou Provincial Finance Bureau, will purchase bonds issued by local government financing vehicles in a bid to boost market confidence, the officials said.Several bond investors said that while the stake transfer showed that the government was trying to address its debt problems, it will take time to assess how it will affect trading of bonds linked to the provincial government. The default of Yongcheng Coal and Electricity Holding Group Co. Ltd., a Henan province-based SOE, has had a major impact on market confidence, they said.It\u2019s the second time that Moutai Group has transferred a stake in this valuable subsidiary. Last December, the group announced it would transfer 4% in Kweichow Moutai to Guizhou State-owned Capital, which gradually sold off a majority of the stake for an estimated 71.2 billion yuan.At the end of 2019, the Guizhou provincial government had repayment obligations on 967.3 billion yuan of outstanding debt, the seventh-largest amount among the mainland\u2019s 31 provincial-level regions, according to a report (link in Chinese) by brokerage Guotai Junan Securities Co. Ltd. The debt overhang was equal to 146.3% of the provincial government\u2019s overall fiscal capacity, ranking at the top among the regions and far exceeding the 100% red line set by the Ministry of Finance.Han Wei contributed to this report.Contact reporter Tang Ziyi (ziyitang@caixin.com) and editor Michael Bellart (michaelbellart@caixin.com)Download our app to receive breaking news alerts and read the news on the go.",

            "description": "(Nikkei Asia) \u2014 Singapore\u2019s internet services group Sea, Chinese electric-vehicle maker BYD and e-commerce platform Pinduoduo were Asia\u2019s top three gainers in the stock market this year as investors flocked to companies that continued to grow throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.Thanks to worldwide monetary easing and fiscal stimuli that generated money for investment, global stock markets have recovered faster than real economies. Such a development created some high-flying Asian companies that investors hoped would become the next Tencent Holdings or Alibaba Group Holding \u2014 Asia\u2019s two most valuable companies, each now worth around $700 billion.The best example was Sea, known for its Shopee e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia. Its market capitalization grew more than fivefold this year to $102 billion, making it the region\u2019s most valuable listed company. That growth rate is No. 1 among about 500 major Asian companies that had a market cap of over $10 billion at the end of 2019, according to QUICK-FactSet data as of Dec. 22.Sea\u2019s three pillars \u2014 e-commerce, online gaming and e-payment \u2014 all benefited from the pandemic, and it continued aggressive marketing to capture market share. Being a rare Southeast Asian tech startup listed on the New York Stock Exchange, it attracted U.S. investors who see high growth potential in the region.Moreover, Sea won a digital bank license in Singapore earlier this month, which would unlock more fintech opportunities for the company, further boosting its shares.Similarly, Nasdaq-listed Pinduoduo, known for its generous group-buying discounts, is among a handful of Chinese e-commerce companies that benefited from surging demand during the pandemic, with its market cap nearly quadrupling to $170 billion.Online sales for the company remained strong even after the pandemic was largely contained in China. During the July-September quarter, Pinduoduo\u2019s revenue climbed 89% to 14.2 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) from a year earlier, and its net loss narrowed to 784.7 million yuan from 2.34 billion yuan in the same quarter last year.\u201cInformation technology was no doubt the best-performing sector in 2020, and this trend could carry into the next year because consumer behavior has been reshaped by Covid-related travel bans and lockdown measures,\u201d said Margaret Yang, a strategist with DailyFX in Singapore. \u201cThis could have a long-lasting impact on consumer behaviors and preferences.\u201dAsia\u2019s second-biggest gainer, BYD, increased its market capitalization by 333%. The Shenzhen-based automaker, which has had Warren Buffett\u2019s backing since 2008, has significantly improved its deliveries as China recovers strongly from the pandemic. In November, it more than doubled the sales of electric vehicles from a year ago, and now has the largest share in China\u2019s EV market.Investor confidence has also been boosted by a breakthrough in BYD\u2019s battery business. The Blade Battery it had been developing for years was launched in 2020. The battery can increase energy density by at least 30% and reduce costs of raw materials by 30%, according to the company.Other automobile-battery makers also made the list of top winners. China\u2019s Contemporary Amperex Technology had its market cap more than triple to $111 billion, while South Korea\u2019s LG Chem saw its value soar 2.5 times. LG Chem\u2019s market share in EV batteries jumped to 25% this year, from 12% a year ago, as it targeted Europe.Prospects are bright next year for LG Chem because the incoming administration of Joe Biden is expected to focus on the environment, which should raise demand for electric cars in the U.S.Globally, the stock performance of Tesla showed investors\u2019 high expectations of EVs, with its market value rising eightfold to over $600 billion, far exceeding that of Toyota Motor, Japan\u2019s most valuable company.The industrywide rally has also given rise to EV newcomers. The market cap of the Chinese EV startup Nio, which is not among the 500 major Asian companies because its market value was below $10 billion at the end of 2019, increased by 17 times to $74 billion \u2014 higher than General Motors \u2014 as its improved sales and delivery figures helped investor confidence.A few health care-related IT companies also gained significantly this year, with the shares of Hong Kong-listed Alibaba Health Information Technology rising 219% and Japan\u2019s medical information platform M3 soaring 179%.After a plunge in March as the pandemic spread across the world and governments halted economic activities, stock prices have been on an upward trajectory since April after infections peaked in many countries.The Nasdaq composite index climbed 43% this year, while South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei Stock Average rose 24% and 12%. The Shanghai Composite Index also rose, by 10%. The Nikkei Asia300 index, which covers major stocks in Asia outside Japan, gained 17%.However, Southeast Asian markets, which do not hold many high-flying tech listings, generally underperformed, with Thailand\u2019s SET down 10%.Five Asian companies made the list of the world\u2019s 20 most valuable companies: Tencent (No. 7), Alibaba (8), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (12), Samsung Electronics (13) and Chinese liquor maker Kweichow Moutai (17). There were only four Asian companies in the top 20 at the end of 2019. TSMC and Kweichow Moutai are new entrants; Industrial and Commercial Bank of China fell off the list.Some Asian companies rode on the stock market boom to go public this year, making blockbuster initial public offerings. China\u2019s KE Holdings, which listed on the NYSE in August \u2014 the biggest IPO by a Chinese company in the U.S. this year \u2014 is now valued at nearly $80 billion, almost eight times its value when Tencent and SoftBank Group invested in the company last year.The company, also known as Beike Zhaofang, is the mainland\u2019s biggest online real estate transaction platform, earning revenues primarily from commission fees. Investors have been attracted to the company\u2019s business model, as it charges as much as a 3% commission on home sales while keeping overhead costs lower than under those for traditional property agencies. The company\u2019s adjusted net profit more than tripled to 1.86 billion yuan in the quarter ended September.Meanwhile, Asian companies in traditional sectors like energy and transportation lost significant market value this year as their core businesses were hit hard by travel curbs and other pandemic restrictions. The market value of Japanese oil giant INPEX and Chinese state oil major CNOOC fell by 52% and 44% respectively, while that of West Japan Railway declined 47%.Some analysts believe the bull run is not over. \u201cThe upward trajectory remains intact for the global stock market, albeit some technical pullbacks are possible into the first quarter of 2021,\u201d Yang said.She pointed out that stock market valuations appear to be \u201coverstretched\u201d but the accommodative monetary environment and hopes about vaccines may continue to support a bull market in the medium term.She said U.S. President-elect Biden could bring major changes to America\u2019s foreign policy alongside tax reforms. \u201cAside from that, the lingering impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, an uneven rollout of Covid vaccines around the globe and the ongoing U.S.-China spat are among the key event risks.\u201dAdditional reporting by Nikki Sun and Narayanan Somasundaram in Hong Kong and Kim Jaewon in Seoul.This article was originally published by Nikkei AsiaContact editor Yang Ge (geyang@caixin.com)Download our app to receive breaking news alerts and read the news on the go.",

            "description": "The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is delaying the trial in the 2008 Malegaon blast case and not us, advocate JP Mishra, lawyer of BJP MP Sadhvi Pragya Thakur, said on Saturday. This comes after a special NIA court in Mumbai, earlier today, expressed unhappiness over the absence of all the accused during the hearing and again directed all the accused persons to physically appear before the court on the next hearing on January 4.\"It is the NIA which is delaying the trial and not us. if they allege that case is delayed due to the absence of the accused, then let them show examples when we have sought adjournment on basis of absence,\" Mishra told reporters here. Mishra was responding to the allegations of Sameer Kulkarni, who is another accused in the case. Earlier, Kulkarni had reportedly said that it is sad that other accused in the case including Sadhvi Pragya are delaying the trial by seeking exemptions.Notably, four out of the seven accused were present before the court. Three accused persons, including Sadhvi Pragya Thakur, Lt Col Prasad Purohit and Sudhakar Chaturvedi did not appear before the special NIA court today. Applications for exemption from today's hearing were filed before the court by their lawyers. Mishra, during the hearing, appraised the court that all arrangements were made for Pragya's travel to Mumbai including her stay at a government guest house in order to attend the hearing, however, she was admitted to AIIMS, Delhi for treatment after the advice from her doctors, and could not come to Mumbai.Speaking to ANI, he said, \"It is the NIA, which only brings one witness in every hearing, whose statement and cross-questioning gets over in an hour or less than that. Let the NIA bring four to five witnesses a day. Then, we can expect expedited proceedings. Who has stopped NIA from bringing more witnesses so that the court can function for longer?\" Apart from Thakur, LT Col Purohit, Chaturvedi and Kulkarni, Ajay Rahirkar, retired Major Ramesh Upadhyay and Sudhakar Dwivedi are also accused in the case.They have been charged under various sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), the Explosive Substances Act and the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The charges include Sections 16 (committing terrorist act) and 18 (conspiring to commit terrorist act) of the UAPA and Sections 120(b) (criminal conspiracy), 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 153(a) (promoting enmity between two religious groups) of the IPC.Six people were killed and over 100 injured when an explosive device strapped to a motorcycle went off near a mosque in Malegaon, a town in north Maharashtra, on September 29, 2008.

            "description": "By Sophie Yu and Brenda GohBEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - As luxury spending rebounds in China, consumers with money to burn have a new habit beyond fancy bags and watches: a taste for collector editions of fiery domestic liquor Moutai, not to drink but to hold onto as a rapidly appreciating investment.Amid China's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, Moutai buyers like Beijing tech worker Yang Nan have seen re-sale prices for vintage and limited editions of the 'baijiu' spirit made by Kweichow Moutai rocket as demand booms. And they want in on the action, before it's too late.\"I feel more people are getting into the market of Moutai collection and making it more difficult for people like me to afford it,\" Yang told Reuters. The 30-year-old hails from the southwestern province of Guizhou, home of Moutai, and was raised to know the drink's value: her parents sold 12 bottles to raise 250,000 yuan ($38,000) for a downpayment for her apartment in the capital.A special 'Year of the Rat' bottle that Yang purchased for 1,699 yuan at the start of 2019 is now worth almost double, about 3,000 yuan, according to e-commerce giant Alibaba's Taobao marketplace - typical for the general growth in prices that are now their highest on record, drinks specialists say.Kweichow Moutai tightly controls the supply of its drinks, with retail prices starting around 1,500 yuan for bottles that have for years been the tipple of choice for China's elite government and business circles. It nurtures a luxury image in the country's giant baijiu sector, with a market value of more than $300 billion - the most valuable listed company in China.But demand for vintage bottles beyond the company's retail reach has reached dizzy heights this year, analysts and shopkeepers say, thanks to a flood of new buyers seeking safe-haven investments during pandemic uncertainty.\"Recently the overall economic environment was bad, anything that has a potential to increase in value is popular,\" said independent liquor industry analyst Cai Xuefei. Fine international wines and spirits have long been a target for wealthier Chinese.Story continues\"Moutai is not only for drinking, it is a social tool, an identity indicator. As people believe older Moutai will be only more valuable, there is little risk in hoarding (bottles).\"The rampant prices have also now lured many liquor stores into trading collector bottles. Cai estimates as many as 20% of shops in China that were not previously in the market piled in during the COVID-19 outbreak.Bricks-and-mortar stores are also trusted more by some customers as less likely to sell fake Moutai, on which police have cracked down in recent years.Kweichow Moutai did not respond to repeated phone calls from Reuters.'MAKES ME COUGH'Investment options available to the Chinese public are limited due to stringent controls on outbound money transfers. Valuations on alternatives like property or the stock market have been curbed by government controls or previous burst bubbles.\"The financial feature of Moutai as an investment became obvious to many during the pandemic, and the price of old Moutai moved up stably and now stands at a historical high,\" said Guangzhou-based independent analyst Zhu Danpeng.Moutai's drinks, consumed neat, often downed in shots, firstly sell fast in the primary market, even at already hefty prices.Its signature Feitian 53 range - known as 'Flying Fairy', with 53% alcohol by volume - starts at 1,499 yuan is heavily traded by speculators. Last year, U.S. retailer Costco sold out a stock of 10,000 bottles in just two days, at the opening of its first China outlet in Shanghai.But Moutai also makes special edition, colourful bottles, like the annual Chinese zodiac range, and even a memorial bottle named after Hong Kong action movie star Jackie Chan that it rolled out in 2012.The company lost some of its lustre during a high-profile anti-corruption drive by President Xi Jinping launched in 2012 that reined in lavish entertainment spending by businesses and government officials.But Moutai bounced back after an internal clean-up that saw some top executives arrested and a revamp of its distribution network.For some consumers and collectors, the high-alcohol liquor has always been difficult to drink - and the increasing prices only add to their reluctance to do so.\"I don't like the strong taste. It makes me cough,\" said Beijing buyer Yang, adding that she tended to prefer champagne or wine.\"It's more and more difficult to afford but the good thing is the value of my collection is rising.\"($1 = 6.5759 Chinese yuan renminbi)(Reporting by Sophie Yu in Beijing and Brenda Goh in Shanghai; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)",

The spirit of Nereides is inexorably linked to the history of the nobility and its two hometowns, Paris and Capri. Nereides' personal and professional journey is both atypical and complex.It is currently difficult to define an ordinary profile when it comes to a man who masters several apparently opposed fields, from finance to haute couture, passing through multiple professional experiences and unexpected and sometimes incomprehensible choices.Nereides lives and works between Paris and Capri, and he also lived in Florence for a few years. With a dual humanist and legal track record at the same time, and a confirmed experience in the haute couture, Nereides has always mixed science with philosophy, economics with art, law with fashion.Entrepreneur, couturier, philosopher, poet, economist, painter, journalist ... a thousand faces of a mysterious and impenetrable character, sober and not at all eccentric, who oscillates between two opposing worlds: the austerity of finance and international diplomacy, and the ephemeral beauty of art and haute couture.The common thread of his life is revealed to be his creativity, which he uses with versatility, whether it is a financial transaction or the design of a new haute couture collection for his own Parisian Maison.Since the youngest age, Nereides has worked on international projects, from the oil sector to real estate, from the art deal sector to financial trading, including various experiences in the marketing and trade sector in luxury houses, such as Chanel and Fendi for example, or others from the LVMH group.However, his artistic creativity has been developed alongside his entrepreneurial experience and fashion has always been one of his privileged fields.In 2007, he founded the haute couture house NEREIDES in Place Vend\u00f4me, his personal address, where he organizes private shows and he returns each year to his native island, Capri, where he often exhibits his creations during the summer.The same year, he consolidated an artistic and professional partnership with the Italian photographer and artist Lello Ammirati who became the Artistic Director of his House as well as his alter ego.Over the past 13 years, many celebrities and personalities of the international jet set have been captivated by the charm of NEREIDES haute couture creations which are characterized by timeless elegance and sensuality.The particularity of NEREIDES creations lies in the craftsmanship, the preciousness of the materials and the uniqueness of each piece.Each year, Nereides creates a small number of creations for a limited audience and each creation requires long weeks of work.Some of the materials used include diamonds and gemstones for hand embroidery, fur and exotic leathers.There are some muses who inspire the artistic evolution of the creator. Among them, actresses such as Nicole Kidmann, Angelina Jolie, Cate Blanchett, passing by models: the Italian model and actress Lilly Mandel who has been nicknamed the \"new Monica Bellucci\", the Parisian Marine Barbier and the model Mame Anta Wada already muse of the famous singer Rihanna.NEREIDES is also known for the production of men's haute couture and for unique high jewelry creations. Today, it is more and more difficult to become a part of the small clientele of this niche House for which Nereides personally chooses its members.Along with the passion for sewing and art, Nereides continues to work successfully in the financial field and from 2020 he joins forces with new business partners becoming the new Global Chief Marketing and Investor Relations Officer of Bellagraph Nova Group.The meeting with the founders of the BN group, Evangeline Shen and Nelson Loh, consolidates a new professional adventure for Nereides who sees himself at the head of an international conglomerate of more than thirty companies ranging from the financial trading sector to asset management. , from the medical and hospital sector to cosmetics, from robotics to fine jewelry with a team of over 23,000 employees. In August 2020, Nereides leads negotiations for the acquisition of the British football team Newcastle which the Bellagraph Nova Group wishes to buy and he plans a five-year marketing strategy which sees the creation of a new film production house, Papillon Media Production. , and his official debut in the world of cinema starting at the Venice Film Festival in September 2020 and its participation in international festivals such as the Golden Globe Awards and the Cannes Film Festival. Nereides then signs a partnership between Bellagraph Nova Group and Valentina Castellani-Quinn, founder and president of Quinn Studios Entertainment in Los Angeles for the production of films in Hollywood as well as short films for the online shopping market. Papillon Media Production is the very first international media content creation platform for brands and influencers who wish to sell their products or third-party products online on Chinese platforms.Creativity never ceases to inspire Nereides who is always open to new adventures and who touches with its daring and modernity.NEREIDES website:Bellagraph Nova Group10, Place Vend\u00f4me75001 ParisFRANCEbnmedia@bellagraphnovagroup.comBellagraph Nova Group is an international financial Group founded on 2020 in Paris",

Dans la plupart des provinces et des villes, il est interdit aux fonctionnaires de boire sur leur lieu de travail pendant les heures de bureau et lors de toutes les activit\u00e9s officielles, qu'il s'agisse de conf\u00e9rences ou de d\u00eeners d\u2019affaires.Une mesure des plus s\u00e9v\u00e8resCependant, cette nouvelle interdiction impos\u00e9e par quelques villes dans le nord-ouest de la province de Gansu, l'est de la province de Jiangsu, le centre de la province du Henan et dans la province de Qinghai, va plus loin. Elle interdira aux fonctionnaires de consommer de l'alcool m\u00eame apr\u00e8s les heures de travail, rendant l\u2019interdiction, de ce fait, totale. Une annonce faite par le gouvernement de Qingcheng dans la province de Gansu, au nord-ouest de la Chine, interdit explicitement le service de toute boisson alcoolis\u00e9e et la consommation de toute boisson alcoolis\u00e9e fournie par toute entreprise ou tout individu lors de toute fonction officielle. L'interdiction stipule \u00e9galement que les fonctionnaires n\u2019ont plus le droit de consommer de l'alcool, qu'ils soient au travail, en vacances ou en service, et m\u00eame en dehors de la journ\u00e9e de travail de huit heures.La province de Nanyang, dans le Henan, au centre de la Chine, a mis en \u0153uvre une interdiction du m\u00eame ordre. \u00c0 Nanjing, capitale de la province du Jiangsu, les policiers seront amen\u00e9s \u00e0 faire preuve de sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 aussi. En effet, le commissariat interdit aux forces de l\u2019ordre de consommer de l\u2019alcool en semaine \u00ab sauf dans des circonstances particuli\u00e8res et sous r\u00e9serve d\u2019autorisation des services comp\u00e9tents. La consommation d'alcool est interdite les jours ouvrables \u00bb. \u00c0 Menyuan, dans la province de Qinghai, pr\u00e8s du Tibet, le gouvernement local a instaur\u00e9 une interdiction syst\u00e9matique des boissons alcooliques. Elle interdit formellement aux fonctionnaires de consommer de l'alcool \u00ab pour quelque raison que ce soit \u00bb pendant les jours de travail.Le baijiu, premi\u00e8re victime ?Malgr\u00e9 cette interdiction stricte sur le papier, il reste \u00e0 savoir si elle est r\u00e9ellement applicable et contr\u00f4lable. \u00ab Comment pouvez-vous v\u00e9rifier leur consommation d'alcool apr\u00e8s les heures de travail, une fois \u00e0 la maison ? En les suivant chez eux ? \u00bb s\u2019est moqu\u00e9 un utilisateur Weibo. D'autres commentaires en ligne se sont focalis\u00e9s sur ce qui pourrait devenir la principale victime de cette interdiction : il s\u2019agit, non pas des fonctionnaires eux-m\u00eames, mais plut\u00f4t de la marque de baijiu la plus pris\u00e9e en Chine, Kweichow Moutai, dont les ventes et la valeur boursi\u00e8re pourraient en p\u00e2tir. Ce spiritueux fougueux \u00e9labor\u00e9 dans la province de Guizhou au sud-ouest de la Chine, figure parmi les nectars pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s des fonctionnaires chinois.Avec des origines profond\u00e9ment r\u00e9volutionnaires, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 servi au Pr\u00e9sident am\u00e9ricain Richard Nixon lors de son premier voyage en Chine. Henry Kissinger, alors secr\u00e9taire d'\u00c9tat am\u00e9ricain, a plaisant\u00e9 un jour avec le chef supr\u00eame de la Chine, Deng Xiaoping : \u00ab Si nous buvons assez de Moutai, nous pourrons r\u00e9soudre tous les probl\u00e8mes ! \u00bb Ses origines et son immense popularit\u00e9 parmi les hommes d'affaires et amateurs chinois l'ont propuls\u00e9 au rang de marque d'alcool la mieux valoris\u00e9e au monde, devant la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 britannique Diageo.",

            "description": "Fiery grain liquor and highway maintenance are strange bedfellows. But the unusual matchup is precisely what the Chinese government has orchestrated by tapping booze maker Kweichow Moutai to rescue a state-owned highway operator through a massive bond issuance.The state-owned parent of China\u2019s most valuable listed company, which is based in the impoverished southwestern province of Guizhou, plans to issue up to 15 billion yuan ($2.2 billion) in bonds to help Guizhou Expressway pay off its debts, with proceeds from the bond sale going towards buying a stake in the highway operator. The company\u2019s shares plunged by almost 7% this week after the company filed documents to the bourse for approval.AdvertisementAs the world\u2019s biggest liquor maker by market value, Kweichow Moutai has leapfrogged other international alcohol firms like Britain\u2019s Diageo and and Belgium\u2019s AB InBev, even though few people outside China have heard of the brand until recently. Fewer still have acquired a taste for its pricey, colorless, burn-in-your-throat liquor. Kweichow Moutai is the biggest constituent (pdf) of the MSCI China stock index, the first index to allow a broad base of foreign investors to buy into the Chinese stock market, and is heavily traded in the stock exchange linkage between Hong Kong and Shanghai. But tapping a publicly listed company to bail out a state-owned enterprise may not augur well for its shareholders.Because Kweichow Moutai is hugely profitable, it\u2019s under constant pressure from the highly indebted provincial government of Guizhou to \u201cmake contributions,\u201d said Zhigang Tao, a professor of economics at the University of Hong Kong. \u201cWhile this kind of multi-tasking effort is good for the province and some of its money-losing business, it is bad news for the shareholders of Moutai\u201d unless the company rewarded in kind by the government with perks like greater monopoly power, licensing rights, and market access.\u201cAs one of the most, if not the most [valuable] SOEs in China, the government has gotten into a habit of relying on largess from Moutai,\u201d said Victor Shih, an expert on China\u2019s political economy and a professor at University of California, San Diego. \u201cLast year, Moutai had to transfer 4% of its shares to the Guizhou government at no cost. For senior managers in Moutai, however, helping the government may well have an impact on their careers especially after the share transfer which made both the local and central governments major shareholders of the company.\u201dArrangements like these are also reminders that China\u2019s private companies, besides being guided by profits, must also exist to serve the Communist Party. As Tao has previously written (paywall), state-owned companies \u201care the favorite kids of the socialist government of China,\u201d while private firms are the \u201cso-called adopted kids facing systematic discriminations and substantial constraints in business entries and subsequent operations.\u201dAdvertisementThough the Guizhou government will implicitly owe Moutai a favor, in the short run the firm\u2019s shareholders have little to gain, said Aris Stouraitis, a professor at the Hong Kong Baptist University\u2019s department of finance and decision sciences. \u201cMost likely it is bad for shareholders, even in the long run. This favor that the market might expect might not materialize.\u201dStouraitis also pointed that it\u2019s not unusual for companies within the same corporate group to lend money to each other, in what is known as an intra-group loan. While Kweichow Moutai and Guizhou Expressway don\u2019t share a corporate umbrella, both have the state as a controlling shareholder, making Moutai\u2019s bond issuance somewhat akin to an intra-group loan. And as with any loans, there is a risk of default, of which, said Stouraitis, there are many cases.",

The first billboard in Pompeo\u2019s view as he exited the Paramaribo airport was an advertisement for China\u2019s potent Kweichow Moutai liquor with an image of the Forbidden City.",

            "description": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 Surging demand for butler-like concierge service at the millions of condominiums in China is creating one of the hottest sectors in the nation\u2019s stock market.Property management companies, providing everything from childcare to shopping errands for residents in China\u2019s densely populated communities, have soared this year as the pandemic kept workers at home.Ever Sunshine Lifestyle Services Group Ltd., spun off from Cifi Holdings Group Co., has almost tripled this year. Yincheng Life Service Co. has surged more than 400%, while Times Neighborhood Holdings Ltd. has doubled. Overall, housing service stocks in Hong Kong have jumped 60% on average, topping the 47% rise by Chinese consumer stocks in Shanghai and the 29% gain for technology firms.\u201cThe sector has become highly favored by investors, almost like they\u2019re consumer or tech stocks,\u201d said CGS-CIMB Securities property analyst Raymond Cheng. \u201cWe have seen global funds from Singapore to the U.S. piling onto it.\u201dChina\u2019s highly indebted property developers are taking note, seizing on the rally to list their service arms in Hong Kong and raise money to pare debt. Thirteen Chinese developers have started or flagged intentions to spin off their management units this year, a record since 2017 when the trend emerged.A dense neighborhood in China can have as many as 100,000 condominiums, creating a captive market for versatile services. Residents \u2014 especially the elderly and those with young children \u2014 are increasingly using these butlers to buy groceries and medicine, rent out their investment properties, or even babysit their children.While listings picked up about two years ago when the property arm of Country Garden Holdings Co., the nation\u2019s largest residential builder, started trading in Hong Kong, the major valuation boost has come this year.Spinning off property management units gives developers much needed funding, especially as they face the biggest liquidity test in more than four years. China Evergrande Group, the nation\u2019s most-leveraged major developer, and Sunac China Holdings Ltd. last month joined smaller rivals in announcing listing plans.Evergrande\u2019s addition of strategic investors into its privately-held services unit, a move widely seen as a pre-listing move, has helped the developer lower its net debt to equity by 19 percentage points, President Xia Haijun said on an earnings call last month.\u201cFor developers, both their financial pressure and splendid valuations of service firms lure them to the wave of IPOs,\u201d said Kristy Hung, property analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cFor those debt-laden builders, having one more listed entity means more versatile fund-raising channels.\u201dUnlike developers that face uncertainties from a cyclical slowdown and government restrictions, the property management business is shielded from China\u2019s property curbs. Its advantages include a stable model with recurring fee revenue and low leverage.Investors also like the growth outlook, as sprawling new apartments built by their parent developers translate into new business. The bigger players are also on a fast expansion track by swallowing smaller rivals.\u201cIt\u2019s an attractive, long-term investment opportunity that only exists in China, \u201d said CGS-CIMB\u2019s Cheng, who estimates the industry\u2019s market value will quadruple to $180 billion by 2025. \u201cNo other country has so much floor area to manage.\u201dYincheng Life rose another 4.1% in Hong Kong morning trading Monday, bringing gains this year to 405%. Ever Sunshine was up 3.4%.Still, the stock surge has pushed valuations well above the property parents, raising concerns about stretched prices. At least 10 companies trade at more than 47 times trailing 12-month earnings, in line with Kweichow Moutai Co., the spirits-maker that\u2019s one of China\u2019s most loved stocks.\u201cThe sector\u2019s share prices may come under pressure in the next two to three months,\u201d China International Capital Corp. analyst Eric Zhang wrote in a report. \u201cThe slew of upcoming IPOs will likely dilute investors\u2019 funds. And as earnings season passes, there isn\u2019t much catalyst left in the short term.\u201dContact editor Yang Ge (geyang@caixin.com)Support quality journalism in China.

You\u2019re searching for what to do in this frightening situation.Watkins Ward Group Investigations deal with these inquiries almost daily....Don\u2019t panic. Contrary to the claims in your email, you haven't been hacked (or at least, that's not what prompted that email).This is merely a new variation on an old scam which is popularly being called \"sextortion.\" This is a type of online phishing that is targeting people around the world and preying on digital-age fears.We have pasted an example of these emails at the bottom of this post. The general gist is that a hacker claims to have compromised your computer and says they will release embarrassing information\u2014such as images of you captured through your web camera or your pornographic browsing history\u2014to your friends, family, and co-workers. The hacker promises to go away if you send them thousands of pounds, usually with bitcoin.What makes the email especially alarming is that, to prove their authenticity, they begin the emails showing you a password you once used or currently use.Again, this still doesn't mean you've been hacked. The scammers in this case likely matched up a database of emails and stolen passwords and sent this scam out to potentially millions of people, hoping that enough of them would be worried enough and pay out that the scam would become profitable.Watkins Ward Group Investigations researched some of the bitcoin wallets being used by the scammers. Of the five wallets we looked at only one had received any bitcoin, in total about 0.5 bitcoin or \u00a34,000 at the time of this writing. It\u2019s hard to say how much the scammers have received in total at this point since they appear to be using different bitcoin addresses for each attack, but it\u2019s clear that at least some people are already falling for this scam.Here are some quick answers to the questions many people ask after receiving these emails.They have my password! How did they get my password?Unfortunately, in the modern age, data breaches are common and massive sets of passwords make their way to the criminal corners of the Internet. Scammers likely obtained such a list for the express purpose of including a kernel of truth in an otherwise boilerplate mass email.If the password emailed to you is one that you still use, in any context whatsoever, STOP USING IT and change it NOW! And regardless of whether or not you still use that password it's always a good idea to use a postcode manager.And of course, you should always change your password when you\u2019re alerted that your information has been leaked in a breach. You can also use a service like Have I Been Pwned to check whether you have been part of one of the more well-known password dumps.Should I respond to the email?Absolutely not. With this type of scam, the perpetrator relies on the likelihood that a small number of people will respond out of a batch of potentially millions. Fundamentally this isn't that much different from the old Nigerian prince scam, just with a different hook. By default they expect most people will not even open the email, let alone read it. But once they get a response\u2014and a conversation is initiated\u2014they will likely move into a more advanced stage of the scam. It\u2019s better to not respond at all.So, I shouldn\u2019t pay the ransom?You should not pay the ransom. If you pay the ransom, you\u2019re not only losing money but you\u2019re encouraging the scammers to continue phishing other people. If you do pay, then the scammers may also use that as a pressure point to continue to blackmail you, knowing that you\u2019re susceptible.What should I do instead?As we said before, for sure stop using the password that the scammer used in the phishing email, and consider employing a password manager to keep your passwords strong and unique. Moving forward, you should make sure to enable two-factor authentication whenever that is an option on your online accounts. You can also check out the Watkins Ward Group Surveillance Self-Defense guide for more tips on how to protect your security and privacy online.One other thing to do to protect yourself is apply a cover over your computer\u2019s camera. We offer some through our store, but a small strip of electrical tape will do.We know this experience isn't fun, but it's also not the end of the world. Just ignore the scammers' empty threats and practice good password hygiene going forward!Watkins Ward Group - sex scam example;''I am aware one of your passphrase: password. Lets get directly to point. Not a single person has compensated me to investigate about you. You do not know me and you are probably wondering why you're getting this e mail?actually, I actually installed a software on the adult vids (sex sites) site and you know what, you visited this web site to have fun (you know what I mean). When you were viewing videos, your internet browser initiated working as a Remote control Desktop that has a key logger which provided me access to your display screen and also web cam. Right after that, my software program collected your complete contacts from your Messenger, FB, and email . After that I created a double-screen video. 1st part shows the video you were viewing (you've got a good taste haha . . .), and 2nd part shows the view of your webcam, and its u.You do have only 2 alternatives. We are going to understand these types of choices in aspects:1st solution is to disregard this message. In this case, I am going to send your actual video clip to just about all of your contacts and thus you can easily imagine about the disgrace you feel. Not to mention should you be in a relationship, just how it will eventually affect?Number two choice will be to pay me $3000. We will think of it as a donation. As a consequence, I most certainly will without delay eliminate your videotape. You will keep going on your daily life like this never happened and you will not hear back again from me.You'll make the payment through Bitcoin (if you do not know this, search for \"how to buy bitcoin\" in Google).''Watkins Ward Limited83, Ducie StreetManchesterM1 2JQPress contact; Brian Sladdenbrian@local-detective.co.uk0800 233 5711Watkins Ward Group Investigations is a UK nation-wide group of Private Investigators.

            "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The surging U.S. stock market is a problem for money managers, and relief can\u2019t come soon enough.The S&P 500 Index has reclaimed its pre-coronavirus peak and is notching fresh records almost daily, yet few managers are celebrating. Sure, the money they oversee is growing, but not fast enough for investors aching to keep up with a runaway U.S. stock market.The market rally, and the fear of missing out it arouses, is disrupting the delicate balance managers must strike between protecting money and growing it. Managers safeguard the money entrusted to them by spreading their bets. But when the U.S. stock market surges, it tends to be the only bet investors care about. And that\u2019s when diversification can quickly take a backseat to chasing the market.Building guardrails around a portfolio isn\u2019t free, but the cost has historically been bearable. A traditional diversified portfolio made up of 60% U.S. stocks and 40% long-term bonds blended equally between government and corporate debt has generated 9% a year since 1926, including dividends. That\u2019s 1.2 percentage points a year less than the S&P 500, but with roughly a third less volatility, a common measure of risk.The explosion in new investments in recent decades promised to further reduce the cost of protection. Money managers can now assemble portfolios in a dizzying number of combinations by reaching for foreign stocks and bonds, hedge funds or private assets\u2014 and all in a variety of investing styles. And most have. Today\u2019s portfolios are far more diversified than a traditional 60/40 one, which in theory should produce similar or higher returns with less risk.But just the opposite has happened in recent years. The U.S. stock market has outpaced most other investments, so the more managers diversified their portfolios, the more they lagged the market. A 60/40 portfolio of global stocks and bonds has returned a respectable 8.4% annually over the past five years, but also a heartbreaking 6.2 percentage points a year less than the S&P 500. And that\u2019s probably the best case. Those who also dabbled in value stocks, small companies, hedge funds or energy-related real assets fared even worse.Story continuesWhat happened? The fault is in the stocks. A handful of them have performed spectacularly in recent years while the rest have stalled or worse. There are roughly 9,000 companies in indexes that track the broad global stock market, but just 30 of them produced more than 70% of the total gain over the past five years, more than half of them U.S. companies. Ten stocks \u2014 Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. in the U.S.; Alibaba Group, Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Kweichow Moutai Co. in China; Shopify Inc. in Canada; and Magazine Luiza SA in Brazil \u2014 were responsible for more than 50% of the gain. And amazingly, just three \u2014 Amazon, Apple and Microsoft \u2014 contributed 25% of the gain.Crises tend to level the playing field, but Covid-19 has only widened the disparity between the handful of winners and the horde of laggards. The e-commerce and internet giants have thrived during the pandemic while many other businesses languished, which has further ballooned their market value relative to the field and thereby increased their representation in broad market indexes. Apple, Microsoft and Amazon, the three biggest stocks in the S&P 500 by market value, now account for a whopping 18% of the index. While they continue to soar, good luck keeping up with the market without a sizable stake in those stocks.Stock funds have paid a harsh penalty for lightening up on the behemoths or sidestepping them altogether. That includes hedge funds, actively managed mutual funds and index funds that stray from the broad market. The HFRI Equity Hedge Total Index \u2014 an index of long-short equity hedge funds \u2014 has trailed the S&P 500 by 7.5 percentage points a year over the last five years through July, well below its average outperformance of 0.4 percentage points a year relative to the S&P 500 over rolling five-year periods since 1990. And of the roughly 10,000 equity and alternative U.S. mutual funds with a five-year track record, just 17% beat the S&P 500 over the past five years, according to numbers compiled by Morningstar. Not all those mutual funds invest in U.S. stocks, but the results show how difficult it has been to keep up with the U.S. stock market regardless of the strategy.Managers of diversified portfolios fared no better, mainly because stocks or stock funds account for a substantial portion, if not most, of their portfolios. Of the roughly 3,700 balanced U.S. mutual funds with a five-year record, just two managed to beat the S&P 500 over the last five years. And as a group, they lagged the S&P 500 by an average of 7.2 percentage points a year during the period, well higher than the toll historically paid by traditional 60/40 portfolios for straying from the S&P 500.Even the most sophisticated managers of diversified portfolios have struggled to keep up. Of the 38 university endowments tracked by Bloomberg that have reported performance through fiscal year 2019, all of which oversee a bounty of more than $1 billion, not one beat the S&P 500 over the previous five years \u2014 not even the mighty Harvard and Yale endowments, despite the talent and resources their collective $71 billion affords them. They trailed the S&P 500 by 5.1 percentage points and 1.9 percentage points a year, respectively.Many diversified portfolios would have suffered even more if not for the success of bonds and private equity. Long-term government and corporate bonds each returned more than 10% a year during the past five years, nearly twice their long-term average, as interest rates fell to near zero. And while private equity delivered more muted returns than investors are used to, it still outpaced the S&P 500 by 2.5 percentage points a year over five years through March 2020, according to the Cambridge Associates U.S. Private Equity Index. But those tailwinds are likely to vanish in the years ahead. Interest rates have little room to fall further and private equity is awash with money chasing too few deals, which is stretching valuations and compromising future returns.All of this leaves managers with a discomfiting choice: stick with a balanced portfolio or chase the S&P 500. The last time they faced such a quandary was during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s. Those who stuck with their diversified portfolios lost clients who were desperate to keep up with the market. And those who chased the market lost clients, and much of their money, when internet stocks tumbled in the early 2000s, dragging the market down with them. Managers don\u2019t often face such a choice.

Sex ist das Thema, und deshalb ist Sex-Expertin Paula Lambert zum M\u00e4delsabend geladen - diesmal tats\u00e4chlich eine Pyjama-Party, auf der es nur um das Eine geht. Sexualit\u00e4t habe immer mit Status und Selbstwahrnehmung zu tun, sagt Paula Lambert, denn \"ein vitales Sexleben hei\u00dft ja auch: Ich bin jung, ich bin frisch, ich werde begehrt. Und wenn Sex fehlt, dreht das die emotionale Gemengelage um - ich werde abgewiesen, ich werde nicht geliebt, ich bin kein bisschen begehrenswert\". Sex bestimme also ganz sch\u00f6n viel, obwohl er n\u00fcchtern betrachtet doch nur \"ein Bruchteil von dem ist, was uns allein und als Paar ausmacht\". Dennoch w\u00fcnscht sich die 46-J\u00e4hrige, dass mehr \u00fcber Sex gesprochen wird und zwar bitte konkret: \"62 Prozent aller Frauen kommen nicht w\u00e4hrend der Penetration. Schlimmer: Vier von f\u00fcnf dieser Frauen nehmen das stillschweigend hin, anstatt ihrem Partner zu sagen: Du, so geht das nicht, das funktioniert nicht f\u00fcr mich.\" F\u00fcr Lambert gipfelt das auch in einer grunds\u00e4tzlichen Frage an die j\u00fcngeren, scheinbar emanzipierten Generationen: \"Wie sehen Frauen eigentlich ihre eigene Sexualit\u00e4t, was ist sie f\u00fcr sie?\"",

            "description": "Come investire in Cina?L\u2019economia cinese: tutto quello che c\u2019\u00e8 da sapere La Cina \u00e8 la seconda economia al mondo in termini di prodotto interno lordo (PIL) e si prevede che tra non molto superer\u00e0 anche Stati Uniti. Il PIL cinese \u00e8 di gran lunga superiore se misurato con la parit\u00e0 di potere d'acquisto.Nonostante le sue dimensioni e l\u2019influenza che questo d\u00e0 al paese sulla scena mondiale, la Cina continua a crescere oltre il doppio del tasso medio del resto del mondo, guadagnandosi cos\u00ec il titolo di motore della crescita globale. La crescita \u00e8 stata cos\u00ec forte che negli ultimi 30 anni ( dall\u2019apertura e le riforme del 1978) la quota della Cina nell\u2019economia mondiale \u00e8 salita da meno del 2% ad oltre il 16% di oggi.\u00c8 il ruolo della Cina come fabbrica mondiale ( oltre un quinto di tutto il manifatturiero) che ha guidato l\u2019espansione del paese.La crescita annuale della Cina ha registrato una media di oltre il 10% negli ultimi tre decenni, ma negli ultimi anni si \u00e8 registrato un significativo rallentamento. La crescita del 6.1% registrata nel 2019 \u00e8 stata la pi\u00f9 lenta mai vista dal 1990 e le previsioni del Fondo monetario Internazionale (FMI) parlano di un prossimo futuro rallentamento.La Cina sta trasformando la sua economia...L'espansione dell'economia cinese \u00e8 stata finora trainata da beni a basso costo per la produzione di manodopera che vengono poi esportati nel resto del mondo. Tuttavia, tale pratica \u00e8 stata a lungo considerata insostenibile e responsabile della creazione di squilibri economici, sociali e ambientali. Ad esempio, secondo il FMI, gli investimenti rappresentano ancora il 45% del PIL, oltre il doppio di quello degli Stati Uniti. Il PIL pro capite \u00e8 ancora basso, ovvero poco pi\u00f9 di 15,000 dollari rispetto ai quasi 50,000 dollari per le economie avanzate, e il Paese \u00e8 il principale responsabile per l\u2019inquinamento al mondo, emettendo pi\u00f9 biossido di carbonio di Stati Uniti, India, Russia e Giappone \u2013 i quattro Paesi con i pi\u00f9 alti livelli d\u2019inquinamento \u2013 messi insieme.La Cina sta cercando di seguire le orme dei Paesi avanzati Attraverso la trasformazione della sua economia. Questo si realizzerebbe abbandonando l'offerta di manodopera a basso costo impiegata per la produzione di beni, anche questi a basso costo, per il resto del mondo, optando per industrie pi\u00f9 sofisticate e lucrative, come la tecnologia e i servizi, settori trainati di pi\u00f9 dalla crescita salariale e dal consumo della sua fiorente popolazione di 1.4 miliardi di persone. Il risultato vedr\u00e0 la Cina passare il testimone ad altri Paesi che possono offrire costi di lavoro pi\u00f9 bassi, come il Vietnam, per la produzione di beni a buon mercato.La Cina \u00e8 intenzionata a raggiungere questo obbiettivo in tempi brevi. Nel 2015 il governo ha rilasciato un piano decennale chiamato 'Made by China 2025', che dovrebbe riflettere un allontanamento dal modello 'Made in China' per cui \u00e8 attualmente noto. Questo piano dettagliato \u00e8 volto a rendere la Cina una potenza leader nella prossima generazione tecnologica che interesser\u00e0 settori come la robotica, l\u2019intelligenza artificiale (AI) e le telecomunicazioni 5G...\u2026 ma questo progetto ha le sue conseguenzeLa Cina \u00e8 solo a met\u00e0 di questo piano decennale, ma sta gi\u00e0 mostrando i sui frutti dato che il Paese \u00e8 sempre pi\u00f9 influente sulla scena mondiale. Prendiamo, ad esempio, Huawei e ZTE, due delle principali societ\u00e0 di telecomunicazioni del Paese. Entrambe sono considerate leader nella tecnologia 5G, che dovrebbe liberare il pieno potenziale per altre innovazioni, dai veicoli autonomi all'intelligenza artificiale. Si sostiene che gli Stati Uniti stiano cominciando a perdere terreno rispetto loro pi\u00f9 grande partner e rivale nella corsa tecnologica. Questa argomentazione \u00e8 stata incoraggiata dopo che il governo britannico ha sfidato i moniti di Washington, sostenendo che il coinvolgimento di Huawei nell\u2019implementazione della sua rete 5G potrebbe compromettere la sicurezza del Regno Unito, consentendo loro di svolgere un ruolo limitato nella sua rete.Oltre la minaccia che la Cina rappresenta per il dominio delle aziende tecnologiche americane, gli Stati Uniti e le altre economie occidentali sono scettici circa i progetti della Cina. Il Paese sta appoggiando la scalata delle sue aziende tramite sussidi statali e facendo leva sulle imprese statali, che gli Stati Uniti sostengono non essere in linea con gli standard commerciali mondiali. Gli Stati Uniti si lamentano da tempo dell\u2019uso da parte della Cina dei sussidi per sostenere le aziende cinesi, discriminando le aziende straniere che operano nel paese. Ad esempio, da tempo la Cina \u00e8 accusata di aver ingiustamente intaccato i progressi tecnologici e la propriet\u00e0 intellettuali di aziende straniere. Nella pratica, tutte le aziende straniere che vogliono fare affari in Cina devono formare una joint venture con una societ\u00e0 cinese e condividere la propriet\u00e0 intellettuale (IP) e la tecnologia - e gli Stati Uniti sostengono che questo ha dato al Paese l'opportunit\u00e0 di rubare segreti professionali a proprio vantaggio.Questa \u00e8 la ragione principale per cui il presidente degli Stati Uniti Donald Trump ha iniziato la sua prolungata guerra commerciale contro la Cina. Gli Stati Uniti sono pronti a mettere un freno all\u2019espansione internazionale della Cina, come nel 5G, e ad affrontare il deficit commerciale del Paese con la Cina.Quali sono i modi migliori per investire in Cina?Ci sono diversi modi tramite i quali gli investitori possono ottenere un\u2019esposizione su aziende e titoli cinesi. \u00c8 possibile scegliere tra una serie di titoli cinesi o, per coloro che desiderano un'esposizione pi\u00f9 ampia e che seguono una strategia a basso rischio, utilizzare gli Exchange Traded Fund (ETF).Una volta pronto, potrai iniziare a fare trading con IG. Puoi fare trading con strumenti derivati come i CFD per utilizzare la leva finanziaria.Apri un conto reale oppure fai pratica senza rischi con un conto demo .I migliori titoli cinesi da tenere d\u2019occhioDi seguito sono riportati i cinque titoli cinesi pi\u00f9 popolari tra i clienti di IG.Geely AutomobileLa Cina \u00e8 il pi\u00f9 grande mercato automobilistico del mondo e negli ultimi anni un'azienda \u00e8 diventata in uno dei pi\u00f9 grandi produttori del Paese: Geely. Nel 2019 ha venduto 1.36 milioni di veicoli e, sebbene offra 17 modelli diversi, vende principalmente berline e SUV. L\u2019azienda \u00e8 responsabile della vendita di praticamente tutte le auto in Cina, ma anche le esportazioni sono in forte espansione, soprattutto verso l'Europa orientale, il Medio Oriente e l'Africa. L\u2019anno scorso le esportazioni sono pi\u00f9 che raddoppiate, ma ci\u00f2 non \u00e8 stato sufficiente a compensare un calo del 12% in Cina, con un conseguente calo complessivo del 9%. Tuttavia, la compagnia punta all\u2019 aumentao della produzione nel 2020 di circa il 4%, portandolo a 1.41 milioni di unit\u00e0. L\u2019ambizione di lungo termine di Geely \u00e8 quella di essere leader in ci\u00f2 che definisce una \u2018nuova energia e veicoli elettrici\u2019, o \u2018NEEV\u2019. Il suo obiettivo \u00e8 quello di generare il 90% delle vendite dal NEEV. La strada da fare \u00e8 ancora lunga dato che ha venduto solo 113,000 di unit\u00e0 l'anno scorso, pari al solo l'8% delle vendite. Gli investitori possono anche aspettarsi che Geely diventi pi\u00f9 influente al di fuori della Cina nei prossimi anni. Ha acquistato marchi esteri, tra cui il britannico Lotus la casa di auto svedese Volvo. Di recente ha acquistato una quota pari al 10% del produttore tedesco Daimler. Recenti report suggeriscono anche che Geely sta considerando di acquistare somme significative dalla casa automobilistica di lusso britannica Aston Martin, al momento in difficolt\u00e0.Fai trading sui titoli GeelyTencentTencent gestisce una variet\u00e0 di servizi Internet in Cina, tra cui la pi\u00f9 grande piattaforma di social media del Paese, QQ, oltre ai servizi di messaggistica Weixin e WeChat.

Oltre 1 miliardo di persone utilizza ogni mese i servizi di messaggistica e oltre 500 milioni sono utenti dei social media. La diversit\u00e0 dell\u2019azienda e i suoi flussi di reddito la rendono una proposta unica per chiunque voglia acquisire esposizione sulla Cina.

Oltre il 90% dei suoi profitti operativi proviene da singoli clienti al dettaglio che utilizzano i suoi servizi. Questa situazione \u00e8 solo momentanea, in quanto la societ\u00e0 si sta espandendo in nuove aree e la sua capacit\u00e0 di raggiungere nuovi clienti di attuare il cross-selling , migliora di continuo. Oltre un terzo di tutti i suoi clienti utilizza pi\u00f9 di un servizio Ping An.Ping An, pur essendo operativamente confinata in Cina, \u00e8 gi\u00e0 il secondo principale assicuratore del mondo dopo Berkshire Hathaway Sta diventando un finanziatore chiave delle nuove tecnologie e ha interessi in tutti i settori, dall'aviazione alle farmacie, il che lo rende un ottimo modo per ottenere un'ampia esposizione.Fai trading sui titoli Ping AnMTR CorpMTR Corp, o Mass Transit Railway Corporation, \u00e8 di propriet\u00e0 del governo cinese ed \u00e8 responsabile della gestione della rete ferroviaria di Hong Kong, comprese le principali linee ad alta velocit\u00e0 come la Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong.

            "description": "Electric vehicle (EV) major Tesla will not want to miss out on the \"action\" in India, according to Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal. Speaking at the 'India Business Leader Awards' on December 2, Goyal also said that a real growth rate of 7 percent on average could result in India becoming a $35 trillion economy in another 25-27 years. \"Mr Musk is so active on X that he will be the person who'll let us know when Tesla is setting up in India,\" Goyal said in response to a question on when the US-based EV heavyweight will set up shop in India, with speculation rife on the same. Also Read: Model Y could be the first model Tesla rolls out in India \"The age of electric vehicles has arrived. In another two to three years, I see all new two-wheeler sales being electric. In three-wheeler sales, we are close to 100 percent electric or CNG-driven,\" Goyal said, adding that while the figure for four-wheelers was only around 2 percent, the future was bright as local manufacturers - Maruti, Tata, and Mahindra, among others - were coming out with \"some fantastic offerings.\" \"We will see a lot of action in the four-wheeler space. Therefore, Tesla will not like to miss out on the action,\" the commerce minister said. Speaking more broadly on the Indian economy, Goyal said India's per capita income will be close to $20,000 by 2047, with a GDP of around $35 trillion in another 27 years time even if the real growth rate averaged a conservative 7 percent. \"Even if we were to grow at 7 percent per year on average \u2013 although I sense that our growth will accelerate going forward and inch toward a double-digit number \u2013 and 4-4.5 percent inflation, this gives us nominal growth of 11-11.5 percent. Assuming rupee depreciation of 1-1.5 percent per year, that gives us nominal growth of 10 percent in US dollar terms. So that means it will take 7 years to double our economy in US dollar terms. It should not take more than 25-27 years to be a $35 trillion economy,\" Goyal said. Also Read: India's July-September GDP growth at 7.6%, sharply above forecasts On inflation, Goyal commented that it has been largely under control, except for the issues caused by global developments, and that the government was constantly taking steps to keep prices stable. \"We remain a step ahead of the curve, and I can assure the people of India that we will make sure that you will continue to get your high-quality foodstuff at an affordable price,\" he said.",

Selon son bilan financier du second trimestre 2020, le g\u00e9ant de l'e-commerce a ainsi doubl\u00e9 ses profits par rapport \u00e0 la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode en 2019 en atteignant plus de 5,2 milliards de b\u00e9n\u00e9fices alors m\u00eame que la firme a \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019ordre par la justice fran\u00e7aise.

On the basis of airport type, the market is divided into commercial airport, cargo service airport, reliever airport, and general aviation airport. By technology, the market is bifurcated into Millimeter Radio Wave (MMW) Scanner and Backscatter X-RAY Scanner. By region, the market analyzed across North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and LAMEA.Full body scanners are devices used as an effective solution for the detection of contraband, hidden weapons, explosives, and other substances, carried inside or outside the body. Modern full body scanners are image-free people security scanners that detect both metallic and non-metallic items, which cannot be done by a walk-through or hand-held metal detectors.Download Report Sample (278 Pages PDF with Insights, Charts, Tables, Figures) @The global airport full body scanner market is driven by the increase in need for security and surveillance in national and international airports owing to rise in smuggling and terrorism activities. Further, full body scanners require less check time and hence they help reduce the waiting time of the passengers. On the contrary, concerns relating to health and privacy over the use of full body scanners for contraband detection is expected to restraint the growth of the global full body scanners market.However, the FAA modernization and Reform Act, 2012 mandates the use of \u201cautomated target recognition\u201d software, which replaces the naked body image by a mannequin of both genders. This removes the fear of privacy violation. Moreover, the scanners are based on Millimeter Wave Technology (MMW) comprising non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation, which means it is safe for all the passengers, including pregnant women. Recently, the Indian Govt. has made it mandatory to have full body scanners in all airports; this decision may be followed by others. This is expected to offer new opportunities for market growth. Moreover, companies are investing highly on improving the robustness, size, and reliability of the full body scanners. Furthermore, the integration of artificial intelligence in detection is expected to minimize false alarms.Interested to Procure The Data?

But the conclusion of that sea trip was not the end of the story; in fact it marked the beginning of another journey.After a year and a half of further tropical-climate maturation \u2014 under the care of Foursquare Owner and Master Distiller Richard Seale \u2014 the one-of-a-kind Camus Caribbean Expedition Cognac has now concluded its double maturation process.The one-off experimental series will be limited to 4,500 bottles and released through key selected retailers. 1,000 bottles will be available for sale en primeur from 1 September to 27 September.As reported, the expedition was launched to explore the possibilities of maturing Cognac in oceanic conditions. The aim was to create an \u201cunprecedented taste profile\u201d by allowing the Cognac to undergo the process of \u2018sea maturation\u2019; an 18th century and early 19th-century practice of exporting Cognac around the world by sea.The De Gallant sailed from the port of La Rochelle, France on 23 November 2018 and reached Bridgetown port on 10 January 2019, making stops in Gijon and Tenerife.The expedition was launched in partnership with TOWT, an eco-conscious transportation company that specialises in the transport of goods by sailboat. Since its launch, TOWT has saved a total of 185 tonnes of CO2 by travelling 48,000 miles and delivering 400 tonnes of products using wind energy.When the ship set sail, the barrels contained liquids with a 48% ABV. already in their fourth year of ageing. The casks were exposed to multiple environmental factors during the voyage, including the ship\u2019s constant motion, the oceanic climate influence, and atmospheric pressure within the oak barrels.The Camus Caribbean Expedition Cognac was kept in traditional Bajan cellars, with the casks stacked on top of each other during the tropical maturation period. After analysing the finished product, Camus discovered that the wood tannins gave greater structure and complexity in tropical climates. This showed a significant aromatic evolution in the liquid due to the higher temperature and humidity in Barbados.The Camus Caribbean Expedition Cognac offers intense fruity aromas of banana and pear, complemented by spicy accents of cocoa bean and nutmeg.

The global food flavor and enhancer market is segmented based on type and application. Based on the type, the market is segmented into flavor and enhancer. The flavor is further sub-segmented into the natural flavor, synthetic flavor, and nature-identical flavoring substances.Natural flavoring substances are those flavoring substances which are obtained by enzymatic processes, physical extraction from natural sources and microbiological techniques, from plants and animal primary materials, are called natural flavors. Natural flavor is also described as the essential oil, essence, or extractive. Examples of the natural flavor enhancers include natural citral, almond benzaldehyde, lemongrass, and butter. The flavor enhancers obtained from natural sources are preferred by consumers over the synthetic flavor enhancers.A full report of Global Food Flavor and Enhancer Market is available at:Citral present in large amounts in lemon peel and lemongrass oil is used in Asian cuisine as a flavor enhancer. The combination of citral and capsaicin, the secondary metabolite present in chili is used in Thai cuisine. Benzaldehyde, which is present in high amounts in almond oil, is the second most widely used flavor enhancer in the world. Thus, possessing such benefits over other types of flavor it is projected to hold a considerable share in the global food flavor and enhancer market.To learn more about this report request a free sample copy @Nature? Identical flavoring substances are flavoring agents which contain chemically synthesized products, and are identical to the natural compounds in their chemical aspects. Owing to the unavailability and expensive natural flavors, these natural flavors are chemically synthesized called nature-identical flavoring agents. Since they are similar to natural flavors, they are better accepted by consumers and not associated with adverse health effects. These flavors also have properties, such as natural flavors that each person experiences through the senses, including taste, sight, smell, and touch. For instance, vanillin, which is identical to vanilla obtained mainly from the pods of the Mexican species Vanilla Since they are chemically synthesized, they are less expensive than the natural flavors and they are also stable.Artificial flavoring substances are not identical to natural flavors since they are made by chemicals such as ethyl nitrite, ethyl benzyl acetate, diphenyl disulfide among others. These flavoring agents are produced with varying molecular structures, however, the similarity of these molecules with the natural flavors on structure, flavor, or the sensory properties differs among the different flavoring agents and they are not structure-dependent. Additionally, owing to the presence of several chemicals, these flavors might cause some side effects and thus, it holds a modest share in the global food flavor and enhancer market.Global Food Flavor and Enhancer Market\u2013 SegmentationBy Type\u2022 Flavoro Natural Flavoro Synthetic Flavor\u2022 Flavor Enhancero Acidulantso Glutamateso Hydrolyzed Vegetable Proteinso Yeast Extractso OthersBy Application\u2022 Bakery & Confectionery\u2022 Processed & Convenience Food\u2022 Dairy Products\u2022 Beverages\u2022 OthersFor more customized data, request for report customization @Global Food Flavor and Enhancer Market\u2013 Segment by RegionNorth America\u2022 United States\u2022 CanadaEurope\u2022 Germany\u2022 United Kingdom\u2022 France\u2022 Spain\u2022 Italy\u2022 Rest of EuropeAsia-Pacific\u2022 China\u2022 Japan\u2022 India\u2022 Rest of Asia-PacificRest of the World\u2022 Middle East & Africa\u2022 Latin AmericaCompany Profiles\u2022 Archer Daniels Midland Co.\u2022 Associated British Foods Plc\u2022 BASF Nutrition (BASF SE)\u2022 Cargill Inc.\u2022 Corbion N.V.\u2022 DSM Koninklijke N.V.\u2022 European Flavours & Fragrances PLC\u2022 Firmenich SA\u2022 Givaudan\u2022 Huabao International Holdings Ltd.\u2022 International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.\u2022 Kerry Group Plc\u2022 Robertet Group\u2022 Symrise AG\u2022 Synergy Flavors\u2022 Takasago International Corp.\u2022 Tate & Lyle Plc\u2022 T.

Speaking at the 'India Business Leader Awards' on December 2, Goyal also said that a real growth rate of 7 percent on average could result in India becoming a $35 trillion economy in another 25-27 years. \"Mr Musk is so active on X that he will be the person who'll let us know when Tesla is setting up in India,\" Goyal said in response to a question on when the US-based EV heavyweight will set up shop in India, with speculation rife on the same. Also Read: Model Y could be the first model Tesla rolls out in India \"The age of electric vehicles has arrived. In another two to three years, I see all new two-wheeler sales being electric. In three-wheeler sales, we are close to 100 percent electric or CNG-driven,\" Goyal said, adding that while the figure for four-wheelers was only around 2 percent, the future was bright as local manufacturers - Maruti, Tata, and Mahindra, among others - were coming out with \"some fantastic offerings.\" \"We will see a lot of action in the four-wheeler space. Therefore, Tesla will not like to miss out on the action,\" the commerce minister said. Speaking more broadly on the Indian economy, Goyal said India's per capita income will be close to $20,000 by 2047, with a GDP of around $35 trillion in another 27 years time even if the real growth rate averaged a conservative 7 percent. \"Even if we were to grow at 7 percent per year on average \u2013 although I sense that our growth will accelerate going forward and inch toward a double-digit number \u2013 and 4-4.5 percent inflation, this gives us nominal growth of 11-11.5 percent. Assuming rupee depreciation of 1-1.5 percent per year, that gives us nominal growth of 10 percent in US dollar terms. So that means it will take 7 years to double our economy in US dollar terms. It should not take more than 25-27 years to be a $35 trillion economy,\" Goyal said. Also Read: India's July-September GDP growth at 7.6%, sharply above forecasts On inflation, Goyal commented that it has been largely under control, except for the issues caused by global developments, and that the government was constantly taking steps to keep prices stable. \"We remain a step ahead of the curve, and I can assure the people of India that we will make sure that you will continue to get your high-quality foodstuff at an affordable price,\" he said.",

Maison No. 9 goes down smooth, you\u2019re all going to love it,\u201d Malone said when news of the wine was announced.According to Forbes, Malone developed an interest in wine after enjoying some knockout bottles from actor Mark Wahlberg\u2019s impressive fine wine collection.\u201cWe started going to Mark\u2019s house, and he has this crazy wine collection. Post acquired this expensive wine taste. All of a sudden, he\u2019s this expert wine guy.

            "description": "Simply sign up to the Coronavirus economic impact myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.In a dismal year for most companies, a minority have shone: pharmaceutical groups boosted by their hunt for a Covid-19 vaccine; technology giants buoyed by the trend for working from home; and retailers offering lockdown necessities online.Public companies had the tailwind of a surprisingly robust stock market \u2014 which many believe is a bubble. To rank companies that prospered in the pandemic, we have chosen to look at equity value added. Later in the series, we will look at an alternative gauge of success, as well as the big corporate losers and four thematic winners: pharma, cloud computing, ecommerce and gaming. Tom Braithwaite1. AmazonSECTOR: ecommerce / hq: seattle, us$401.1bn Market cap addedKey stat: Amazon anticipates it could spend $4bn to keep its logistics running during the coronavirus crisis.As world leaders ordered their citizens indoors, Amazon became the emergency port of call for those desperate to stock up on vital household goods \u2014 a rush that led the company to temporarily shut its warehouses to \u201cnon-essential\u201d products. Record revenues followed, but also soaring costs. Chief executive Jeff Bezos warned as much as $4bn could be spent on virus mitigation, such as testing labs and thermal cameras \u2014 potentially pushing Amazon into its first quarterly loss since 2015. Still, the accelerated shift to online shopping and the increased importance of its cloud computing business in the remote work era drove Amazon\u2019s stock to all-time highs. Dave Lee in San Francisco2. MicrosoftSector: TECHnology / HQ: Redmond, us$269.9bn Market cap addedKey stat: 75m people used the Teams communication app in a single day in April, up from 20m in late 2019.Microsoft\u2019s shift to the cloud under Satya Nadella has left it well-placed for a world where large numbers of people are working remotely. The Teams communication app has become a way for workers to stay in touch. The Azure cloud computing platform has become a more critical part of the digital backbone for many companies. Microsoft even has a way to satisfy the personal: a record 90m players turned to the Xbox Live gaming service in April. Richard Waters in San Francisco3. AppleSector: Technology / HQ: Cupertino, US$219.1bn Market cap addedKey stat: The iPhone maker managed to rake in $58.3bn in revenue in the March quarter, despite closing all of its retail stores.While all of Apple\u2019s 500 stores around the world were forced to close, revenues in the opening quarter were resilient thanks to robust online sales. Apple managed to release a new iPhone, iMac and MacBook Air, drawing more users into an ever-expanding ecosystem of wearables and services. Apple executives predicted sales of some items would even accelerate, as millions of consumers working from home would opt to upgrade their electronics. Investors crowned Apple the first $1.5tn company. Patrick McGee in San Francisco4. TeslaSector: AUTOs / HQ: PALo alto, us$108.4bn Market cap addedKey stat: 402 miles: the range of Tesla\u2019s latest Model S, underscoring its technological lead.The clear technology leader for battery-powered cars, Tesla is outpacing legacy competitors as they struggle to retool factories and perfect software. Meanwhile, chief executive Elon Musk is promising to upend the entire model of car ownership with fleets of self-driving robotaxis that would charge by the mile. Still, even Mr Musk said on Twitter, on May 1, that the \u201cTesla stock price is too high\u201d. Since then it has climbed even higher. Patrick McGee5. TencentSector: technology / HQ: shenzhen, china$93bn Market cap addedKey stat: Online gaming revenues rose 31 per cent in the first quarter.Chinese people isolated at home turned to Tencent\u2019s virtual worlds. In its hit games such as Honor of Kings, users shelled out for new weapons and outfits. Tencent\u2019s video subscriber numbers swelled to 112m, its music streamers jumped to 43m and monthly users of its social media app WeChat \u2014 indispensable for buying noodles and verifying users\u2019 health during the coronavirus period \u2014 hit 1.2bn. In a global spending spree, Tencent has exploited falling valuations: it recently acquired Norwegian game developer Funcom, took a stake in German developer Yager, and poured capital into an array of fintech start-ups. Ryan McMorrow in Beijing6. FacebookSector: technology / HQ: MENLO PARK, US$85.7bn Market cap addedKey stat: 39 per cent \u2014 the rise in advertising impressions at Facebook in the first quarter of the year.Knocks to Facebook\u2019s advertising business during the pandemic have been offset by its 2.6bn entertainment-starved users spending more time on the platform. Small business advertisers slashed their marketing budgets. But Facebook\u2019s engagement levels exploded, increasing its advertising impressions. The company has launched new video chat and livestream features, as well as an ecommerce play to rival Amazon, known as Facebook Shops. However, its content moderation capabilities have been stretched by coronavirus-related misinformation and conspiracy theories. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has come under fire from employees for failing to flag incendiary or misleading statements from US President Donald Trump. Hannah Murphy in San Francisco7. NvidiaSector: technology / HQ: santa clara, us$83.3bn Market cap addedKey stat: Hours spent playing games on Nvidia\u2019s platforms jumped 50 per cent during lockdowns.Nvidia\u2019s graphics chips have become a mainstay of gaming machines and machine learning systems, insulating the company from the worst of the downturn. Sales of gaming chips were dented by the closure of internet caf\u00e9s in China, while the automotive industry, a big customer, has experienced a collapse in sales. But Nvidia\u2019s business has been helped by the growing importance of ecommerce in selling new graphics cards, along with a shift towards online gaming. It has also been riding a boom in demand for data centre chips from big internet companies, as AI becomes a more important component of their services and overall digital activity jumps. Richard Waters8. AlphabetSector: technology / HQ: mountain view, us$68.1bn Market cap addedKey stat: Even as advertising collapsed at the end of March, YouTube\u2019s revenue was still growing nearly 10 per cent.Given that online advertising went into sharp decline as the crisis unfolded, early signs suggest Alphabet has shown surprising resilience. Sectors such as travel and local services may have dried up, but in other areas Google \u2014 which supplies virtually all Alphabet\u2019s revenue \u2014 has reported that demand is holding up better than expected. Search advertising appeared to stabilise early in the crisis, after touching bottom in late March. The Google cloud computing platform, Meet video app and Play app store have benefited from the shift of work and entertainment online. Richard Waters9. PayPalSector: payments / HQ: San jose, US$65.4bn Market cap addedKey stat: 7.4m \u2014 net new users in April.The pioneer of online payments has found increased relevance in the real-world pandemic, rolling out new capabilities for merchants to handle contactless payments in physical stores. PayPal facilitated the transfer of more than $1bn in federal loans as part of the US Small Business Administration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program. Its money transfer app Venmo was popular, pre-coronavirus, for friends settling dinner bills. Now, the company says, it is witnessing larger, cross-generational transfers \u2014 such as socially-distanced withdrawals from the Bank of Mum and Dad \u2014 and increased usage for paying for goods and services that might otherwise have been paid for with cash. Dave Lee10. T-MobileSector: telecommunications / HQ: Bellevue, us$59.7bn Market cap addedKey stat: T-Mobile added 452,000 postpaid phone subscribers in the first quarter.The US wireless company benefited from the twin forces of lockdowns, which made people more dependent on their phones for connection, and the closing of its long-awaited merger with rival Sprint. The deal made T-Mobile the third-largest player in the US telecoms market, trailing AT&T and Verizon, and is expected to give the big phone companies more pricing power. Anna Nicolaou in New York11. PinduoduoSector: ecommerce / HQ: shanghai, china$55.2bn Market cap addedKey stat: Shoppers on its platform increased to 628m.The ecommerce group benefited as hundreds of millions of Chinese turned to shopping from their smartphones rather than going to malls. As demand rose for its ultra-cheap goods, the total value of transactions over its platform soared and revenues were up 44 per cent in the first quarter. Its annual shopper count is fast approaching the 726m who shop with its chief rival Alibaba. Ryan McMorrowThe \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019 series aired originally on AMC, with seasons subsequently made available for streaming on Netflix12. NetflixSector: media / HQ: LOS GATOS, us$55.1bn Market cap addedKey stat: 183m global subscribers by the end of Q1, a 23 per cent jump from a year earlier.Netflix added twice as many subscribers as it had forecast in the first three months of the year, as the largest paid streaming service entertained global lockdown audiences with shows such as Tiger King, La Casa de Papel and Love is Blind. The biggest boost came from Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where it signed up nearly 7m subscribers in the first quarter. The company is enjoying a \u201cperfect storm\u201d, said Michael Nathanson, analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cThe longer the current situation lasts, the bigger the benefit to Netflix.\u201d Anna Nicolaou13. Meituan DianpingSector: Ecommerce / HQ: Beijing, china$53.6bn Market cap addedKey stat: Food delivery orders had bounced back to 90 per cent of their pre-pandemic level by mid-May.China\u2019s \u201ceverything app\u201d was hit hard by the country\u2019s lockdown, which closed many of the restaurants it partnered with to deliver meals \u2014 its largest chunk of business \u2014 as it swung to a loss in the first quarter. But by May, executives were upbeat as food delivery and travel booking recovered. Analysts said that high-end restaurants, which were afraid of \u201ccannibalisation\u201d and \u201cbad user experience\u201d, had no choice but to turn to the platform for deliveries. Its average ticket price climbed 14 per cent in the first quarter and many riders began delivering to set spots in apartment buildings, saving them time and improving their efficiency. Ryan McMorrow14. ShopifySector: Ecommerce / HQ: Ottawa, canada$51.4bn Market cap addedKey stat: 62 per cent more new Shopify stores were created from March 13 to April 24 than the previous six weeks as locked-down retailers rushed online.Shopify overtook eBay to become the second-biggest ecommerce group after Amazon by US market share last year, processing $61bn worth of merchandise globally. The pandemic accelerated shopping\u2019s shift online, with Shopify among the prime beneficiaries \u2014 doubling its valuation since the start of 2020. Start-ups such as Allbirds shoes and global groups including Heinz are among hundreds of thousands of brands using its software and services to sell directly to customers \u2014 cutting out middlemen such as Amazon. Tim Bradshaw in LondonEric Yuan, chief executive of Zoom Video15. Zoom VideoSector: technology / HQ: SAN jOSE, us$47.9bn Market cap addedKey stat: Zoom video calls reached 300m participants a day* in April.The video conferencing company has come to symbolise the work-from-home boom of 2020, making its fake digital backdrops a cultural touchstone of the coronavirus crisis. Opening its business-focused app to a wide group of non-paying consumers and educational institutions brought challenges, but also helped turn Zoom into a household name. Wider usage brought attention to its security lapses and while some prominent companies warned their staff not to use it, the controversy did little to hurt business. By the end of April, the number of medium and larger companies using Zoom was up more than three-fold from a year before, while revenue soared 169 per cent. Richard Waters16. JD.comSector: ecommerce / HQ: beijing, china$44.3bn Market cap addedKey stat: Revenues jumped 21 per cent in the first quarter.When China\u2019s lockdown hit in late January, JD.com was the only ecommerce player reliably delivering packages. Its red, three-wheeled delivery carts remained on city streets as those ferrying goods on behalf of its rivals Alibaba and Pinduoduo struggled to find couriers. Its shares jumped almost 6 per cent on its trading debut in Hong Kong on June 18, the same day as its annual shopping bonanza, as it raised nearly $4bn in the second-largest share sale globally this year. Ryan McMorrow17. AdobeSector: software / HQ: SAN JOSE, US$40.1bn Market cap addedKey stat: The number of PDF documents shared using Adobe\u2019s software rose 50 per cent compared with same quarter a year ago.After becoming the first big software company to shift its business to the cloud, switching one-off product sales for more reliable subscription income, Adobe has experienced barely any interruption from the pandemic. It has also been well-positioned for the world of remote work. By the end of April it had reported an across-the-board jump in activity on its cloud services for content creation \u2014 which have grown out of products such as Photoshop \u2014 as well as workflow tools based around digital documents. Richard Waters18. AudiSector: AUTOs / HQ: Ingolstadt, Germany$37.8bn Market cap addedKey stat: \u20ac4.6bn \u2014 Audi\u2019s operating profit in 2019, the largest of VW\u2019s 12 marques.Covid-19 hit the so-called Four Rings hard, bringing its usually healthy profit margins down to almost zero in the first three months of 2020. But for investors with their hands on the 0.36 per cent of publicly-traded Audi stock, the past few months have been something of a bonanza. Trading at \u20ac800 at the start of the year, the shares have been on a meteoric rise since February, when parent company VW announced it would buy out remaining stakeholders. In mid-June, VW confirmed it would pay \u20ac1,551.53 per outstanding share, subject to approval at the company\u2019s next AGM. Joe Miller in Frankfurt19. AbbVieSector: pharmaceuticals / HQ: Chicago, US$37.7bn Market cap addedKey stat: Received regulatory clearance for its $63bn deal for Allergan in May.Botox was one of the key reasons for AbbVie wanting to buy Allergan \u2014 securing solid cash flow from the cosmetic treatment. There were concerns that in a world of social distancing, sales would suffer. But as plastic surgeons reopen, analysts believe Botox sales will almost be back to normal by the middle of the third quarter. Despite losing patent protection on its anti-inflammatory Humira \u2014 the bestselling drug in the world \u2014 in the US by 2023, the prospects for four other drugs, including in oncology and for psoriasis, have enticed investors to a stock with \u201cstable growth\u201d and a good dividend yield. Hannah Kuchler in New York20. Kweichow MoutaiSector: beverages / HQ: Zunyi, China$35.5bn Market cap addedKey stat: Consistently maintains a profit margin above 90 per cent.Kweichow Moutai, maker of China\u2019s best-known distilled spirit, seems well positioned to benefit from the reopening of the Chinese economy. While the spirit serves as a lubricant for business deals, a shortage of supply is giving an extra boost. The distiller increased annual output by a mere 30 per cent from 2014 to 2019 even though China\u2019s high-net-worth population, Moutai\u2019s main consumer, more than doubled over the same period. Sun Yu in Beijing21. Chugai PharmaceuticalSeCTOR: Pharmaceuticals / HQ: Tokyo, Japan$33.9bn Market cap addedKey stat: Global Hemlibra sales surged 146 per cent during the first quarter.The Japanese unit of Switzerland-based Roche is the producer of rheumatoid arthritis drug actemra, which is being trialled in the US and Japan as a potential treatment for critically ill coronavirus patients. However, the pandemic is not the only catalyst for the sharp rally in its shares. Chugai\u2019s profits rose 57 per cent in the first quarter on expanding sales of its haemophilia blockbuster Hemlibra, which has catapulted the company into becoming Japan\u2019s most valuable drugmaker. Kana Inagaki in Tokyo22. Alibaba GroupSector: ECOMMERCE / HQ: HANGZHOU, CHINA$32.8bn Market cap addedKey stat: Alibaba\u2019s cloud unit grew 57 per cent in the first quarter.China\u2019s ecommerce giant experienced stagnating sales at its core Tmall and Taobao online marketplaces in the first quarter under the strain of undermanned courier partners. However, other business units such as cloud computing and bricks and mortar grocery helped it achieve 22 per cent year-on-year sales growth. Now, with couriers back at their posts and its millions of merchants back at their keyboards, the Hangzhou-based company is expected to fully reap the rewards of coronavirus-induced caution. Ryan McMorrow23. Sea GroupSector: technology / HQ: singapore$31.8bn Market cap addedKey stat: Sea\u2019s self-developed global game Free Fire hit a record of more than 80m daily active users in the first quarter of 2020.South-east Asia\u2019s biggest listed technology company benefited from drawing the bulk of its revenue from two coronavirus-proof sectors: gaming and ecommerce. Demand for its hit game Free Fire surged in the March quarter while a consumer shift to digital channels boosted sales for its loss-making ecommerce business in south-east Asia and Taiwan. Mercedes Ruehl in Singapore24. The Home DepotSector: retail / HQ: Atlanta, US$31.5bn Market cap addedKey stat: Like-for-like sales rose in 11 of The Home Depot\u2019s 14 departments in the first quarter.While much of the retail sector has struggled with forced store closures and a drop in consumer spending, The Home Depot is among a select group whose sales have jumped in the crisis. US authorities allowed the company\u2019s megastores to remain open throughout the pandemic because much of the equipment they stock, such as water heaters, refrigerators and electrical and plumbing gear, make them lifelines in home emergencies. Americans have also been upgrading their living space, buying more furniture, decor and lighting, while undertaking more DIY projects, boosting demand for tools and materials. Alistair Gray25. ASMLSector: technology / HQ: Veldhoven, Netherlands$27.3bn Market cap addedKey stat: ASML\u2019s R&D expenses for the first quarter of 2020 were \u20ac544m, a year-on-year increase of 15 per centThe Dutch giant\u2019s dominance in photolithography for chipmaking has helped it weather Covid-19 disruptions. Its advances in the use of extreme ultraviolet light means ASML\u2019s machines can etch a greater number of circuits per chip \u2014 key for advances in the \u201cinternet of things\u201d, AI and 5G communications. Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan in London26. RocheSector: Pharmaceuticals / HQ: Basel, Switzerland$27.1bn Market cap addedKey stat: 100 per cent sensitivity \u2014 or the real number of positives Roche claims its own antibody test can detect 14 days after a positive PCR test.Roche, which is one of the diagnostics \u201cBig Four\u201d, has also benefited from the rollout of its tests for coronavirus, which check for current and recent signs of infection through a process known as PCR and by checking for antibodies. Its high-throughput machines are used to quickly process hundreds of tests. The Swiss drugmaker is also testing actemra, an arthritis drug, against Covid-19, both on its own and in combination with Gilead\u2019s remdesivir. Donato Paolo Mancini in London27. ProsusSector: internet / HQ: amsterdam, netherlands$24.6bn Market cap addedKey stat: $8bn \u2014 the cash and debt available for Naspers\u2019 international investment vehicle to make deals.While it has long been the good fortune of the South African internet group Naspers to own 31 per cent of China\u2019s Tencent, exposure to the Fortnite-to-WeChat giant paid off again this year. It has led to a surge of one-third in the share price of Prosus, the company\u2019s European investment vehicle that is waving the cheque book for deals in the post-coronavirus world. Prosus, which houses the Tencent stake and other assets to make up Europe\u2019s biggest consumer internet group, already has globe-spanning businesses in sectors that could benefit if the pandemic does inspire a greater digital shift, such as food delivery and online education. Joseph Cotterill in Johannesburg28. ServiceNowSector: cloud software / HQ: Santa Clara, US$23.1bn Market cap addedKey stat: 80 per cent of revenue comes from repeat subscriptions paid by large companies.As a platform for automating back-room processes, ServiceNow stands to benefit from the greater pressure many companies feel to boost worker productivity and improve the overall efficiency of their operations. It also has a stable revenue base and guaranteed pipeline of new business in the years ahead, thanks to its use by big companies that pay regular subscriptions, and which are mostly at an early stage in applying the technology across their organisations. Richard Waters29. Regeneron PharmaceuticalsSector: Pharmaceuticals / HQ: NEW YoRK, US$20.1bn Market cap addedKey stat: Shares have risen more than one-third since February.Regeneron is working on repurposing an existing drug and developing a new antibody cocktail for Covid-19. Studies using Kevzara, an anti-inflammatory, to target the overactive immune response of some patients produced disappointing early results but the trial is being changed to focus only on patients with the most severe disease. Hannah Kuchler30. Alibaba Health InformationSector: healthcare / HQ: hong kong, china$20.1bn Market cap addedKey stat: Shares are up 129 per cent so far in 2020.A Hong Kong-listed company controlled by Jack Ma, it focuses on pharmaceutical ecommerce and operates China\u2019s drug product identification, authentication and tracking system. The company benefited from providing internet medical services during the Covid-19 emergency. Thomas Hale in Shanghai31. Samsung BiologicsSector: healthcare / HQ: Incheon, South Korea$20bn Market cap addedKey stat: 150 per cent increase in the share price in 12 months.A subsidiary of Samsung that focuses on manufacturing biopharmaceuticals on a contract basis, the company gained from striking deals this year with Vir Biotechnology \u2014 to produce Covid-19-neutralising antibody products \u2014 and GSK, to expand its manufacturing capacity. Donato Paolo Mancini32. Novo NordiskSector: Pharmaceuticals / HQ: Bagsvaerd, Denmark$19.8bn Market cap addedKey stat: Net profit in the first quarter was $1.74bn.One of the world\u2019s largest insulin producers, Novo Nordisk benefited from a recent surge in demand across the pharmaceuticals sector, as patients and healthcare providers stockpiled drugs. Donato Paolo Mancini33. SalesforceSector: cloud software / HQ: San Francisco, US$19.1bn Market cap addedKey stat: Sliced $1bn off its annual revenue guidance due to the difficulty of closing sales in the pandemic.As the pioneer of cloud-based software applications for businesses, Salesforce could be lifted by the greater urgency for companies to digitise their operations. The crisis has dented its growth in the short term, but investors are betting that \u201cdigital transformation\u201d will become an even bigger imperative for companies across the economy, with Salesforce among the winners. Richard Waters34. AdyenSector: payments / HQ: amsterdam, netherlands$19bn Market cap addedKey stat: Volume of payments processed increased 38 per cent year on year in the first quarter.A surge in online shopping helped prop up volumes at Adyen, which processes payments for companies such as Microsoft and eBay. Growth was dented by weakness in the travel sector and falling in-store sales, but Adyen expects to benefit in the long term as the crisis accelerates a shift from cash in favour of contactless payments. Nicholas Megaw in London35. Eli LillySector: pharmaceuticals / HQ: Indianapolis, US$18.8bn Market cap addedKey stat: $250m extra sales in the first quarter, attributed to Covid-19 stockpiling.Eli Lilly started the first study of an antibody treatment for Covid-19 this month. The medicine is derived from the antibody response from one of the first US patients to contract the disease. Working with the Canadian company AbCellera, it found the most effective antibodies and reproduced them. Hannah Kuchler36. ModernaSector: pharmaceuticals / HQ: cambridge, Us$18bn Market cap addedKey stat: 30,000 participants are expected to enrol in the phase-three trial of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate.Moderna was the first US company to get a potential coronavirus vaccine to human trial. Just 42 days after it received the genetic sequence of the virus, Moderna had a vaccine in vials ready to test. Its messenger RNA technology allows it to be super speedy \u2014 but no vaccine using it has ever been approved by a regulator. Hannah Kuchler37. Mercado LibreSector: ECOMMERCE / HQ: Buenos Aires, Argentina$18bn Market cap addedKey stat: The number of items sold on Mercado Libre\u2019s ecommerce platform surged 76 per cent in April.For Mercado Libre, being in the right place at the right time has proved critical. Its ecommerce platform has ballooned in popularity over the past five years, and by facilitating electronic payments during the pandemic lockdown, its sales have surged further. Latin America has relatively low ecommerce penetration \u2014 but Mercado Libre is already the clear leader in this sector. Benedict Mander in Buenos Aires38. DexcomSector: HEALTHCARE / HQ: San Diego, us$17.2bn Market cap addedKey stat: 44 per cent revenue growth in the first quarter of 2020.Dexcom makes a type of blood sugar monitor that continuously checks patients\u2019 glucose levels \u2014 a product that may have pushed the stock higher as the coronavirus crisis has increased demand for healthcare solutions for diabetics, who are an at-risk category for Covid-19. Donato Paolo Mancini39. NetEaseSector: technology / hQ: HANGZHOU, CHINA$17bn Market cap addedKey stat: Demand for its online games during coronavirus-led lockdown boosted first-quarter revenue by 18 per cent year on year.The Chinese gaming group, known for its mobile title Fantasy Westward Journey, benefited from millions of its users being stuck at home seeking entertainment due to the outbreak of coronavirus in China. The company, which receives four-fifths of its revenue from video games, used the momentum to pursue a $2.7bn secondary listing on the Hong Kong Exchange in June. Mercedes Ruehl in Singapore40.

Vertex PharmaceuticalsSector: Pharmaceuticals / HQ: boston, Us$16.3bn Market cap addedKey stat: The biotech reported 35.5 per cent sales growth in 2019.Vertex is not making a Covid-19 treatment. But the Boston-based biotech was able to beat expectations and raise its forecasts in the first quarter, as sales of its treatments for cystic fibrosis, a market where it is dominant, were unaffected by the pandemic.

            "description": "SlideshowBy Lauren EadsIn the next of our top London wine merchants series, we take a look at five modern classics, those founded within the past 50 years, and who have established a niche for themselves for the long term.These merchants have secured a position in our line-up not only by building a firm-footed business, but by continuously working to predict consumer trends and adapting their services to ensure they align with the demands of the market.This ability has never been more crucial, with those merchants with a strong presence online and grasp of social media more capable of remaining buoyant throughout tough trading conditions, not least the Covid-19 pandemic.For the most part we have focused exclusively on retailers that have a bricks and mortar element to their business, with two exceptions. We felt there were two merchants that despite not having a fixed retail unit had established themselves as modern classics in their own right, and deserved to be included in this round up.As before, here we have taken a look at the turnover of each merchant, their range and approach to selection, as well as how they are working to meet the challenges of the future.Click through to see our pick of London\u2019s top \u2018modern classic\u2019 merchants\u2026Click here for our top five classic London wine merchants.= 5. Goedhuis & Co Fine Wine MerchantsFounded: 1981Turnover: 2019 \u00a323.1m, vs \u00a320.6m in 2018, up 12%Goedhuis & Co was founded by chairman Johnny Goedhuis in 1981. Before that, Goedhuis had been employed by Corney & Barrow, and later set up Harrison, Cliff and Goedhuis in the mid 1970s, \u201cselling screw top bottles of Cavitello from my light-blue Vauxhall Viva\u201d. He later went into business with restaurateur and entrepreneur Mark Birley, of Mark\u2019s Club and Annabel\u2019s, prior to setting up Goedhuis.Nearly 40 years later, Goedhuis & Co operates from its head office in London, offering private and commercial clients wines from producers from all around the world as well as working with the most famous established estates\u2019 First Growth Clarets and Grand Cru Burgundies.\u201cWe seek quality and individuality,\u201d explains David Roberts MW, buying director, on its selection process. \u201cWe look for the very best from a given appellation reflecting overall quality and depth in style. For example, in Chablis we appreciate there are merits in and demand for both oaked and unoaked Chablis. One is not better than the other, and we seek to select the very best growers making each style.\u201dWorking with family estates is paramount with a view to cultivating long term relationships, adds Roberts, who cites the company\u2019s ability to ship directly from its suppliers throughout the Covid-19 crisis is a \u201creflection of the strength of these relationships and the producers\u2019 willingness to go the added mile to support us\u201d.\u201cThe fact that many of the leading global estates, including numerous Bordeaux chateaux, are prepared to send us new release samples shows the mutual respect we enjoy. We never want to stand still.\u201dThis year, company highlights include the release of the 2008 Champagne vintage, which was an \u201cextraordinary success\u201d, according to Georgina Crawley, business development director, thanks to the merchant\u2019s close relationships with many of the major Champagne houses. Crawley also highlighted its combined campaign on Brunello 2015 and Barolo/Barbaresco 2016, and the expansion of its range with wines from Spain, USA, Australia and South Africa.While founder and chairman, Johnny Goedhuis, continues to be active in the business, CEO Tom Stopford Sackville and managing director, Justin Randall, head up the board. The merchant also has a separate storage business, Private Reserves Ltd., based in Northamptonshire, and in 2008 opened its first international office in Hong Kong.= 5. BIFounded: 1997Turnover: 2018 \u00a399m, vs \u00a380m in 2017 up 24% (NB: Most recent records available on Companies House)BI was founded by South African-born Gary Boom with the aim of making the \u201cworld of fine wine accessible to a broader audience\u201d. Today the company has offices in London, Hong Kong, Singapore and Los Angeles, and in 2009 launched LiveTrade, the world\u2019s first online wine trading platform.While BI is particularly strong on Bordeaux, which has accounted for a third of its sales this year, it also offers a diverse portfolio of wines from other regions. In the first four months of 2020, sales of its Italian wines have risen by 38%, which follows on a from a 30% increase during 2019, while in the last month demand for US wines has increased by almost 50%, it reports. UK sales of rare wines and spirits increased by 32% during April, after a cautious March period, where investors \u201cdigested the impact of the coronavirus\u201d.\u201cCurrently there is good momentum behind US and Italian wines (the best performers in the last six months, particularly Tuscan wines where the 2015 and 2016 vintages have been very strong), so we would allocate slightly more of the portfolio than usual to these regions, alongside Bordeaux as a core backbone (including taking advantage of the current market opportunities), Champagne, and also Burgundy where we continue to see performance potential in the prime segment e.g. Rousseau,\u201d says Matthew O\u2019Connell, BI\u2019s head of investment.Whisky has also fared well with sales rising by 110% in the first four months of the year, driven by The Macallan and Bowmore as well as Japan\u2019s Karuizawa, with the prices of top whiskies achieving gains of almost 10% so far in 2020.On the current pandemic, BI has been largely insulated from impact. \u201cWe have easily adjusted to moving to remote working and utilising the available technology,\u201d adds O\u2019Connell. \u201cGiven were already online with LiveTrade, we were ahead of the transition precipitated by the pandemic.\u20194. JeroboamsFounded: 1934Locations: Knightsbridge, Belgravia (Elizabeth Street and Post Street), Holland park, Notting Hill, Kensington, Hampstead, Muswell HillTurnover: 2019 \u00a325.8 vs \u00a324.2m in 2018, up 6.9%Jeroboams was born of Laytons, a wine merchant founded \u201cby restaurateurs, for restaurants\u201d in 1934. Under Laytons, the company built a strong reputation as wine suppliers to the on-trade, but expanded in 1985 to include private customers under the name Jeroboams. There are now eight bricks and mortar Jeroboams shops across London, with Jeroboams and Laytons formally merging in 2007 to create the Jeroboams Group.Of the company\u2019s successes in the past year, Hugh Sturges, managing director, said: \u201cPrior to the recent turmoil caused by Covid-19, 2019/20 represented the final year of a four-year investment plan. Over this period, with strong shareholder support, Jeroboams has invested in latest generation systems, the refreshment of the brand and its look and feel, its people (in terms of training, development and career opportunity), its shops (including two new sites) and its product range. This culminated in 2019 with us having the confidence to host our first major consumer tasting at RIBA in the summer and in 2020, last week in fact, the launch of our new purpose built and mobile friendly transactional website.\u201dAs for its wine selection, the team\u2019s approach is firmly based on building relationships, some lasting over 30 years, and retaining exclusivity on certain labels as much as possible.\u201cAs the majority of our range is imported into the UK exclusively by us, we mostly choose to work with smaller producers as they tend to be a better fit with our business and have values that align clearly with ours,\u201d said Peter Mitchell MW, Jeroboams wine director. \u201cThere are clearly exceptions to this small producer ethos, notably in Champagne and Bordeaux, but the majority of our sourcing involves seeking out smaller producers whose scale makes it more difficult for them to find a home in our market and yet who are making some of the most exciting wines out there.\u201cWe want our range to offer different producers to others and those with a real passion for what they do and a story behind the label. Whilst we have a thriving business in fine mature wines, especially from Bordeaux and Burgundy, we have a real focus on wines from Italy, as we believe this to be one of the most exciting and dynamic producing countries in the world right now. We have recently also been looking at California and South Africa, where there are any number of rapidly improving wineries not currently in the UK market.\u201dThe merchant also offers a fine wine portfolio which is \u201cquite fluid as it relies on what is available at a keen price, from both our contacts around the globe and from our own client\u2019s reserves\u201d, adds Mitchell. Often parcels selected can be as few as six bottles.On the challenges faced by the current Covid-19 pandemic, Sturges notes the pace at which the company has had to adapt, looking after its employees while also protecting the business. Most of its shops are now open but opening hours have been restricted and reduced to a five-day week, while also introducing social distancing measures in store.\u201cOur business with the hospitality sector has obviously taken a terrible hit with sales down by 80%+,\u201d he said. \u201cNecessarily we are taking advantage of the Employment Retention Scheme, but we are also keeping on some people whose primary role is to communicate with the trade customer base, seeing how we can help or just having a chat.\u201cFinally, and very importantly, we have increased the resource available for building our mobile-led transactional web platform. This was scheduled to be completed in 2020 anyway but we have brought things forward, focusing on this over the last eight weeks, and I am very pleased to say that the site went live last week. I am optimistic that this will help mitigate some of the on trade sales losses as well as giving us the fourth arm for the business once things return to something resembling normality.\u201d3. Lea & SandemanFounded: 1988Locations: Chelsea, Fulham, Kensington, Barnes and ChiswickTurnover: 2018 \u00a311.4m vs. \u00a311.4 in 2017. 0% change. (To 31 December 2018. Most recent accounts filed at Companies House)Known for its original and diverse selection, Lea & Sandeman was founded in 1988 by Charles Lea and Patrick Sandeman with the aim of bringing the \u201cfull service\u201d of a traditional wine merchant to the High Street. In addition to offering wines for immediate drinking, it also offers Bordeaux, Burgundy, Rh\u00f4ne and Italian wines en primeur and offers a range of other services to clients including cellar-planning and brokering.Its first shop opened on the Fulham Road, with its locations since expanding to include Chelsea, Kensington, Barnes and Chiswick. In 2018, the merchant was granted a Royal Warrant of Appointment to Her Majesty the Queen, which coincided with its 30th anniversary.Lea & Sandeman is about wines to drink \u2013 not just wines that impress at tastings,\u201d has long been its mission statement, and it has succeeded in bridging the divide between everyday drinking and fine wines, offering value for money in either spectrum.\u201cMore important than meeting price points, Lea and Sandeman is about value for money,\u201d it adds. \u201cFrom the very beginning this meant sourcing wines direct from growers. Although many of the domaines and growers on our list today are the same as when we started, our range has developed over the years, reflecting the introduction of both traditional and innovative producers. We are not name-buyers, we are quality buyers.\u201dWhile all Lea & Sandeman shops remain open, the merchant has recently overhauled its website, making purchasing wine online a more seamless experience, which in times such as these is more welcome than ever.2. Philglas & SwiggotFounded: 1991Locations: Marylebone and Battersea shopsTurnover: Not publicly availablePhilglas & Swiggot was founded in 1991 on Northcote Road in Battersea by Mike and Karen Rogers, and over the next 23 years expanded to include shops in both Marylebone and Richmond, and later Battersea. In November 2018, O\u2019Briens Wine purchased the business, having already established itself in Ireland with 34 stores to its name since 1973. Philglas & Swiggot is now managed by Marcus O\u2019Brien with Justin Knock MW and Lynne Coyle MW (wine director for O\u2019Briens in Ireland) overseeing its range.According to Knock, prior to the current pandemic Philglas & Swiggot had been enjoying its best ever trading months, \u201cevery single month this year\u201d. In the past year, the company had worked hard to improve its online offering, which has paid off given this year\u2019s challenges, while Knock has had more time to expand the company\u2019s focus on its private clients, an area of the business that he says has \u201cgrown substantially\u201d this year.\u201cThe team has grown, adding skills and experience in areas that have improved the business and enabled existing people to focus on their competencies \u2013 business management, commercial positioning, fine wine buying and sales, on-trade \u2013 and this has made a huge difference,\u201d says Knock. \u201cThe areas of biggest impact have been online, which has had a full upgrade and now links seamlessly with stock in stores to be more comprehensive and more accurate.\u201dIt also carried out an extensive refurbishment of its Marylebone store into a wine bar, entering the on-trade at a somewhat difficult period. \u201cWhile its completion came just before the virus crisis it means the business has a new sales and marketing channel when things begin to normalise,\u201d adds Knock.On its range, Knock works to place particular focus on New World wines, particularly Australia, South Africa, California, with a \u201cdistinctive character\u201d, alongside Italy, Germany, Spain, France and Greece, the latter being a personal favourite.\u201cAs a retailer it\u2019s not only important to have great wine quality, we want wine that has fantastic presentation too \u2013 customers want to be proud and excited to have the bottle at home \u2013 and in a world of endless choice we have the privilege of being able to ask for both,\u201d explains Knock. \u201cIt means that if you see a wine with an horrendous label in our store the wine quality must be absolutely spectacular.\u201dThe business has been able to continue trading throughout the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown \u201cexcept for a few days in March,\u201d says Knock. \u201cWe\u2019ve very quickly upgraded the online store which has been incredible the way it has grown.\u201dExtra staff have been hired to make more deliveries and in-store perspex screens have been installed, along with floor markings and restricted access to three customers at a time. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t affected daily turnover at all but makes everyone feel more comfortable,\u201d says Knock. \u201cTrading hours have been slightly reduced while staff have been provided staff with gloves while Downton Distillers have very donated a bottomless supply of hand sanitiser for use by everyone on the street.\u201cIt\u2019s become evident that many people will continue to buy online and we expect that to become more and more important over time,\u201d adds Knock.1. HedonismFounded: 2012Locations: Mayfair shop, Hide restaurantTurnover: 2018 \u00a329.4 vs. \u00a320.7m in 2017, up 42% (NB: Most recent accounts filed on Companies House)A behemoth of wine retail, Hedonism has very quickly established itself as a firm fixture on London\u2019s wine scene since its founding in 2012. Not least due to its impressive wonderland-like retail space in Mayfair, a space that is as much of pleasure to peruse as it is to purchase its wines, but for its recent foray into the on-trade with the opening of Hide.The shop was closed for a period during lockdown, however the team continued to work behind closed doors, hosting online wine tastings, which have become an \u201cinstant hit\u201d, while also offering click and collect orders and deliveries. The shop has since reopened between 12-7pm Monday to Saturday and 12-6pm on Sundays, with social distancing enforced.In the past year, the business has redeveloped its website making online shopping more \u201cseamless and intuitive\u201d, says Tatiana Fokina, CEO of Hide and Hedonism. \u201cThe timing of it was perfect as we managed to launch the site just before the pandemic. April online sales have been 4.5 times the figure this time last year.\u201dWith regard to its wine selection, Hedonism is renowned for having one of the most diverse and coveted collection of wines and spirits under one roof, with wines priced from the sub \u00a330 category up to \u00a3100,000. (Currently a bottle of 2015 Petrus is on sale at \u00a3108,000, and a 1847 Yquem for \u00a395,000).\u201cWe pride ourselves on the breadth and depth of our range and the knowledge of the team that is able to source all these amazing wines and spirits,\u201d says Fokina. \u201cQuality is paramount. It can be an obscure wine from a new producer \u2013 if the quality is there it will make it to the shelve. We offer something for every budget having over 600 lines under \u00a330 and every taste. From entry level, approachable and affordable products to complex rarities, collectible and unique bottles.\u201dOn the current challenge faced by wine merchants, Fokina is counts Hedonism lucky to have retained the support of its regular customers. \u201cAs we have our own small fleet of electric delivery vans and have over the years finessed our logistics and warehousing systems we could continue our London and UK deliveries as usual,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do still ship internationally and although there might be slight delays, these are minimal. We are down to a core team in the store as safety of our staff is crucial and currently we are putting together a plan to hopefully re-open our doors once it is prudent to do so.\u201d",

            "description": "The Shanghai Stock Exchange is considering the first overhaul of its benchmark index in three decades so that it better reflects China\u2019s increasingly high-tech economy, according to people familiar with the matter.The exchange is planning to adjust the timing for newly listed stocks to be included in the index and remove some chronically loss-making shares, said two of the people, who asked not to be identified as the matter is private. As part of a long-term overhaul under consideration, the exchange may also calculate a company\u2019s market value for the index based on its free float rather than total outstanding shares, said the people.The overhaul would bring the Shanghai index more in line with gauges like the S&P 500, which calculates market value based on the free float available for trading, as opposed to the total shares, which include closely held stock owned by insiders. Given the government control of many Chinese companies, the free float on stocks like the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. is small.If approved, that shift could lead to increased weightings for technology and other new economy sectors and reduce financial services and energy, said two of the people. The bourse is also evaluating whether to include stocks listed on the tech-heavy STAR board into the index, and may create a separate gauge for STAR stocks, one of the people said.\u201cThere has been ages-long criticism that the Shanghai composite index did not reflect the real economy, which could be a problem given the number of investors and funds tracking it,\u201d said Ge Shoujing, a senior analyst at the Reality Institute of Advanced Finance in Beijing.Changes to the methodology are still under review and will reflect market feedback, said the people. A representative from the exchange declined to comment.Range boundLaunched in 1991, the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index tracks 1,555 stocks on the bourse in China\u2019s financial hub. The index has remained little changed, hovering around 3,000 points over the past 10 years while the S&P 500 Index has climbed more than 171%, partly because the China gauge hasn\u2019t captured the country\u2019s fast-growing new economy. Eight of the top 10 stocks in the index are financial or energy firms.\u201cThe revamp will finally break the curse of the Shanghai composite being perpetually stuck at 3,000, as retail investors like to joke about in dark humor,\u201d said Wang Zhuo, fund manager at Shanghai Zhuozhu Investment Management Co. Ltd. He said it will \u201cboost morale\u201d of investors convinced that there\u2019s no hope of making money from China stocks.Financial dominanceLiquor giant Kweichow Moutai Co. tops the index weighting at 5.2%, while financial firms including Industrial & Commercial Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. make up more than a third of the weighting. The industrial sector, which includes PetroChina Co., makes up more than 16% of the capitalization-weighted index.One challenge for the exchange is the lack of big technology names. Most of the tech and internet giants in China, such as JD.com Inc., Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. trade in New York or Hong Kong.Li Xunlei, chief economist at Zhongtai Securities Co., said that the exchange should act \u201csooner rather than later\u201d to consider revamping the index by including stocks traded on the STAR board and removing chronically loss-making firms. The STAR board of start-up technology stocks was launched by the exchange last year.Analysts also welcomed the potential change in listing requirements. Under current rules, companies can join the index on the 11th day after their initial public offering, meaning the index fails to capture their gains in the first few days of trading.\u201cBy the time they are included, these stocks have, or are close to peaking,\u201d Wang said.The exchange will take steps to avoid a sudden rise or fall in the index as a result of the overhaul, said the people, adding that changes will be gradual with new entries added over time.

Well, we\u2019ve done the hard work for you, and rounded up five brilliant Proseccos for under \u00a310, following the UK\u2019s largest sampling of this popular Italian sparkling.All these wines deliver the wonderful qualities of Prosecco, but without the high cost that can come with sourcing brilliant fizz.Selected from the best sub \u00a310 performers in the Prosecco Masters 2020, which is the largest annual blind tasting of Prosecco in the UK, each one has been independently assessed without any knowledge of the producer responsible for crafting the sparkling wine.While they may not represent the ultimate expressions of this Italian product (although you can see those by clicking here), each of the wines below scored highly for their quality to price ratio, delivering Prosecco\u2019s appealing mix of peach and pear flavours along with its soft creamy mouth-cleansing fizz.So please read on to discover the best value Proseccos on the market today, and to find out more about how they were selected.5.

In the mouth this is clean and pure, with masses of apricot, almost like fizzy Viognier. Such flavours are complemented by a smooth, creamy mousse, and while it\u2019s quite sweet, there is enough brightness to refresh on the finish. Overall, an appealing Prosecco in a fruity style \u2013 and very good for the price.4. Passaparola Prosecco Spumante DOC, Brut, NVProducer: Pradio VineyardsVintage: Non-vintageResidual sugar: 12g/lMedal: Gold \u2013 The Prosecco Masters 2020Leading with an inviting set of aromatics from apple and pear, and a touch of peach, this is a fruity Prosecco that pleases the palate with a smooth-textured fizz, a hint of sweetness, and a chalky refreshing edge. Balanced and mouth-filling, this is a Prosecco that packs a lot of punch for the cash.3. Costellore Prosecco Spumante DOC, Extra Dry, NVProducer: Fratelli MartiniVintage: Non-vintageResidual sugar: 15g/lMedal: Gold \u2013 The Prosecco Masters 2020Pretty aromatics from orange blossom to peach and pear fruit. Then, a full, sweet sensation in the mouth, followed by some ripe apple on the finish, giving a feeling of freshness, despite the obvious sweetness. A balanced, full-on fizz for the money.2. Riunite Prosecco DOC Treviso Spumante Extra Dry, NVProducer: Cantine RiuniteVintage: Non-vintageResidual sugar: 13g/lMedal: Silver \u2013 The Prosecco Masters 2020Pleasing aromatics and flavours of peach and pear drop, with a clean, fresh finish makes this a good, bright Prosecco in a lighter style.1.

Blant annet NHH-professor Guttorm Schjelderup har advart mot interessekonflikter.\u2013 Norges Bank og Nicolai Tangen selv har lagt stor vekt p\u00e5 at han har kuttet alle b\u00e5nd som kan tenkes \u00e5 skape interessekonflikter for ham som ny leder for Oljefondet. Han burde legge frem en fullstendig oversikt over sine forretningsmessige avtaler og stiftelsesdokumentene for sine truster, sa Schjelderup til E24 onsdag.Professoren og kollega Tina S\u00f8reide stilte ogs\u00e5 sp\u00f8rsm\u00e5l til at Tangens fond og stiftelse er registrert i ulike skatteparadiser som De britiske Jomfru\u00f8yer og Jersey.\u2013 Det er viktig at Norges Bank har en tillitvekkende prosess.

            "description": "As the fifth installment in an ongoing series that explores the 11 major economic sectors in China, this piece provides an in-depth look at the key stats, notable companies, and thematic tailwinds that characterize China\u2019s Consumer Staples sector, tracked by the Global X MSCI China Consumer Staples ETF (CHIS).BackgroundSince the 1980\u2019s, China\u2019s population dramatically shifted from a largely rural, agrarian society, to one defined by middle class city dwellers. The profound effects of this shift continue to impact China\u2019s economy today, as citizens\u2019 rising wages drive the formation of new consumption habits to fit their urban lifestyles. One area that exemplifies these changes is the non-discretionary component of Chinese consumer purchases. Rather than depending on one\u2019s own farm or on a local markets for everyday food and goods, Chinese consumers are increasingly turning to stores for manufactured goods like snack foods, beverages, and home supplies.Due to shifting preferences and a growing consumer class, the Consumer Staples sector exemplifies both growth-like and defensive characteristics. Sales growth expectations for the sector are 2.5 times higher than US Staples. Yet last year, Consumer Staples was the best performing sector in China amid an outbreak of swine flu and protracted trade tensions, which truncated supply and initiated a shift towards more defensive assets.1 In the first quarter of 2020, amid unprecedented disruption from COVID-19, Consumer Staples continued to outperform the broad MSCI China Index benchmark, leading it by 7.8% through March 10th.2China Consumer Staples: Sector Breakdown and Key StatsChina\u2019s Consumer Staples sector experienced rapid growth over the last decade as the economy and middle class expanded. The sector\u2019s total market cap multiplied nearly 10x, from approximately $70 bn in 2010 to more than $700 bn by the end of 2019.3 The sector, however, is still only a third of the size of its US counterpart, which stands at roughly $2.1 tn.4 In addition, Staples represents just 4% of the broad MSCI China Index whereas US Consumer Staples make up approximately 8% of the S&P 500.5 This is all despite the fact that China has a larger middle class than the entire population of the United States.China\u2019s Consumer Staples sector is largely domestically-focused, which is evident by its high domestic revenue exposure (roughly 98%).6 The sector includes several of the largest companies listed in mainland China, driving A share representation to a high 47%. By comparison, only 16% of the Consumer Discretionary sector is A shares.7 Given the high proportion of A shares, access to the sector for international investors was largely limited until just a few years ago when China democratized access to the onshore equity market via the Stock Connect program and subsequently many of these companies became included in major emerging market indexes.Less than 1% of the Consumer Staples sector are state-owned enterprises, whereas companies in older sectors like Materials, Energy, Utilities, and Financials, tend to be more export-oriented and have between 34-40% SOE representation.Recent demand for defensive exposures and strong performance caused valuations for China\u2019s Staples sector to expand. While China\u2019s markets typically trade at a discount to the US, the Consumer Staples sector features valuations that are similar to its US sector counterpart, as demonstrated by price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and forward Price to Sales (Fwd. P/S) multiples.8 China\u2019s Staples sector remains cheaper, however, from a price-to-book (P/B) metric and is projected to experience higher sales growth over the coming year.9American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are stocks of Chinese companies listed on American stock exchanges. A shares are listed on domestic stock exchanges in China and have been historically difficult to access. P Chips are stocks of companies operating in China, listed in Hong Kong, and incorporated in the Cayman or British Virgin Islands. Red Chips are stocks of companies based in China, incorporated abroad, and listed in Hong Kong. H shares are stocks of companies incorporated in China and listed in Hong Kong. Holdings are subject to change.Industry BreakdownFour major industries make up China\u2019s Consumer Staples sector. Roughly half of the sector is made up of Food Products, a third by the Beverage industry, and nearly 15% split between Personal Products and Foods & Staples Retailing.Holdings are subject to changeFood Products: China\u2019s Food Products industry is competitive between domestic firms, and increasingly so with international competitors that are lured by the enormous potential of China\u2019s market. Two of the industry\u2019s biggest companies in China \u2013 China Mengniu and Inner Mongolia Yili \u2013 control over 40% of the dairy market, which has expanded beyond milk and eggs to yogurt and big foreign brands. Competition is especially strong within the growing snacks segment of the industry, growing alongside the urbanization trend.10INDUSTRY LEADERS: China Mengniu Dairy, Want Want China, TingyiBeverages: Moutai is an alcoholic beverage and is the national drink of China. As a type of Baiju, Moutai is made of wheat and sorghum, and is increasingly popular both in China and abroad. Drinks such as Moutai give the sector some discretionary qualities because of the growing appetite for higher-quality alcoholic beverages and the increasing popularity of these drinks abroad. China is also one of the world\u2019s largest beer markets and is home to industry leaders such as Tsingtao.INDUSTRY LEADERS: China Resources Beer, Kweichow Moutai, Wuliangye YibinPersonal Products: this industry supplies China\u2019s populations with sanitary napkins, baby and adult diapers, and other personal hygiene products. Companies like Hengan International are finding new ways to unlock potential growth opportunities, including the integration of technology or e-commerce platforms, in the same way Procter & Gamble successfully did with its products in the United States.INDUSTRY LEADERS: Hengan International, By-health, Shanghai Jahwa UnitedFood & Staples Retailing: This industry is China\u2019s equivalent to Walmart, Target, and Kroger, and remains relatively insulated from outside competition. These companies work closely with distribution platforms and technology providers like Taobao and Alibaba to help product manufacturers scale and distribute their products at a national level. Convenience stores, supermarkets, and hypermarket companies in China also benefit from vast data on China\u2019s population, and deep international supply chains, which they use to prevent foreign rivals from competing on price and variety.INDUSTRY LEADERS: Sun Art Retail, Yonghui Superstores, Yifeng PharmacyFor Top 10 Holdings of CHIS please click here. Holdings are subject to change.Current and future holdings are subject to risk.Headwinds & Tailwinds: Demographics, Policies, and TrendsTailwinds: Despite the destabilizing impact of COVID-19 this year, companies in the Consumer Staples sector remain well-positioned as consumers prioritize buying basic goods. As transmission of the virus decelerates in China, the sector is expected to return to its longer-term growth story, drafting behind growing consumption trends in China.Consumerism: Much of China\u2019s population relocated to cities in pursuit of higher wages and therefore greater disposable income. Since 2010, the percentage of the population living in cities increased by nearly 3% annually and the disposable income of urban households increased by nearly 10% per annum. 12 Consumption overall is growing faster than GDP as the government orchestrates an economy-wide shift from manufacturing to consumerism. According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), retail spending alone rose 9.1% y-o-y in 2018 and 5% in 2019, while GDP increased 6.6% and 6.1% respectively. 13 Looking forward, consumption is forecasted to continue growing by an average of 6% annually as the country becomes more consumption-oriented. 14Much of China\u2019s population relocated to cities in pursuit of higher wages and therefore greater disposable income.

Government Support: China\u2019s government plays a critical role in boosting consumption throughout the country. In 2019, the government instated cuts on Individual Income Tax (IIT) designed to increase overall spending by individuals. In response to the coronavirus outbreak, local governments are distributing prepaid vouchers to encourage consumption. In some cities, like Nanjing, which planned $45 million of distributions, vouchers are targeted at supporting the most vulnerable, including lower-income earners and union members, to prevent a contraction in consumption.China\u2019s government plays a critical role in boosting consumption throughout the country.

International Trade: After a difficult 18 months of trade tensions with the US, Chinese Consumer Staples companies may see the international climate slowly improve with the signing of the Phase One agreement and future negotiations for a Phase Two deal. Under Phase One, tariffs on food and agriculture cut into some firms\u2019 margins. Should these tariffs reverse, input costs should normalize allowing for margins to expand.After a difficult 18 months of trade tensions with the US, Chinese Consumer Staples companies may see the international climate slowly improve with the signing of the Phase One agreement and future negotiations for a Phase Two deal. Under Phase One, tariffs on food and agriculture cut into some firms\u2019 margins. Should these tariffs reverse, input costs should normalize allowing for margins to expand. Partnerships and M&A: Strategic partnerships and M&A are increasingly common across the Staples sector, whether in production, distribution, expansion, or digital transformation. By helping modernize older companies with the implementation of digital transformation strategies, these partnerships should help drive additional growth within the industry.HeadwindsAging Population : As a result of China\u2019s one-child policy, longer life expectancies, and declining birth rates, China\u2019s senior population is growing rapidly. During the years that the one-child policy was in effect, life expectancy in China extended from 67 to 75 and fertility rates decreased from 2.8 to 1.7. China\u2019s ageing population presents considerable social and economic challenges, including headwinds against future consumption.: As a result of China\u2019s one-child policy, longer life expectancies, and declining birth rates, China\u2019s senior population is growing rapidly.

China\u2019s ageing population presents considerable social and economic challenges, including headwinds against future consumption. Increased International Competition: PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble, and Walmart have been in China for decades. And while they have strategic partnerships with leading Chinese companies and e-commerce platforms, these firms have largely struggled to gain a foothold within China. As Chinese markets continue to liberalize foreign investment, and demand for western goods grows, international firms will penetrate the competitive landscape in China.PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble, and Walmart have been in China for decades. And while they have strategic partnerships with leading Chinese companies and e-commerce platforms, these firms have largely struggled to gain a foothold within China. As Chinese markets continue to liberalize foreign investment, and demand for western goods grows, international firms will penetrate the competitive landscape in China. Private Labeling: Private labeling is when third parties produce goods for a retailer. It is a popular trend in the food and beverage industry in developed markets and is beginning to pick up in China, as well as the broader emerging markets. Private labeling may encourage competition and greater consumption, but could also work against established name-brands.ConclusionWith the world\u2019s largest population, and second largest economy and equity market, some might expect China\u2019s Consumer Staples sector to be a global leader by market cap. However, the sector is still in its infancy, suggesting substantial future growth potential. As China transitions to a middle-income economy fueled by domestic consumption, Beijing will continue to rely on the country\u2019s enormous middle class to drive growth. Given the size of the consumer base and their distinct preferences, domestic firms within the China Consumer Staples sector are among the best-positioned to potentially benefit from this long-term shift. At the same time, Consumer Staples firms have exhibited more resilience against growth shocks, like global health crises and trade tensions, a defensive element to the sector.Related ETFs:CHIS: The Global X MSCI Consumer Staples ETF seeks to invest in large- and mid-capitalization segments of the MSCI China Index that are classified in the Consumer Staples Sector as per the Global Industry Classification System (GICS).",

            "description": "Les ETF Chine sont int\u00e9ressants pour miser sur la reprise \u00e9conomique du continent asiatique. Le Coronavirus est en phase de d\u00e9clin dans le pays. Aujourd\u2019hui, c\u2019est le deuxi\u00e8me jour cons\u00e9cutif o\u00f9 on n\u2019y d\u00e9nombre aucun nouveau cas.L\u2019\u00e9conomie chinoise, comme son homologue am\u00e9ricaine, est particuli\u00e8rement dynamique. Seulement, le Coronavirus va seulement s\u2019y d\u00e9velopper de fa\u00e7on exponentielle. Il est donc peut-\u00eatre un peu t\u00f4t pour acheter un tracker sur le S&P 500, mais on peut d\u2019ores et d\u00e9j\u00e0 parier sur une reprise \u00e9conomique de l\u2019Empire du Milieu en investissant dans un ETF Chine.Il n\u2019en existe malheureusement plus des milliers encore disponibles pour les investisseurs francophones suite au r\u00e8glement PRIIP et son obligation pour les \u00e9metteurs de traduire les documents-cl\u00e9s des ETFs en fran\u00e7ais.Avant d\u2019aller plus loin, je tiens \u00e0 souligner que les 5 ETF Chine pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s ci-dessous poss\u00e8dent tous les caract\u00e9ristiques suivantes, que je trouve tr\u00e8s importantes :R\u00e9plication physique (ils poss\u00e8dent r\u00e9ellement le panier d\u2019actions)Une bonne liquidit\u00e9 (le plus liquide des cinq \u00e9tant le iShares MSCI China)Ils sont tous les cinq domicili\u00e9s en IrlandeETF Chine n\u00b01 : HSBC MSCI ChinaISIN : IE00B44T3H88Frais : 0,30%Ce premier tracker est un ETF de distribution. Cela signifie qu\u2019il distribue ses dividendes deux fois par an. Ses frais annuels de 0,30% en font le deuxi\u00e8me tracker le moins cher de cette liste.C\u2019est surtout sa composition qui rend cet ETF si int\u00e9ressant : 16,78% d\u2019Alibaba et 12,92% de Tencent. Le r\u00eave pour ceux qui, comme moi, croient en l\u2019avenir de ces deux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s.Le reste est plus basique avec 3,91% de China Construction Bank, 3,46% de Ping An Insurance, 2,41% de China Mobile, etc. De petites pond\u00e9rations par rapport aux deux premi\u00e8res.L\u2019inconv\u00e9nient est que cela en fait un tracker moins diversifi\u00e9 que les deux autres, m\u00eame s\u2019il est compos\u00e9 de 707 participations au total. Mais comme disait le bon vieux Warren : La diversification n\u2019est qu\u2019une protection contre l\u2019ignorance. Elle n\u2019est pas importante si vous savez ce que vous faites.Il est aussi \u00e0 noter que pour ceux qui poss\u00e8dent un compte DEGIRO, il fait partie des 200 ETFs qui sont gratuits \u00e0 la n\u00e9gociation chez ce courtier (conditions applicables). C\u2019est important pour pouvoir s\u2019adonner \u00e0 l\u2019investissement programm\u00e9 et \u00e0 la gestion passive par exemple.Lire aussi : La Gestion Passive, La M\u00e9thode d\u2019Investissement La Plus Simple, La Plus Reposante Et\u2026 La Plus Efficace ?ETF Chine n\u00b02 : iShares MSCI ChinaISIN : IE00BQT3WG13Frais : 0,40%Ce deuxi\u00e8me ETF, le plus liquide des trois, est un tracker de capitalisation. Cela signifie qu\u2019il ne verse pas les dividendes : ceux-ci sont automatiquement r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9s dans le cours de bourse par le gestionnaire du tracker. L\u2019avantage est que vous \u00e9chappez \u00e0 la taxe belge ou fran\u00e7aise de 30% sur les dividendes par rapport \u00e0 un ETF de distribution.La liqueur Kweichow MoutaiIl r\u00e9plique l\u2019indice MSCI China A Inclusion, qui est compos\u00e9 des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s suivantes : 4,63% de Kweichow Moutai, 4,11% de BlackRock ICS Liquid Agency, 2,94% de Ping An, 2,46% de China Merchants Bank, 1,63% de Wuliangye Yibin\u2026Ce sont en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des entreprises moins connues des occidentaux, mais, les 467 actions le composant \u00e9tant pr\u00e9sentes chacune en petite quantit\u00e9, cela en fait un ETF assez diversifi\u00e9. Son principal avantage par rapport aux deux autres \u00e9tant ses frais r\u00e9duits ; 0,40%.ETF Chine n\u00b03 : iShares China Large CapISIN : IE00B02KXK85Frais : 0,74%Ce troisi\u00e8me tracker, le plus co\u00fbteux des trois avec 0,74% de frais annuels, est un ETF de distribution. Mais contrairement au premier de la liste, il distribue ses dividendes chaque trimestre.C\u2019est un tracker moins diversifi\u00e9 que les deux autres puisqu\u2019il r\u00e9plique l\u2019indice FTSE China 50, donc poss\u00e8de uniquement 50 actions chinoises dans son panier.Sa premi\u00e8re participation est Tencent avec 10,13%, suivie de 9,17% de China Construction Bank, et 7,83% de Ping An.Le fait d\u2019\u00eatre compos\u00e9 de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u00e9j\u00e0 bien \u00e9tablies fait que son rendement de dividende est sup\u00e9rieur : 2,64% \u00e0 l\u2019heure o\u00f9 j\u2019\u00e9cris ces lignes.

Li, who has hit the mandated retirement age of 62, will step down from both his post as chair of Kweichow Moutai Group and its unit, the report said.Guizhou People\u2019s Government put forward the 48-year-old Gao as a candidate to replace Li, according to the announcement.Li was transferred from his position as director of the Guizhou Economic and Information Commission, now known as Guizhou Department of Industry and Information Technology, to general manager of Kweichow Moutai Group in 2015, the report said.His forerunner Yuan Renguo was yanked out amid corruption and bribe-taking charges.The group\u2019s operating revenue climbed from 36.3 billion yuan (US$5.2 billion) to more than 100 billion yuan and became China\u2019s first liquor producer during Li\u2019s tenure. He also bolstered anti-corruption efforts and reformed its dealership system, the report said.Distilled from a mash of sorghum, Maotai is named after the town of the same name near Zunyi in the remote mountainous province, where distilling has a very long tradition.Today\u2019s Maotai, which emerged during the Qing dynasty (1644 to 1912), came into international prominence after winning a gold medal at the Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco in 1915.Gao Weidong, ex-head of Guizhou province\u2019s transport department, at right, becomes chairman of Kweichow Moutai, replacing Li Baofang, at left.

            "description": "China\u2019s economy: what you need to knowChina is the second-largest economy in the world in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) and is expected to overtake the US frontrunner in the not-so-distant future. It is already the biggest when measured by purchasing power parity.Despite its size and the influence this gives the country on the world stage, China continues to grow at more than twice the average rate of the rest of the world, making it the engine of global growth. So much so that, over the past 30 years, since it began to open up and reform itself in 1978, China\u2019s share of the world economy has ballooned from below 2% to over 16% today.It is China\u2019s role as the world\u2019s factory, accounting for over one fifth of all manufacturing, that has driven the country\u2019s expansion.China\u2019s annual growth has averaged over 10% during the last three decades but this has slowed significantly in recent years. The 6.1% growth reported in 2019 was the slowest on record since 1990, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts that will slow further over the foreseeable future.China is transforming its economy...The expansion of the Chinese economy has to date been driven by cheap labour manufacturing goods that are then exported to the rest of the world. However, this has long been regarded as unsustainable and responsible for creating economic, social and environmental imbalances. For example, the IMF says investment still accounts for 45% of GDP, over double that of the US. GDP per head is still low, at just over $15,000 compared to nearly $50,000 for advanced economies, and the country is by far the world\u2019s largest polluter, emitting more carbon dioxide than the US, India, Russia and Japan \u2013 the four next biggest emitters - combined.But China is trying to follow in the footsteps of advanced countries. It is transforming its economy by moving away from offering cheap labour to produce cheap goods for the rest of the world to one built on more sophisticated and lucrative industries, such as technology and services, and led more by wage growth and the consumption of its burgeoning population of 1.4 billion people. This will leave the cheap manufacturing of goods to other countries that can offer lower labour costs, such as Vietnam.How to invest in VietnamThe country is aiming to do it swiftly too. In 2015, the government released a ten-year plan named \u2018Made by China 2025\u2019, which is supposed to reflect a move away from the \u2018Made in China\u2019 model that it is currently known for. This detailed plan is about making China a leading force in the next generation of technologies that are often touted to unleash the fourth industrial revolution, such as robotics, artificial intelligence (AI) and 5G telecommunications.Made by China 2025: everything you need to know\u2026 But this has its consequencesChina is only halfway through this decade-long plan, but it is already making an impact by ensuring China is more influential on the world stage. Take Huawei and ZTE, two of the country\u2019s leading telecoms companies, as an example. They are regarded as leaders in 5G technology that is expected to unleash the full potential of other breakthroughs, including everything from autonomous vehicles to AI. It is argued that the US is beginning to lose important ground in the technological race to its biggest partner and rival. That argument has been emboldened after the UK government defied warnings from Washington, which had said Huawei\u2019s involvement in rolling out its 5G network could compromise the UK\u2019s security, by allowing them to play a limited role in its network.What you need to know about investing in 5GApart from the threat China poses to the dominance of American tech companies, the US and other western economies are sceptical of China\u2019s plans. The country is helping its businesses rise to the top by using government subsidies and leveraging state-owned enterprises, which the US has claimed is not in line with world trading standards. The US has long complained about China\u2019s use of subsidies to prop up Chinese firms and the fact it discriminates against foreign companies operating in the country. For example, it has long been accused of unfairly poaching technological advancements and intellectual property from foreign firms. Virtually every foreign company that wants to do business in China has to form a joint venture with a Chinese firm and share intellectual property (IP) and technology - and the US claims this has given the country the opportunity to pilfer secrets for its own benefit.This is the main reason why US President Donald Trump started his prolonged trade war with China. The US is keen to keep a lid on China\u2019s international expansion, such as in 5G, and to address the country\u2019s trading deficit with China.5G stocks: what industries will benefit from 5G?",

            "description": "NewsBy Patrick SchmittChampagne Lanson has unveiled a new slogan and advertising campaign as the brand embarks on a \u2018reconquest\u2019 to mark 260 years since its foundation in 1760.Launching this month is the Champagne house\u2019s new branding and advertising using the strapling \u2018It\u2019s all about love\u2019, which features a bottle of Lanson cradled in the hands of its winemaker: Herv\u00e9 Dantan (see picture, above).The campaign will be used worldwide, with Maison Lanson promising to use a range of hands holding the Champagne in future executions, from winegrowers to \u2018great chefs\u2019 and \u2018men and women who help bring Lanson Champagnes to life all over the world\u2019.The slogan replaces \u2018The perfect start since 1760\u2019, and the new message and imagery comes as part of a wider refresh for the house following the appointment of a new president in January last year \u2013 Franc\u0327ois Van Aal, who has held roles in advertising and luxury goods marketing, and most recently, a series of senior positions at Re\u0301my-Cointreau, where he has worked for 23 years.The house has also recruited a new marketing and communication director, Guillaume Truchot, who joined Lanson in May last year from Sarment Group in Singapore, where he was head of strategy and digital transformation, with former roles at Mo\u00ebt Hennessy, Laurent-Perrier and R\u00e9my Cointreau.Speaking to db in Champagne last month, Truchot said that the new marketing push for Lanson was part of a five-year plan for the brand, which he dubbed \u2018the reconquest\u2019.\u201cIt\u2019s part of a broader idea of where we come from, where we are going, and what we will do with the brand\u2026 but as it\u2019s 260 years old, we are not going to change things overnight,\u201d he said.Nevertheless, he admitted that during a close look at the house over the last six months, it became apparent that Lanson \u201cneeded some improvements and clarifications, so we have produced a masterplan, which covers production and marketing and communication.\u201dSuch analysis has led the house to identify a set of core values, which it has listed as \u201copenness, kindness, humility, authenticity and elegance \u2013 and above all else, the quality of its wines.\u201dAs for the new slogan, \u2018It\u2019s all about love\u2019 has been chosen to signify Lanson\u2019s \u201cLove for the soil, for the terroir, of a job well done, a sustainable love, a love of sharing, of being together, of making people happy.\u2019Meanwhile, Truchot said of the advertising imagery with the cradled bottle, \u201cIt is a different way of presenting a bottle of Champagne, because normally you see people sharing glasses, but here, the hero is the bottle, and the idea is that a lot of care goes into creating this bottle; it is Herv\u00e9\u2019s hands.\u201dContinuing he said, \u201cIt is a very emotional message; other houses have messages that are very product based, but we like to show that we are caring, and if you choose a bottle of Lanson, it is to show the love you have for those you are sharing it with.\u201dConcluding, he said, \u201cWe wanted to create a connection with consumers.\u201dAs for the changes to Lanson production, as opposed to marketing, Truchot told db that the team has been \u201cworking on the range too\u201d, which has now been rationalised, brining the number of Champagnes down from 15 to 10, meaning that \u201csome products will disappear over the coming months.\u201dBeing sacrificed to streamline the range will be the Lanson Extra Age set of multi-vintage cuv\u00e9es, as well as the Noble Cuv\u00e9e Ros\u00e9, while the Lanson Ivory Label will be \u201cmerged\u201d with the demi-sec White Label.Two new cuv\u00e9es will be added, with the maison\u2019s first ever non-vintage blanc de blancs being unveiled this year, as well as a \u2018Black Label Reserve\u2019, the latter seeing an extended period ageing in contact with its lees, and coming in place of the Lanson P\u00e8re & Fils, which was launched in 2015 specifically for restaurants.Finally, the house has tweaked the look of the labels, with a new appearance coming to the market in one year\u2019s time. As part of this the Royal Warrant will be \u201cmore visible\u201d, and located \u201cin the middle of the bottle, when before it was on the neck\u201d, according to Truchot.\u201cThere will also be a big change on the Lanson Vintage Champagnes, with the year much more prominently stated on the label, because we believe that if the consumer wants to enter the vintage category, it is through the year, and we tend to offer older vintages,\u201d he said.Finally, the mainstay of the range, the Lanson Black Label Brut NV, will get a \u201cmore premium look\u201d, with, for example, \u201ca lighter gold foil\u201d.In short, Truchot said, \u201cSo we have two big changes this year: a new range, including two new products, and a new communication and advertising campaign.\u201dConsumers can expect to see the new products and fresh marketing from June this year.",

These types of mouthwash typically come in pink (here's an example).You can also use rubbing alcohol to sanitise your hands.Using brandy, maotai, and vodka\"If we (are) desperate, we can use a strong alcohol such as brandy, maotai or vodka!\" Ho added.Known as China's \"national liquor\", maotai (or moutai) is a type of clear spirit (bai jiu) distilled from red sorghum. It is usually served at Chinese state banquets and presented as diplomatic gifts.You can get a 200ml bottle of maotai (53 per cent alcohol) on Lazada for a whooping S$256.That's some expensive improvised hand sanitiser.How to use mouthwash, alcohol to sanitise your hands\"Rub thoroughly including the back of hand and between fingers, and let dry naturally,\" wrote Ho.\"Then, use a baby lotion or other moisturisers, to prevent the hand from getting too dry. Symptoms of excessive dryness are peeling skin or redness.\"In an afternote, Ho also explained why alcohol can be used to protect yourself from coronaviruses.The Wuhan coronavirus, just like SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), are enveloped viruses where the outer \"envelope\" can get destroyed by sunlight, heat, alcohol, and mild disinfectants.Products with at least 40 per cent alcohol are effective, Ho added.\"Ethanol or ethyl alcohol is another name - this is what we drink and use for handrub or hand sanitiser. Methyl alcohol or methanol is the poisonous alcohol stuff which we should not drink. Most hand rubs also contain methanol - so don\u2019t drink your hand rub stuff, folks!\"You can read Ho's full post below:The reason why you might need to resort to using a S$256 hand sanitiser:Top images via Value Invest Asia and Licorea.",

[Photo by Liu Zhe/China Daily]A mouth-numbing spicy broth with 30 different seasonings. Floating isles of \"beef oil\". Slices of mutton that melt in the mouth.Your stomach is probably grumbling loudly before having a hotpot. But hold on. Just take a look at the diners in a queue that stretches out of sight down the sidewalk.Hotpot mania is on.It has lured dozens of diners to line up for hours at some popular hotpot restaurants both at home and abroad. It has also warmed up the appetites of merchants and investors despite the chill of a frigid winter.The figures speak for its popularity. The hotpot sector alone swallowed up over 20 percent of the market share in China's catering sector last year, making it the largest niche segment, said the China Hotel Association, which is responsible for serving catering and restaurants in the country.The hotpot industry exceeded 870 billion yuan ($125.7 billion) in sales revenue in 2018. The association estimated the market could rocket to around 960 billion yuan by the end of 2019, which is expected to catch up the total valuation of China's iconic distiller Kweichow Moutai Co Ltd.\"As the saying goes, there's nothing to worry about after having a hotpot. If you are still worried, then go for it twice,\" quipped Yu Jiaqing, a 28-year-old luxury brand marketing staffer from Beijing who has hotpot at least twice a week.\"As the food continues to boil in the broth, we keep drinking and chatting with each other. The atmosphere makes the time warm, too,\" said Yu. \"My friends and I become a bit addicted to this spicy dish, especially in the cold winter.\"For most Chinese like Yu, hotpot is usually a social event. A group of people sit around a table to eat, chat, drink some beer and just have a great time for several hours.A survey by Chenzhi Catering Database showed that 40.2 percent of Chinese usually eat hotpot with friends while 17.6 percent use the occasion for a family reunion.There were 516,000 hotpot restaurants in the country by the third quarter of 2019, growing rapidly by 11.6 percent year-on-year, China's on-demand service platform Meituan-Dianping estimated.",

Organic revenue growth was +10%.Groupwide, Europe and the US experienced good growth over the year, as did Asia, despite a difficult environment in Hong Kong in the second half.The Selective Retailing business group (which includes DFS Group and Starboard Cruise Services alongside Sephora and Le Bon March\u00e9) achieved organic revenue growth of +5%. Profit from recurring operations for this part of the business was up +1%.LVMH noted that preparations are underway for the imminent opening of DFS Group\u2019s new location at La Samaritaine in Paris this April.LVMH revenue growth in the fourth quarter reached +12% compared to the same period in 2018. Organic revenue growth was +8% for the quarter.

Operating margin reached 21.4%. Group share of net profit amounted to \u20ac7.2 billion (US$7.9 billion), up +13%.DFS faces first-half 2020 headwinds In a note, Morgan Stanley Research analyst Edouard Aubin points out that Selective Retailing\u2019s 4Q sales rose just +1% year-on-year (220 bps below market expectations), while operating profit contracted by -15%. \u201cWe believe that the shortfall came mostly from duty free chain DFS (about a third of the division\u2019s sales), which was very negatively impacted by its exposure to Hong Kong,\u201d he wrote. Morgan Stanley estimates that DFS generates over 30% of its sales in Hong Kong and that its sales were down over -40% year-on-year in 4Q (\u201crents are mostly fixed there so operating deleverage was material\u201d, notes Aubin). \u201cGoing forward, the performance of DFS should continue to drag that of the division in 1H20 and, as of June 2020, DFS will be negatively impacted by the termination of the historical Singapore airport concession (~\u20ac400m in annual sales but relatively minimal profit contribution), as well as the start-up costs associated with the opening of La Samaritaine in Paris,\u201d the note concluded.LVMH Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bernard Arnault said: \u201cLVMH had another record year, both in terms of revenue and results. The desirability of our brands, the creativity and quality of our products, the unique experience offered to our customers, and the talent and the commitment of our teams are the Group\u2019s strengths and have, once again, made the difference.\u201cIn addition to the many successes of our Maisons, highlights of the year include the arrival of the exceptional hotel group Belmond, the partnership with Stella McCartney and the agreement with prestigious jewellery Maison, Tiffany & Co.\u201cLVMH is driven by a permanent commitment to perfection and quality, and by a long-term vision combined with a sense of responsibility in all our corporate actions, notably in its commitment for the preservation of the environment, sustainability and inclusion. In a buoyant environment that remains uncertain in 2020, we continue to be vigilant and focused on our objectives for progress. We can count on the strength of our brands and the agility of our teams to reinforce, once again in 2020, our leadership in the universe of high-quality products.\u201dPERFORMANCE BY DIVISIONWines & Spirits \u2013 \u201cExcellent global momentum\u201dThe Wines & Spirits business group achieved organic revenue growth of +6%. Profit from recurring operations also increased by +6%. The business group continued to pursue its value strategy based on a strong innovation policy, while accentuating its environmental and societal commitment.The different regions contributed in a balanced way to its growth.

The American market saw a normalisation in stock levels among distributors at the end of the year, while China continued its rapid progress linked notably to the timing of Chinese New Year. The acquisitions in 2019 of Ch\u00e2teau du Galoupet and Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019Esclans mark LVMH\u2019s entry into the \u201cpromising\u201d market of high-quality ros\u00e9 wines.Fashion & Leather Goods: \u201cremarkable\u201d performances by Louis Vuitton and Christian DiorThe Fashion & Leather Goods business group achieved organic revenue growth of +17% in 2019.

Confirmation of the Maison\u2019s unique influence was its exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London which had record attendance of nearly 600,000 visitors. A new boutique on the Champs Elys\u00e9es in Paris took over from the historic address of 30 Avenue Montaigne while it is being renovated.

Loro Piana, Rimowa and Berluti experienced good progress.Perfumes and Cosmetics: \u201cExcellent growth of flagship brands and rapid progress in Asia\u201dThe Perfumes and Cosmetics business group achieved organic revenue growth of +9%, driven by the \u201cremarkable momentum\u201d of its major brands, notably Dior, Guerlain and Givenchy.Profit from recurring operations was up +1% after taking into account an exceptional depreciation of the product lines of certain young American brands. Skincare grew, underpinned notably by the demand in Asia. Christian Dior continued to grow much faster than the market. In addition to the strength of its iconic perfumes J\u2019adore, Miss Dior and Sauvage, makeup and skincare contributed significantly to the excellent performance of the Maison.Guerlain\u2019s growth accelerated and the brand enjoyed particularly good momentum with the success of Abeille Royale in skincare and Rouge G in makeup.

High jewelry lines Serpenti, B.Zero 1 and Diva\u2019s Dream were enriched with many new products and the Fiorever collection, launched at the end of 2018, combining flowers and diamonds, contributed significantly to growth.In watchmaking, the Serpenti Seduttori watch was exceptionally well received, LVMH said. Chaumet\u2019s growth was driven by the success of its iconic collections. In early 2020, the Maison will inaugurate its completed renovated site on Place Vend\u00f4me. As distribution evolves rapidly within the watchmaking sector, TAG Heuer continued to work with its partners to provide an increasingly selective and efficient distribution network, while pursuing its creative resurgence.Hublot recorded strong growth, driven by the Classic Fusion, Big Bang and Spirit of Big Bang lines.

The 24S digital platform progressed well, with an increasingly international clientele.In the second half of 2019, DFS faced a slowdown in tourism in Hong Kong, an important market. In Europe, the Galleria in Venice continued to perform very well, and preparations are underway for the imminent opening of its new location at La Samaritaine in Paris.Outlook: \u201cCautiously confident\u201d for 2020In an uncertain geopolitical context, LVMH said that it is well-equipped to continue its growth momentum across all business groups in 2020. The Group will pursue its strategy focused on developing its brands by continuing to build on strong innovation and investments as well as a constant quest for quality in their products and their distribution.\u201cDriven by the agility of its teams, their entrepreneurial spirit, the balance between its different businesses and geographic diversity, LVMH enters 2020 with cautious confidence and once again, sets an objective of reinforcing its global leadership position in luxury goods,\u201d the group concluded.Dividend up by 13%At the Annual General Meeting on 16 April, LVMH will propose a dividend of \u20ac6.80 per share, an increase of 13%.

            "description": "Glenmorangie has released three global travel retail-exclusive whiskies that celebrate the art of distilling.Glenmorangie Accord, Elementa and Tribute were first released through Dubai Duty Free at Dubai International Airport (DXB) in October and CDF-Lagard\u00e8re in November. They will be introduced into airports globally in early 2020.The range was created by Glenmorangie Director of Distilling, Whisky Creation & Whisky Stocks Dr Bill Lumsden, who aimed to pay homage to the distillery\u2019s history. \u201cAt Glenmorangie, we\u2019ve been honing our craft for more than 175 years, on our quest to create the most delicious whiskies. I hope travellers enjoy the tastes of these single malts, which shine a light on our expertise in cask marrying and wood finishing, as well as our heritage style of spirit,\u201d he said.At DXB and Hong Kong International Airport, the release was accompanied by activation spaces revealing the new identity of the whisky brand. Bright colours, greenery and an unexpected giraffe (a reference to the eight-metre high copper stills at Glenmorangie Distillery) welcome passengers to the space. Travellers then have the chance to go over tasting notes and try the trio of new whiskies.Dubai Duty Free Executive Vice Chairman & CEO Colm McLoughlin said: \u201cWe are delighted that Glenmorangie chose Dubai as one of the exclusive platforms for the three new expressions, providing our passengers with this opportunity. The displays are very prominent and eye-catching, the sales are doing very well. We are always pleased when partners such as Glenmorangie introduce new products and new initiatives with us, and we look forward to working with them on future launches.\u201dTasting notesGlenmorangie Accord: A fruity and rich 12-year-old whisky marrying bourbon and oloroso sherry casks. \u201cWith this whisky, I was inspired to explore the classic art of marrying casks. Selecting a smooth, fruity Glenmorangie aged in bourbon barrels, I carefully balanced it with a sweet, spicy whisky matured in oloroso sherry butts. Named to reflect its perfect harmony of casks, The Accord brims with rich fruit notes and our whisky\u2019s signature finesse,\u201d Lumsden said.Glenmorangie Elementa: A spicy and deep 14-year-old whisky finished in new charred oak casks. \u201cGlenmorangie was among the pioneers of wood finishing more than 30 years ago. Our Elementa celebrates this art, revealing the depths of flavour a skilful finish can bring. Taking whisky aged in bourbon casks, I finished it in new charred oak casks for woody depth and warm spice. As its name suggests, this whisky\u2019s taste deliciously reflects the natural influences of the new wood,\u201d Lumsden commented.Glenmorangie Tribute: A zesty and rounded 16-year-old whisky created from a heritage spirit batch. \u201cThere was a time when peat was the main source of fuel at Glenmorangie, giving our spirit a noticeably smoky style. To celebrate our heritage, I distilled a rare, lightly peated spirit with a hint of smoke. Aged in bourbon casks and united with Glenmorangie\u2019s signature spirit, our Tribute\u2019s citrus smoothness and rounded flavours are a zesty nod to the past,\u201d Lumsden said.",

Ltd. to a provincial government-backed investment vehicle, according to a Kweichow Moutai filing. The transfer of about 57 billion yuan ($8.1 billion) of the Shanghai-listed distiller\u2019s equity is intended to address market concerns about Guizhou\u2019s debt risks.The 50.24 million shares in the transaction represent nearly 4% of Kweichow Moutai\u2019s equity. The Guizhou-based distiller traded at 1,135.1 yuan a share at Thursday\u2019s close, making it the most valuable mainland listing with a market capitalization of 1.43 trillion yuan. By comparison, Guizhou, with a population of 36 million people, had a 2018 gross domestic product (GDP) of 1.48 trillion yuan.The Kweichow Moutai transaction may show how local Chinese governments could leverage their state-owned assets to address debt problems, one bond manager suggested. The manager said he expected other local authorities to follow Guizhou by adopting similar approaches.Kweichow Moutai produces the strong alcoholic spirit known as China\u2019s national liquor that is often served on official occasions and at state banquets. After the transaction, Moutai Group, wholly owned by the Guizhou state-owned asset regulator, will hold 58% of Kweichow Moutai.The deal comes amid rising market concerns over Guizhou\u2019s financial condition as the province faces mounting debt repayment pressures.At the end of 2018, the Guizhou provincial government had repayment obligations on nearly 885 billion yuan of outstanding debt, or 59.7% of the province\u2019s GDP, according to Everbright Securities. The province is among a number of localities that have experienced rising corporate bond defaults this year.In October, Guizhou Vice Governor Tan Jiong met with bond investors at the Shanghai Stock Exchange in hopes of restoring investor confidence and pledged supportive policies to ensure repayment.Analysts at Tianfeng Securities said after the meeting that the market was still holding back despite official backing and was awaiting concrete measures that could provide new funding to improve the province\u2019s capital condition.The stake transfer from Moutai Group will help ease the market concerns, Pacific Securities said Friday in a research note. The Guizhou government\u2019s total holdings in Kweichow Moutai are worth more than 900 billion yuan, which could be used to back government debt and bonds issued by government financing vehicles, Pacific Securities said.Nonetheless, several bond investors said that while the stake transfer would bolster market confidence, it will take time to assess how it will affect trading of bonds linked to Guizhou.\u201cThe impact of the stake transfer hasn\u2019t shown on the secondary market,\u201d one bond trader said.Another bond market analyst said the transfer is more a symbolic move to show the provincial government\u2019s capacity.\u201cRather than using the Kweichow Moutai stake as collateral for fundraising, it is more likely (for the government) to use Guizhou State-Owned Capital Management as a main funding platform in the future,\u201d the analyst said.Contact reporter Han Wei (weihan@caixin.com)Caixin Global has officially launched Caixin CEIC Mobile, a mobile-only version of a world-class platform for macroeconomic and microeconomic data.From now on, all users can enjoy a one-month free trial on the Caixin App through December 2019.

            "description": "HONG KONG \u2014 Vintage Chinese teas are making a mark for themselves in Hong Kong\u2019s auction scene, with investors and collectors paying record prices, defying the gloom in a city hamstrung by months of political upheaval and a recession.A stack of seven compressed cakes of Tong Xing Hao Puer tea from the 1920s went under the hammer for HK$8.4 million (S$1.46 million) before fees on Nov 24, according to auctioneer Hong Kong L&H Auction.Local and mainland Chinese bidders drove the price to the upper end of its estimate of between HK$5.8 million and HK$8.5 million, according to Mr Zhou Zi, founder and chief executive of the Causeway Bay auction house.That works out to be a cool 14.4 per cent compound annual growth from Mr Zhou\u2019s estimate of HK$10,000 for its value in 1970. The appreciation is respectable compared with a 10 to 13 per cent annualised gain in Hong Kong and US benchmark stock indices over that time, or a 3.2 per cent gain from a basket of 23 commodities tracked by Bloomberg.\u201cVintage Puer can be an investment vehicle because the value will keep appreciating,\u201d Mr Zhou said in an interview. \u201cIt cannot be copied, it is a consumable product with depleting supply over time and it tastes better as it ages. These factors will keep the market on the up trend.\u201dThe surge in prices for vintage teas has followed a recent phenomenon in modern-day collectibles and local memorabilia, with investors snapping up items like Kweichow Moutai liquor and limited-edition sneakers, as potentially the next big hits.A series of Old Master Q comic that has defined Hong Kong\u2019s social culture for generations, sold for five times its estimate at a Sotheby\u2019s auction last year. The first-ever series of stamps featuring the nostalgic comic characters issued by Hongkong Post earlier this month also sold out instantly.At the Nov 24 autumn auction, several other lots of Puer teas also fetched the upper end or went above their valuations, L&H\u2019s Mr Zhou said. They included the red-marked Puer from the 1940s and 1950s, and the Baba Qing Puer produced in the 1980s and 1990s.\u201cA lot of people have money but cannot find the things they want because they did not have the means or channels to source for them,\u201d Mr Zhou said. \u201cIn such a situation, the price will go up and set a new high over time.\u201dDrinking Puer on a regular basis is said to help lower blood sugar and cholesterol, reduce obesity and boost immunity.A pastime for some ethnic minorities in China, it was not popular until it caught the attention of the imperial families in the later years of the Qing dynasty.Mr Shan Dabao, who has been involved in tea retailing for 12 years in Beijing, said prices for vintage Puer have reached irrational levels because demand for them is not sustainable.\u201cSome auction houses buy and sell their own teas, driving up prices and raising their profiles,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is the usual way to give vintage teas a sense of presence.\u201dMr Shan may have a point because it was not long ago that the market for vintage teas went through its boom and bust cycle in China.In 2017, a variety known as the King of Puer fell to 200,000 yuan (S$38,656) per kg from 6 million yuan, according to a Phoenix News report.The famous Dayi horse zodiac tea cakes slumped 50 per cent in October 2014 from 20,600 yuan earlier in that year, Xinhua News reported.Mr Zhou of L&H Auction said that may have been true at that time. The market profile has since changed, he added.\u201cOne of the characteristics of those buyers is that they were retail investors and their financial strength was insufficient,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, investors in vintage teas are in a more solid financial position, and auction houses are able to make the market more efficient and transparent.\u201dTo avoid falling into a speculative trap, investors should pick authentic, high-quality products and brands with liquidity, reputation and limited editions, he said. Trading at trusted and sizeable auction venues is also advisable, he added.\u201cWe can\u2019t control the views of vintage tea buyers or critics,\u201d Mr Zhou said. \u201cWe just put them on the market in an open and transparent way, and let the market determine their prices.\u201d SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST",

In addition, sales continued in major overseas markets such as the United States, Russia, Germany, Italy and Australia.Next year, Kweichow Moutai would further expand its overseas footprint, especially in the countries and regions involved in the Belt and Road Initiative, the company said. A promotional push is likely in Dubai. To brighten its brand image, it also plans sponsorship of corporate events at home and overseas, like the China Daily-hosted Vision China series of public talks and discussions.Moutai products, which have often been in tight supply because of strong demand, have sparked speculative transactions in the China market. On some e-commerce platforms, buyers had to reserve products in advance and complete purchases as soon as the products became available, to avoid a potential out-of-stock situation.The Shanghai-listed company's market capitalization exceeded 1.4 trillion yuan this year. In June, it became the first stock to see its share price exceed 1,000 yuan after 27 years. It also became the most expensive stock in the A-share market, boosted by continuously growing consumer demand for the company's products and good corporate earnings.\"Baijiu embodies Chinese culture in a sense. It boasts distinguished core competitiveness. Foreign companies are hard to compete with Chinese liquor makers in this regard,\" said Zi Meng, managing director of Guotai Junan Securities.\"The net profit margin of high-end baijiu makers can exceed 40 percent, higher than the 35-percent gross profit margin of most consumer products. In the future, baijiu distillers may grow further using their strong brand image, popular products and efficient sales channels.\"Meanwhile, a number of major middle-end and high-end baijiu distillers in China have raised their product prices. Earlier this year, higher-end spirit makers such as Sichuan-based Wuliangye Yibin Co Ltd and Luzhou Laojiao Group raised their prices.In early November, baijiu maker Sichuan-based Shuijingfang Liquor Industry Co Ltd announced it would raise the prices of four of its higher-end products. The price of one variety of 500-ml baijiu bottle rose 60 yuan to 1,039 yuan. For three other varieties, prices rose 20 yuan per bottle, according to the company.\"With the hot sales season of Spring Festival fast approaching, many people will buy baijiu for family and business banquets. So, some white spirit makers aim to burnish their brand image by raising prices,\" said Cai Xuefei, a white spirit industry analyst.Zi of Guotai Junan Securities said there is a growing trend of people investing in high-end liquors to compile vast personal collections. Liquor bottles as collectibles has become a fad. High-income consumers are not price-sensitive, leading to a continuous rise in prices of high-end baijiu products.On the other hand, sales of wines, a newcomer in the array of alcoholic drinks in China, have been surging in the past few years, prompted by a growing demand from young consumers who would like to pursue healthy and trendy lifestyles.China has eight major wine producing areas, including Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, Ningxia Hui autonomous region and Gansu province. Red grape varieties make up about 80 percent of the total wine market in China, and white wines take the rest.In the past two years, both the number of online wine buyers and sales grew at an annual rate of 40 percent. Supermarkets and liquor stores still remain the major distribution channels for wines, according to data from consultancy Frost& Sullivan.Wine consumers aged between 18 and 35 accounted for more than 80 percent of the total, and the proportion of youngsters joining the wine consumption group has been rising, it found.In the past five years, wine sales in China grew from 66.5 billion yuan to 90.22 billion yuan, at a compound annual growth rate of 7.9 percent, buoyed by the increasing recognition of wines by Chinese consumers. In the next five years, with the wine-drinking culture expected to become even more popular, sales will continue to grow steadily, said Frost& Sullivan.\"Last year, the global average consumption ratio of spirits and wines was equal, while in China, the proportion was about 7:1. The annual consumption volume of wines per capita in China is less than 1.5 liters, while the corresponding number in the United States has exceeded 10 liters,\" said Neil Wang, president of Frost & Sullivan's China unit.To tap the significant growth potential, especially among young consumers, more and more domestic wine producers are focusing on adjusting their product structures. They have introduced more wine varieties in smaller (200 ml or 375 ml) bottles.\"Besides, with demand for high-quality and differentiated products growing, the advantages of local and distinctive small-scale production areas have become more prominent. Wines made from small-scale and niche production areas are gradually recognized and favored by an increasing number of Chinese consumers,\" Wang said.",

            "description": "Even as global consumer brands grow more dependent on Asia for sales of everything from fancy handbags to baby formula, European retailers keep retreating from the world\u2019s fastest-growing markets.The U.K.\u2019s Tesco Plc, which said this month that it\u2019s weighing a sale of its Thailand and Malaysia operations, is just the latest. Earlier this year, Germany\u2019s Metro AG and France\u2019s Carrefour SA offloaded their big-box stores in China. Britain\u2019s Marks & Spencer Group Plc beat them to the exit by completing a regional pullback last year.The retrenchment, which reverses a two-decade expansion, contrasts with continuing growth for European luxury companies including LVMH and Kering SA, which have ridden a wave of demand for Louis Vuitton bags and Gucci fashions in China. While producers of mainstream goods such as baby formula makers Danone and Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc have reported hiccups in China, they\u2019re also increasingly reliant on Asia.European grocers and big-box store chains have decided they can do without the hassle of operating in a Chinese market where consumer spending is easing amid a trade war with the U.S. For many of them, more immediate challenges loom closer to home, ranging from Brexit to protests and strikes in France.\u201cThe companies that have a luxury or premium position are doing much better in Asia\u201d than those that sell everyday items, said Ray Gaul, senior vice president of Retail Insights at research firm Kantar. \u201cEveryday supermarket operators have struggled.\u201dLocal rivalsWhile western big-box retailers have mostly avoided political pitfalls that have ensnared some luxury brands and the National Basketball Association, they\u2019ve struggled to differentiate themselves in a market where local rivals such as Yonghui Superstores Co. are expanding.Tesco, the largest British retailer, folded its China business into a joint venture in 2013 and exited South Korea two years later. The company could use proceeds from a sale of its Malaysia and Thailand operations, which analysts have estimated could fetch more than $9 billion, to restructure its U.K. business, which has cut thousands of jobs and shifted to new formats including checkout-free stores amid tough competition from discounters and Brexit-related pricing pressure.Many European chains \u201chave had to redirect investment to protect their core operations,\u201d said Nick Miles, head of Asia Research at the Institute of Grocery Distribution.Starting in the 1990s, Carrefour opened more than 200 so-called hypermarkets selling everything from food to hardware in China before reversing course. In June, it sold 80% of its Chinese operations to local rival Suning.com Co., marking the latest Asian exit for the company after India, Japan and South Korea. Carrefour five years ago pulled out of India, a market where burdensome regulations have kept many foreign retailers at bay.Metro agreed in November to offload its China business to Wumei Technology Group Inc. Its Japan, India and Pakistan units have been cited as potential divestments by analysts.M&S closingsMarks & Spencer sold its Hong Kong retail operations last year after closing unprofitable outlets in mainland China and elsewhere, pointing to a fragmented store portfolio and lack of scale.The rapid advance of online shopping has challenged European retailers in a market where some regional rivals have moved more decisively. China\u2019s largest hypermarket chain, Sun Art Retail Group Ltd., two years ago sold a 36% stake to internet giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. for $2.9 billion, boosting its digital capabilities.A few western retailers are bucking the trend and expanding in Asia \u2013 often with the help of local players with critical market expertise. France\u2019s Auchan Retail SA, for example, boosted its stake in Sun Art as Alibaba invested in the Hong Kong-listed retailer.In November, Walmart Inc. unveiled plans to open about 500 stores and depots over five to seven years in China. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company has a partnership with local online retailer JD.com Inc.Discount baijiuWalmart\u2019s membership-based Sam\u2019s Club has thrived in China by going upscale and offering foreign goods to increasingly affluent shoppers. Rival Costco Wholesale Corp. in August drew crowds for the opening of its first outlet in the country, in Shanghai, offering Kweichow Moutai Co.\u2019s fiery baijiu liquor at a discount.U.K. online supermarket Ocado Group Plc has also focused on partnerships for boosting its international presence, most recently announcing an alliance with Japanese retailer Aeon Co. to set up robotic warehouses for online grocery sales.Luke Jensen, CEO of Ocado\u2019s technology arm, said working with a partner like Aeon is invaluable because \u201cthey have a deep understanding of their customers, and we can configure our technology to meet the specific challenges and opportunities of the Japanese market.\u201d Rebecca Smith, Bloomberg",

El a\u00f1o pasado sus ventas aumentaron un 12 %, pero m\u00e1s, en un 16,4 % en t\u00e9rminos de volumen frente a otros licores. Y de esta situaci\u00f3n, quien ha salido m\u00e1s favorecido es Diageo, la multinacional del Reino Unido con sede en Londres cuyos principales propietarios son fondos de inversi\u00f3n a trav\u00e9s de las bolsas de valores de Londres y Nueva York.Resultado de la fusi\u00f3n en 1997 de Guinness PLC y alcohol y Grand Metropolitan plc (The Gale Group Inc, 2006), que inclu\u00eda alimentos y bebidas de marcas, Diageo tom\u00f3 a principios de siglo, la acertada decisi\u00f3n estrat\u00e9gica de salir de los intereses alimentarios de la compa\u00f1\u00eda para centrarse exclusivamente en el alcohol premium. Movida que lo coloc\u00f3 por muchos a\u00f1os como el mayor productor de licores del mundo, hasta hace dos a\u00f1os cuando fue superado por la empresa parcialmente estatal china, Kweichow Moutai. Sin embargo, continua como el mayor productor de whisky del mundo, con 29 destiler\u00edas a lo largo y ancho de Escocia...Publicidad..La marca emblem\u00e1tica es Johnnie Walker que se origin\u00f3 en la ciudad escocesa de Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire, por el tendero John Walker, aunque tambi\u00e9n comercializa otras marcas como J&B, Buchanan\u2019s, Bushmills y Crown Royal whisky. Old Parr de Buchanan\u00b4s es el whisky rey en ventas Colombia, pero la marca apenas se conoce fuera del mercado americano donde ha promovido principalmente a los bebedores hispanos, tanto en los EE. UU. como en Latinoam\u00e9rica. En Colombia Old Parr lleg\u00f3 a controlar el 52 % del mercado Scotch del pa\u00eds, con m\u00e1s de 2.5 millones de botellas por a\u00f1o, gracias a una excelente campa\u00f1a de publicidad, que posicion\u00f3 a la bebida casi como insignia en el festival vallenato, y a otorgarle a Valledupar el apodo de \"Valle de Cacique Old Parr\"....Publicidad.......Publicidad....Se comenta que el origen de este \u00e9xito en ventas se debe a la proximidad de Valledupar con la frontera venezolana, desde donde empez\u00f3 a cruzar ilegalmente en la d\u00e9cada de los 60s. Las campa\u00f1as publicitarias han recurrido a artistas colombianos, en 2012, al representante del vallenato Silvestre Dangond cuyo nombre se asoci\u00f3 con la marca en una botella especial, que se agot\u00f3 r\u00e1pidamente. Y desde hace tres a\u00f1os, al artista reggaetonero antioque\u00f1o J Balvin que ha logrado posicionarse tanto en el mercado hispanoparlante como anglosaj\u00f3n, qui\u00e9n en febrero de este a\u00f1o present\u00f3 un dise\u00f1o especial de su autor\u00eda para una edici\u00f3n limitada del empaque de Buchanan's DeLuxe Blended Scotch Whisky, que marca la primera colaboraci\u00f3n de producto en la historia de Buchanan\u00b4s.El mercado colombiano sigue siendo muy importante para Diageo, tanto que en 2014, abri\u00f3 una tienda independiente libre de impuestos en el aeropuerto de Bogot\u00e1 y ese mismo a\u00f1o, se lanz\u00f3 un exclusivo Old Parr Tribute, una mezcla de whisky escoc\u00e9s de bourbon y jerez, presentado en una jarra marr\u00f3n, exclusivamente para el mercado colombiano. \"Quer\u00edamos agradecer de alguna manera a los colombianos por ser los mayores consumidores de este whisky, por su amor por la marca\", explic\u00f3 Juan Sergio Valc\u00e1rcel, entonces director de marketing e innovaci\u00f3n de Diageo Colombia.Adem\u00e1s de whisky, Diageo cuenta con otras marcas de atractivos y mercados diferentes, como Guinness, una marca con fuertes ra\u00edces irlandesas, el vodka Smirnoff, Baileys y los tequilas Jos\u00e9 Cuervo y Don Julio, su \u00faltima adquisici\u00f3n. Tambi\u00e9n posee el 37% de la divisi\u00f3n Mo\u00ebt Hennessy de la compa\u00f1\u00eda francesa de art\u00edculos de lujo LVMH. Diageo vende sus productos en mas de 180 pa\u00edses y tiene oficinas en alrededor de 80 pa\u00edses. Y ahora su nuevo producto es el turismo de whisky escoc\u00e9s, con un programa de inversi\u00f3n de \u00a3 150 millones para renovar cuatro destiler\u00edas que representan \"las cuatro esquinas de Escocia\".El a\u00f1o pasado en Colombia, Diageo vendi\u00f3 $ 646.495 millones, con una utilidad de $ 48.9010 millones, y en entre julio de 2018 y el 30 de junio de 2019 creci\u00f3 un 19 % en ventas, jalonado por las marcas Old Parr-Buchanan\u00b4s, Johnnie Walker y Black & White. Algunos analistas justifican el repunte de ventas de whisky debido al aumento en los impuestos, que gener\u00f3 que los whiskys tuvieran un precio mucho m\u00e1s competitivo, no tan diferentes como en oras \u00e9pocas del ron o aguardiente. Sea el \u00e9xito de la estrategia publicitar\u00eda o precios m\u00e1s similares a la competencia, lo cierto es que Colombia es una parte muy importante de su mercado, al cual hace referencia con su publicidad y artistas.",

Ltd. has fallen from grace as an ongoing graft crackdown continues to rock the world\u2019s most valuable liquor company.Former Moutai deputy general manager and Communist Party committee member Du Guangyi has come under investigation for \u201cserious violations of (Communist Party) discipline and law,\u201d the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection\u2019s (CCDI) office in Southwest China\u2019s Guizhou province announced on Wednesday.The commission said in the announcement that Du had violated political discipline, resisted investigation by Communist Party authorities, used his position to gain benefits for others, and accepted extremely large bribes, for which he faces criminal charges. He has been expelled from the party; his illegal gains have been confiscated; and evidence of his alleged wrongdoing has been handed over to prosecutors, the watchdog said.The 64-year-old retired in January 2016. He is the ninth former senior Moutai executive to be taken down on corruption charges since May, when investigators took in former chairman Yuan Renguo in connection with a probe of Wang Xiaoguang, former Guizhou vice governor, and Wang Sanyun, former party chief of neighboring Gansu province.Under Yuan, Du Guangyi was responsible for sales and distribution of Feitian Moutai, the company\u2019s famous premium brand of \u201cbaijiu,\u201d the world\u2019s most popular liquor variety. Most of the other eight former executives also worked in sales and distribution. The CCDI has accused them of exchanging Moutai distribution licenses for money, sex and political patronage. Moutai has been forced to replace the majority of its senior executives and develop a new sales model this year, after the Yuan investigation revealed deeply rooted corruption in the company\u2019s existing distribution network.Moutai reported its slowest six-month sales growth in three years in July, as it pivoted to a direct-sales strategy to root out graft.Du began his career at the liquor group in 1999, working in senior positions and serving as a member of Kweichou Moutai\u2019s executive board and party committee. Du was chairman of the Moutai liquor sales subsidiary before he retired. According to Moutai financial reports, Du earned a salary of 1.38 million yuan in his last year at the company.Moutai\u2019s Shanghai-listed shares closed up 2.29% at 1,163 yuan per share on Friday. The company broke a record to become China\u2019s first stock with shares worth over 1,000 yuan on June 27.Contact reporter Isabelle Li (liyi@caixin.com)",

            "description": "The company set up its e-commerce unit in 2014 and its own online platform the following year, which allowed licensed distributors to sell its products directly to consumers.Chinese liquor giant Kweichow Moutai Co. Ltd. has announced it is shutting down its e-commerce unit, which had failed to solve the problem of distributors hoarding stock to drive up prices.Moutai\u2019s board voted unanimously to close the unit, the company said in a statement (link in Chinese) to the Shanghai Stock Exchange on Tuesday. No reason was given for the closure.The statement said the closure won\u2019t have a significant impact on the company\u2019s business or finances.The company\u2019s stock edged down 0.17% in Friday trading.The liquor company has suspended it self-run online sales channels since September, Caixin has learned, though its products were still available from third-party platforms as of the time of publishing.Known for producing the traditional and popular grain alcohol \u201cbaijiu,\u201d Moutai was the world\u2019s most valuable liquor company in 2017. The company set up its e-commerce unit in 2014 and its own online platform the following year, which allowed licensed distributors to sell its products directly to consumers.The company\u2019s online sales have since grown rapidly. Including third-party platforms such as JD.com, Moutai racked up 4.6 billion yuan ($657 million) in online sales in 2016, nearly one-tenth of its total sales that year.In 2017, Moutai told all of its distributors that they\u2019d have to sell at least 30% of the products they received through the company\u2019s own e-commerce platform, ensuring Moutai could track their sales. That was increased to 40% last year.Distributors were also told that deposits they paid to Moutai to secure deliveries could be confiscated should they not reach these targets, according to one distributer based in East China\u2019s Shandong province.Hoarding had long been a problem for the company, with distributors creating scarcity in the market to increase prices.But this aggressive move faced pushback from distributors. One based in Beijing told Caixin that many simply ignored the company\u2019s demands.Moutai has been facing internal challenges that may have made enforcing these rules harder. In March, former e-commerce unit head Nie Yong was detained on suspicion of having accepted bribes from government officials looking to get their hands on lucrative distribution licenses. Nie\u2019s downfall led to a planned expansion of the unit being shelved, the Beijing-based distributor said.Nie Yong is just one of nine former high-level Moutai executives that have been brought down since May in a corruption crackdown connected with the company. The latest case involved Du Guangyi, a former deputy general manager, who was put under official investigation earlier this month.Contact reporter Mo Yelin (yelinmo@caixin.com)",

You have continued market liberalisation.\u201dAsha Mehta(This story appears in the 06 December, 2019 issue of Forbes India. To visit our Archives, click here.)On March 1, 2018, Asha Mehta\u2019s firm, Boston\u2019s Acadian Asset Management, announced it would be launching a new China strategy, focussed on investing directly in mainland Chinese companies. Her timing could not have been worse. Three weeks later President Trump launched an all-out trade war, vowing to place tariffs on tens of billions of Chinese imports. It was the beginning of a nearly continuous stream of China-bashing from the White House, which\u2014no surprise\u2014has wreaked havoc on Chinese equities. In the 18 months since, MSCI\u2019s China Stock Index is down 16 percent, while the S&P 500 has gained 11 percent.\u201cChina has been a hard sell,\u201d says Mehta, 41, as she stares out over Boston Harbor from her Franklin Street office, \u201cbut you have to ignore the noise. China\u2019s local market is becoming a net capital importer. You have continued market liberalisation.\u201dThe novel quantitative China-focussed strategy Mehta is charged with leading has grown from $15 million under management, in April 2018, to more than $138 million today. Big investors are pouring money into Acadian for two reasons. First, despite the rhetoric, China\u2019s volatile equity market is finally opening up. Until recently, most foreigners could invest only in H-shares of select big companies, which were traded on the Hong Kong Exchange. Now non-Chinese investors can directly buy so-called A-shares. \u201cAll the major benchmarks began adding the A-shares to their emerging markets indices last year,\u201d Mehta says, \u201cso there will be a wall of money moving in.\u201dThe other reason has to do with Mehta\u2019s track record. The China-heavy smallcap emerging markets strategy she also leads, with $2.4 billion under management, has returned 10.9 percent on average per year since its inception in 2011, beating its benchmark by 8.6 percent points per year on average. Her new China A-shares strategy is down 5.1 percent amid the current turmoil, but that\u2019s only half as bad as her benchmark, which is off 10 percent.\u201cChina represents just 5 percent of global market cap and could rise to 20 percent,\u201d Mehta says. \u201cOur clients see this as a strategic opportunity to get ahead of the flow of capital coming to China.\u201dMehta and her co-manager, Bin Shi, use algorithms to screen some 3,500 stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen for 100 fundamental and technical parameters ranging from price-to-book value and earnings surprises to relative strength and \u201cabnormalities\u201d in corporate accounting.Their fund currently has 100 holdings, mostly large-and mid-caps. Included among them are red chips like Kweichow Moutai and Wuliangye Yibin, two giant state-owned liquor companies that make grain alcohol known as baijiu. Many seem recession-proof. Kweichow has gained over 90 percent this year. Yibin is up over 150 percent.Mehta\u2019s route to global money management was atypical. She was raised in Gainesville, Florida, by two research physicians, her father from India and her mother the daughter of German and Russian Jewish immigrants.When Mehta was in grade school, she would sometimes stay with her grandparents in the small desert town of Bhiwani, west of Delhi, where her family was transplanted after India and Pakistan were partitioned in 1947. Her grandparents\u2019 three-room house had intermittent electricity and no running water. Sewage ran through the streets.\u201cI lived among children begging in the streets, in homes with poor sanitation\u201d she says about her summer visits to India. \u201cI was fascinated by my sameness with them [the children], yet our differences were so big. This intellectual curiosity from childhood fuelled my career in emerging markets.\u201dFor college, Mehta headed to Stanford thinking she would pursue medicine, but in 1999 while in rural India on a Unicef-funded internship in public health, her funding fell through.\u201c[It] got me thinking that if you really want to support development there, it\u2019s not going to happen through medicine. It had to happen through financing,\u201d she says.After graduating from Stanford in 2000 with a degree in biology and anthropology, she became an analyst in Goldman Sachs. A few years later she got her MBA from Wharton, landing at Acadian in 2007 as an analyst.Acadian was founded in 1977 as a research firm by a Putnam Investments alum known for building the world\u2019s first international index-matching strategy for State Street before getting into money management in the 1980s. Today the PhD-heavy firm has $94 billion under management.The firm rejects the idea of a perfectly efficient, perfectly priced market, especially in China, where 80 percent of players are mom-and-pop investors who treat the stock market like it\u2019s a Macau casino. \u201cThe word for stock market in Mandarin is \u2018stir fry,\u2019\u201d Mehta says. \u201cThere is this notion that it\u2019s hot. It can move on things people read on WeChat.\u201d",

But the strangest part? Most consumers say they don\u2019t even like the taste of the fiery spirit.A market researcher from Shanghai told The Wall Street Journal that famous Moutai hooch tastes \u201cvery much like ethanol.\u201dSo, why do people suffer through the fiery taste?It is purely based on reputation.Moutai has long been seen as a luxury product favored by China\u2019s wealthiest and most powerful Communist party leaders. So, as China\u2019s wealth has increased, more and more people have begun drinking Moutai.In some cases, Chinese businesspeople will treat their clients to Moutai \u2014 only to wash their mouths out with water afterwards to rid themselves of the nasty aftertaste (of course, not everyone dislikes the booze).And Kweichow Moutai has leaned in to its new luxury reputationKweichow Moutai has kept supplies of its liquor limited to cement its air of exclusivity. The company tells retailers to sell the booze for $213 per half liter \u2014 but many sellers charge closer to $400.And as the spirit\u2019s value has soared, so has the prevalence of entrepreneurs \u2014 both legitimate and illegitimate \u2014 trying to profit from it\u2026Investors pour money into mutual funds focused on Kweichow Moutai. Speculators stockpile the liquor in the hopes of reselling it at a profit down the road. Scalpers line up to buy Moutai from Costco members and flip it. Counterfeiters brew up fake Moutai and try to sell it as the real thing.",

Also a market-cap-weighted fund, it costs 42 basis points and holds 45 stocks of U.S. homebuilders, which have been having a banner year as homebuilder confidence climbed to new highs. D.R. Horton and Lennar are its two biggest holdings at over 25% of the portfolio.Third up is the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF with a 45% gain. The 25-stock portfolio is market-cap weighted, costs 35 basis points and tracks the widely followed chipmaking stocks. Taiwan Semiconductor , Intel , Nvidia and Texas Instruments are its largest holdings as of Thursday.The Global X MSCI China Consumer Staples ETF has a 44% gain for 2019. A market-cap-weighted ETF focused on the Chinese consumer, it costs 65 basis points to own and holds 26 stocks including conglomerate China Resources and liquor producer Kweichow Moutai .\"When I think about what's going on in China, I also think about where we priced expectations for the Chinese economy,\" Tim Seymour, founder and chief investment officer at Seymour Asset Management, said Monday on CNBC's \"ETF Edge.\"Despite soft data and troubling predictions on China's growth prospects from top economic bodies such as the International Monetary Fund \u2014 which cited uncertainties around trade and \"other geopolitical forces\" as reasons for its muted forecast \u2014 there's a chance Chinese consumers aren't in as treacherous a position as it seems, Seymour said.\"I think there is a broader consumption trend going on in China,\" he said. \"People forget: Although we think it's this big industrial and commodity economy, consumption in China has moved from about 30% 10 years ago to about 40%, and it's moving higher. So, the Chinese consumer has been more resilient here, and they're not quite the U.S. consumer, but they're getting there.\"Mary Ann Bartels, head of ETF strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research, found one group particularly appealing heading into year-end.\"Even with all of the trade issues, semiconductors are in a secular bull market,\" she said in the same \"ETF Edge\" interview. There is a \"lot of volatility with them on the upside and the downside, but we think there's still a lot of return.\"That falls in line with Bartels' view that a U.S. recession is still far off if not out of the question.\"We don't see a recession. We've only put that at 30% [probability],\" the strategist said. \"We do see modest growth. And in a modest-growth environment with the valuations where they are, we think cyclicals are more attractive than the defensive space.\"Bartels' view runs counter to recent trends. Defensive ETFs tracking real estate investment trusts , utilities , retail and consumer staples have outperformed since the end of July, while energy , consumer discretionary , material and industrial names have lagged.\"We do like cyclicals here, especially if we're going to get a year-end rally, and we're starting to move into one of the most positively seasonal periods within the market,\" Bartels said. \"The market has been faced with a lot of challenges, really hasn't been going down, and ... the defensive [sectors] have led. But \u2026 we find better valuations sitting in the cyclicals, and we still like semiconductors, and we like also the SMH to play semis.\"Seymour, who appears as a regular trader on CNBC's \"Fast Money,\" said he also liked the SMH, but more as a gauge for where the market's headed next versus the ETFs he'd recommend buying.\"If ETFs are telling a story, I'd first look at the SMH, which is the semiconductors, and then I would look at the more either late-cycle ETFs or exposure to the underlying [stocks] and say that this isn't just about a defensive rally,\" Seymour said.Instead, it could be a sign of a broader rotation into areas of the market that have fallen behind, he suggested.\"What's fascinating about where we are right now [is] the breakout of banks ,\" Seymour said. \"If you look at financials , they're kind of getting back above that long-term moving average, which gives you some sense of some confidence in the move, although we've been here before. Emerging markets, the [iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF , or] EEM, has been sideways, basically, for nine to 12 months, but looks like it's starting to break out. And then the other cyclical parts of the world. So, look at the [Global X DAX Germany ETF , or] DAX and look at the [iShares MSCI Germany ETF , or] EWG, which is a way to play that.\"Disclaimer",

Aujourd\u2019hui la plus grande Maison de Cognac ind\u00e9pendante Camus cultive une passion pour les cognacs d\u2019exception, utilisant un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 brevet\u00e9 de distillation sur-mesure. Les \u00ab t\u00eates \u00bb sont extraites et d\u00e9gust\u00e9es litre par litre, afin de s\u00e9lectionner celles qui sont les plus fortement concentr\u00e9es en ar\u00f4mes, et de les r\u00e9int\u00e9grer au c\u0153ur du distillat pour produire des eaux-de-vie intens\u00e9ment aromatiques. Cette m\u00e9thode, propre \u00e0 la Maison, permet de cr\u00e9er des cognacs riches en saveurs et fait de Camus la marque la plus r\u00e9compens\u00e9e par les jurys internationaux.Grande vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de marques de vins et spiritueuxSous la direction de Cyril Camus, la Maison Camus emploie d\u00e9sormais plus de 300 personnes r\u00e9parties dans huit pays et trois continents et poss\u00e8de des filiales en Chine et aux \u00c9tats-Unis, ainsi que des \u00e9quipes locales en Russie, en Chine, aux Etats-Unis, aux Emirats Arabes Unis et \u00e0 Hong-Kong.Aujourd\u2019hui, Camus Wines & Spirits est un distributeur international ind\u00e9pendant proposant une grande vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de marques de vins et spiritueux, telles que le baijiu chinois Kweichow Moutai sur le march\u00e9 duty free international et les vins Ch\u00e2teau Loudenne et Lambay Irish Whiskey, entres autres. En 2017, Camus a re\u00e7u le label Entreprise du Patrimoine Vivant qui r\u00e9compense les entreprises fran\u00e7aises au savoir-faire artisanal et industriel d\u2019excellence.Soir\u00e9e Loudenne au Tax FreeLors du TFWA-WE 2019, le Ch\u00e2teau Loudenne a offert une soir\u00e9e aux delegates du Tax Free sur le toit de l\u2019H\u00f4tel Radisson Blue. Le Ch\u00e2teau Loudenne est une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Saint-Yzans qui a travers\u00e9 l\u2019histoire du M\u00e9doc et qui est d\u00e9sormais d\u00e9tenue par le groupe de spiritueux chinois Kweichow et la maison Camus Wines & Spirits. Situ\u00e9 \u00e0 6 kilom\u00e8tres de Saint-Est\u00e8phe, Loudenne est un terroir de 132 ha dont 62 de vignes o\u00f9 merlot, cabernet-sauvignon, sauvignon blanc, s\u00e9millon s\u2019\u00e9panouissent \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 imm\u00e9diate des rives de la Gironde. Les vins commercialis\u00e9 par Camus, se d\u00e9clinent en rouge et blanc et deux cuv\u00e9es embl\u00e9matiques: Le Ch\u00e2teau et Les Folies.Des vins r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement r\u00e9compens\u00e9sLe Ch\u00e2teau Loudenne M\u00e9doc, Cru Bourgeois, est r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement r\u00e9compens\u00e9 pour sa qualit\u00e9 et son caract\u00e8re, sans oublier le second vin, Les Rives de Loudenne. Ch\u00e2teau Loudenne Bordeaux Blanc sec, est un vin exceptionnel en M\u00e9doc depuis 1880. Pink de Loudenne, Bordeaux Ros\u00e9, doit son nom \u00e0 la roseraie, le jardin et la couleur de ce c\u00e9l\u00e8bre Pink Ch\u00e2teau. Les vignes sont cultiv\u00e9es en bio dans un domaine certifi\u00e9 en Haute Valeur Environnementale pour un meilleur respect de la nature, avec des vendanges vertes et un effeuillage pour offrir le plus de soleil possible aux baies. A Loudenne, les visites du domaine et les d\u00e9gustations de vins sont gratuites pour les particuliers, sans r\u00e9servation d\u2019Avril \u00e0 Octobre, afin de garder le domaine dans le patrimoine de c\u0153ur des Maconnais.Une chartreuse du 17\u00e8me si\u00e8cleLoudenne, c\u2019est d\u2019abord une magnifique chartreuse du 17\u00e8me si\u00e8cle en bordure de Gironde, appel\u00e9e le Ch\u00e2teau Rose pour la couleur de ses pierres et sa roseraie. Loudenne est aussi un must de beaut\u00e9 gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 sa situation exceptionnelle et sa vue f\u00e9erique sur l\u2019estuaire m\u00e9docaine. Au c\u0153ur du M\u00e9doc et en bordure de l\u2019Estuaire de la Gironde lui conf\u00e8re sa r\u00e9putation Cette chartreuse du XVII\u00e8me si\u00e8cle est une des rares propri\u00e9t\u00e9s viticoles \u00e0 poss\u00e9der son port priv\u00e9 et de compter dans son jardin une collection de roses. Et \u00e0 peine d\u00e9barqu\u00e9 sur ce terroir de 132 hectares, v\u00e9ritable terre d\u2019excellence, on ne peut que se laisser emporter par la beaut\u00e9 et la magie des lieux.Coropri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Kweichow et de CamusC\u2019est aussi une belle histoire longue de 300 ans. Ce pass\u00e9 prestigieux le Ch\u00e2teau Loudenne le doit beaucoup \u00e0 deux n\u00e9gociants en vin britanniques : Alfred et Walter Gilbey, En 1875, deux amoureux de la vie et des belles choses. Ensemble, ils d\u00e9cident de faire de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 leur port d\u2019attache. Pendant 125 ans la famille Gilbey va b\u00e2tir la renomm\u00e9e du vignoble et faire de Loudenne un lieu de vie et de r\u00e9ception incontournable.On dit que l\u2019histoire est un \u00e9ternel recommencement\u2026 D\u00e9sormais copropri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Kweichow, premier groupe de spiritueux en Chine et de Camus, plus grande maison familiale ind\u00e9pendante de Cognac, Loudenne a renou\u00e9 avec sa gloire pass\u00e9e et retrouve aujourd\u2019hui le faste qui \u00e9tait le sien hier.

            "description": "Budweiser beer products manufactured by Anheuser-Busch InBev NV sit on display during a news conference in Hong Kong, China, on Thursday, July 4, 2019. Kyle Lam | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe world's largest brewer is making a big push for China and other parts of Asia \u2014 but it could prove challenging for Anheuser-Busch InBev to topple local beers that have long dominated their home markets. After listing its Budweiser APAC in Hong Kong last week, AB InBev said it will be looking to expand in Asia, especially in China, South Korea, India and Vietnam. But in China \u2014 where premium beers are popular \u2014 AB InBev is in third position with a 16% market share, according to Euromonitor. Across Southeast Asia, the company is not even in the top ten places. \"Local Chinese beer companies have very strong control on the local regional share market so it remains to be seen what Budweiser's strategy (is) going forward from here,\" Bank of Communications International's chief strategist, Hao Hong told CNBC. Analysts say big players have already been buying up smaller beer companies in Asia, and that could be one of the strategies for AB InBev. However, local beers still dominate in Asia.China's brewsChina is the world's largest beer market by sales but firms have found it challenging amid fierce competition between local brewers and global beer giants. China Resources Beer has more than 25% market share in the Chinese market, according to Reuters. Its vastly popular Snow beer is the top-selling beer in the world by volume. The company is the largest local brewer by market value, followed by Tsingtao Brewery and Chongqing Brewery, Refinitiv data shows. While the local Chinese brewers have a strong presence in the regional share market, the beer market in China is still largely fragmented, Hong said. He added that China's tipple of choice is still the baijiu, a traditional drink made from fermented grain that holds sway in the country. \"The segment that is really doing well is the baijiu ... so it remains to be seen how much further growth the company can get from the Chinese market,\" he said, referring to Budweiser APAC. About half of all beer consumed across the globe are sold by AB InBev, Heineken, Carlsberg and China's Snow. In addition to Budweiser, AB InBev also owns other popular beers such as Stella Artois, Corona and Hoegaarden.Southeast Asia beer dealsSoutheast Asia could prove to have better prospects, as it is projected to be a key driver for growth, according to research analyst at Euromonitor, Jarred Neubronner. Key markets would be Vietnam and Philippines, he added. \"(AB InBev) is still not among the top 10 players in the Southeast Asian region in 2018 due to the dominance of local beer players,\" he said. \"In order to grow further, the company needs to make a breakthrough in Southeast Asia countries such as Vietnam and Philippines.\" Some players have already done so by acquiring domestic brands in some of those markets.Employees arrange bottles of Moutai baijiu at the Kweichow Moutai factory in the town of Maotai in Renhuai, Guizhou province, China, Dec. 14, 2017. Qilai Shen | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThai Beverage, for instance, bought over Vietnam's largest beer company Sabeco (Saigon Beer Alcohol Beverage Corp) in a $4.8 billion deal in 2017. \"(That) immediately catapulted Thai Beverage to become the number one beer player by volume in Southeast Asia,\" said Neubronner. Across Asia-Pacific, the company, which is listed in Singapore, ranked sixth in 2018 in terms of market share at 3.9%, according to Euromonitor. \"Many leading beer players in Southeast Asia are local players with strong local knowledge and distribution networks, so acquisitions of local beer companies is possible if AB InBev wishes to increase its market share in the region and tap on the expertise from established local players,\" Neubronner said. In China, Heineken took a 40% stake in China Resources Beer last year, in a challenge to AB InBev place in the premium lager market there. However, beer might be losing ground to spirits, wine and other alcoholic beverages. Beer consumption in China is set to drop almost one billion liters by 2023, as consumers switch to other alcoholic beverages such as spirits, according to Euromonitor.Cheers to alcohol stocksDemand for alcohol-related stocks in Asia has been strong, according to KraneShares Chief Investment Officer Brendan Ahern, whose firm operates 16 China-focused ETFs with $2.5 billion assets under management. Commenting on the Budweiser IPO, he said: \"Alcohol stocks have been a favored sector for Asia investors of late, which the company is tapping into.\"watch now",

Das Lokal f\u00fchrt ein Schweizer.Von Dominik Buholzer, freier AutorRund 30 Quadratkilometer gross ist Macau und z\u00e4hlt gut 600\u2018000 Einwohner. Doch ansonsten ist in der ehemaligen portugiesischen Kolonie, die 1999 an China zur\u00fcckging, nichts beschaulich. Die Stadt wird auch als \u00abLas Vegas Asiens\u00bb bezeichnet, doch inzwischen hinkt dieser Vergleich.Zwar z\u00e4hlt Macau weniger Casinos (41) als die amerikanische Stadt (104). Doch in Sachen Umsatz bewegt sich die chinesische Sonderverwaltungszone l\u00e4ngst in eigenen Sph\u00e4ren. Umgerechnet 18 Milliarden (US-)Dollar betrugen die Einnahmen aus dem Gl\u00fccksspiel im ersten Halbjahr 2019. In Las Vegas waren es gerade mal 5 Milliarden Dollar.Die Weinkarte wiegt sieben KilogrammSeinen Reichtum verdankt Macau den mehr als 30 Millionen spielverr\u00fcckten Chinesen, die j\u00e4hrlich in die Stadt am Perlfluss-Delta str\u00f6men. Macau profitiert dabei von seiner Sonderstellung. Es ist der einzige Ort in China, wo Gl\u00fccksspiele das ganze Jahr \u00fcber geduldet werden.Macau hat sich aber nicht nur dem Gl\u00fccksspiel verschrieben, sondern auch der Spitzenk\u00fcche. Ganz voran das Grand Lisboa \u2013 ein Luxustempel, den der Schweizer Hotelier Jonas Sch\u00fcrmann (Bild oben) f\u00fchrt. Der Komplex vereint in seinen Restaurants insgesamt sieben Michelin-Sterne. Zweimal die h\u00f6chste Auszeichnung von drei Sternen holten sich zuletzt das \u00abThe 8\u00bb und das \u00abRobuchon au D\u00f4me\u00bb. Beim \u00abThe 8\u00bb ist alleine schon die Weinkarte ein Besuch wert: Sie wiegt sieben Kilogramm und umfasst 17\u2018000 Weine (Bild unten).Branntwein mit KultstatusDarunter befindet sich auch eine kleine Anzahl an 80-j\u00e4hrigem Kweichow Moutai \u2013 einer wahren Rarit\u00e4t. Der Branntwein geniesst bei Chinesen Kultstatus und hat seinen Preis. F\u00fcr eine Flasche des 80-J\u00e4hrigen legt man umgerechnet 100\u2018000 Franken hin. Da g\u00f6nnt sich schon mal der eine oder andere Gast im Spielerparadies. \u00abErst vor kurzem haben wir eine Flasche davon verkauft\u00bb, sagt Sch\u00fcrmann.Trotz des immensen Flaschenguts dauert es in der Regel nicht l\u00e4nger als in jedem anderen Restaurant, bis der gew\u00fcnschte edle Tropfen auf dem Tisch steht, versichert Sch\u00fcrmann: \u00abIm schlimmsten Fall muss ein Gast 15 Minuten warten.\u00bbPrestigeobjekt mit mehreren HotelsDie Weinsammlung wuchs \u00aborganisch\u00bb, wie Sch\u00fcrmann weiter erz\u00e4hlt. Heute erstreckt sie sich \u00fcber 23 R\u00e4ume, in einem davon befand sich mal die W\u00e4scherei. Sie wurde kurzerhand umquartiert \u2013 f\u00fcr den Wein tun sie im Grand Lisboa fast alles. M\u00f6glicherweise wird man in naher Zukunft knapp die H\u00e4lfte aller Weine bestaunen k\u00f6nnen. Sch\u00fcrmann und sein Team hegen Pl\u00e4ne, in den kommenden Jahren eine Weingalerie mit einem Raum zum Degustieren zu bauen.Doch zuerst muss sich Sch\u00fcrmann noch um ein anderes Projekt k\u00fcmmern, dem Bau des Grand Lisboa Palace. Das Prestigeprojekt umfasst mehrere Hotels, unter anderem auch das erste Haus, das der verstorbenen Modezar Karl Lagerfeld gestaltet hat.Kosten in Milliardenh\u00f6heDie Er\u00f6ffnung ist mittlerweile auf 2020 angesetzt. Und nat\u00fcrlich verf\u00fcgt auch das Grand Lisboa Palace \u00fcber ein Casino. Zum Gl\u00fcck, ist man versucht zu sagen. Denn der Bau verschlingt nicht weniger als 5 Milliarden Dollar (TN)."

            "description": "Pomp and pageantry were on full display across mainland China on Tuesday as the country celebrated 70 years since the nation's Communist Party, led by Mao Zedong, defeated the Nationalist Party in a civil war to form the People's Republic of China on Oct. 1, 1949.China's president Xi Jinping, who has the mandate to lead indefinitely, used a National Day speech ahead of an impressive military display and parade to highlight the Communist Party's role in advancing China. \"No force can stop the Chinese people and the Chinese nation forging ahead,\" Xi told a crowd of carefully vetted guests in Tiananmen Square, per Bloomberg.He also outlined that he was committed to a \"peaceful reunification and one country, two systems\" for Hong Kong \u2013 a special administrative state of China that has endured months of pro-democracy demonstrations after widespread perception that Beijing has impeded upon the freedoms it promised to Hong Kong when the city returned to mainland rule in 1997 after 156 years of British ownership.China's primary stock index \u2013 the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index (SSE) \u2013 closed Friday down nearly 1%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index (HSI) posted a 0.53% gain to close out last week.As China's National Day holiday carries on this week, traders should closely monitor these three exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that provide exposure to both Chinese and Hong Kong stocks. Let's take a more detailed look at the metrics of each fund and parade through several trading possibilities.Direxion Daily FTSE China Bull 3X Shares (YINN)Launched in 2009, the Direxion Daily FTSE China Bull 3X Shares (YINN) aims to return three times the daily performance of the FTSE China 50 Index. The fund provides geared exposure to the 50 largest Chinese stocks traded in Hong Kong, making it a suitable instrument for traders who want an aggressive short-term bullish bet on Sino equities. Top weightings in the ETF's basket include multinational conglomerate Tencent Holdings Limited (TCEHY) at 9.18%, China Construction Bank Corporation (CICHY) at 9.13%, and Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China Ltd. (PNGAY) at 7.67%. Ample daily volume of more than 2 million shares and a narrow 0.06% average spread keep trading costs manageable. The fund's 1.52% management fee isn't cheap but has minimal impact on short holding periods. YINN has net assets of $319 million, offers a 2.20% dividend yield, and is trading down 3.44% year to date (YTD) as of Oct. 1, 2019.The ETF's share price has traded within a descending channel over the past six months to establish clear support and resistance areas on the chart. As China's National Day celebrations continue, traders should watch for moves to the pattern's top or bottom trendline for opportunities. If the price falls to the lower trendline, consider going long and setting a profit target near the channel's opposing side. Alternatively, look to open a short position if price rallies into the upper trendline and book profits on a retracement back down to the pattern's lower support line. For trades in either direction, place stop orders about $1 from entry.StockCharts.comXtrackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF (ASHR)With assets under management (AUM) of $1.35 billion, the Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF (ASHR) seeks investment results that correspond to the performance of the CSI 300 Index. The fund comprises 300 liquid Chinese stocks traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, providing U.S. investors with access to exclusive China A-shares. ASHR, which has an expense ratio of 0.66%, takes a significant tilt toward financials, with the ETF allocating roughly 40% of its portfolio to the sector. Ping An Insurance commands the top stock weighting at 7.68%, followed by partially state-owned food and beverage giant Kweichow Moutai Co., Ltd. (600519.SS) at 4.70% and China Merchants Bank Co., Ltd. (CIHKY) at 2.91%. With over 4 million shares changing hands daily coupled with a narrow 0.04% spread, the ETF meets the requirements of active traders. As of Oct. 1, 2019, ASHR yields 1.07% and has returned nearly 25% on the year.ASHR shares trended over 40% higher between January and early April but have remained entrenched within a trading range since. Over the past two weeks, the fund's price has retraced to the $27 level, which finds a confluence of support from the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) and an uptrend line that forms part of a broad symmetrical triangle. Those who buy here should look for a retest of the 2019 YTD high at $30.79 and manage risk with a stop-loss order situated below the discussed support area.StockCharts.comiShares MSCI Hong Kong ETF (EWH)The iShares MSCI Hong Kong ETF (EWH) has an objective to deliver returns similar to the MSCI Hong Kong Index. Its benchmark covers 85% of firms listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE) while taking a sizable sector lean toward financials (67.46%). Notable companies in the ETF's basket of 48 holdings include AIA Group Limited (AAGIY), Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKXCY), and CK Hutchison Holdings Limited (CKHUY). The massive $1.42 billion fund turns over roughly 7 million shares per day on an average penny spread and charges a competitive 0.48% management fee. As of Oct. 1, 2019, the ETF yields a respectable 3.13% but has only eked out a meager 2.64% YTD gain.A descending channel, similar to the one on YINN's chart, has played out since early May. The 50-day SMA crossed below the 200-day SMA earlier this month in what technical analysts refer to as a bearish \"death cross.\" Therefore, traders should expect further selling but look for opportunities to initiate long positions near crucial support at $21.50 \u2013 an area where the fund may find buyers near the channel pattern's lower trendline. Those who trade this support zone should think about setting a take-profit order near the channel's top trendline at $25 and placing stops under $21.",

The dirt track leading to the army\u2019s Wacha outpost in the Kibithu sector along the Line of Actual Control.(Rahul Singh/HT Photo)Not everyone can do Moutai, a grain-based baijiu that has a high alcohol content of 53% (compared to Black Label\u2019s 40%) and costs around \u20b915,000 for a half litre bottle, said two army officers posted in Arunachal Pradesh\u2019s Kibithu sector where more than 4,000 Chinese soldiers were killed in the Battle of Walong \u2013 one of the few glorious chapters for India in the 1962 India-China war.Stay tuned with breaking news on HT Channel on Facebook. Join NowBut swigging down a few shots helps strike a rapport with the Chinese commanders, said the first officer. Moutai is the staple drink served by the Chinese at all official banquets and ceremonial functions such as the border personnel meetings (BPMs) that were held along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) at three locations in Arunachal Pradesh and one in Ladakh on China\u2019s 70th National Day on October 1.One such BPM was held at Damai on the Chinese side of the LAC facing the Indian Army\u2019s Wacha outpost.At Damai, Indian and Chinese army officers talked about the positive outcome of the first informal summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in April 2018 and also proposed a toast to the upcoming second edition of the meeting (to be held later this month), said the second officer.Mao Zedong and other top communist leaders toasted with Moutai when the People\u2019s Republic of China was founded in 1949. It was Chairman Mao\u2019s favourite tipple.\u201cThe delegations, consisting of eight officers each, talked about the Wuhan spirit and the second informal summit. There has been no incident along the LAC in this sector during the last one-and-a-half years,\u201d Indian delegation leader Brigadier Sajeev Katarya told Hindustan Times.While Katarya is a teetotaller, other delegation members and guests had Moutai shots with their Chinese hosts.Katarya, who is the commander of the Tezu-based 82 Mountain Brigade, said the border situation was likely to improve further after the second summit as everything was \u201ctop-driven\u201d in the India-China bilateral relationship.\u201cWe are sanguine that border guarding troops of both countries will fulfil the shared responsibility of peace and tranquility as per the strategic guidance given by the top leadership of both countries,\u201d he said.There may have been no friction with the Chinese in the Kibithu sector that covers almost half of Arunachal Pradesh, but isolated incidents keep taking place every now and then --- such as the face-off between Indian and Chinese troops near the northern bank of the Pangong lake in Ladakh in September. Also, border tensions peaked when the two neighbours were locked in a long standoff in the disputed Doklam plateau near Sikkim two years ago.While talks between India and China on the boundary issue under the framework of the Special Representatives (SR) mechanism have been delayed, experts said the border situation could witness further improvement after the second informal summit.Lieutenant General SL Narasimhan (retd), a China expert and currently a member of the National Security Advisory Board, said notwithstanding the face-off that took place in Pangong Tso area, the LAC has been more stable since the Wuhan Summit and things were likely to get even better after the second informal Modi-Xi meet.\u201cWhile India has to remain alert in the wake of China\u2019s reactions to the revocation of Articles 370 and 35-A {relating to Jammu and Kashmir}, China may not create any unpleasant situation on the LAC, particularly with the second informal summit between the two leaders expected soon,\u201d he said.He said reforms in the People\u2019s Liberation Army were going on at a fast pace and India needed to take note of it and ensure that its defensive capability was adequate.India and China have held more than 20 rounds of talks under the SR mechanism to settle the dispute over the 3,488-km LAC. Equally, concerted efforts by soldiers to develop a taste for the heady Moutai are also a work in progress.\u201cThe best thing about Moutai is that it doesn\u2019t give you a hangover. It also helps you bond better with the Chinese,\u201d said Narasimhan.",

            "description": "It did not take long for the initial frenzy surrounding the opening of Costco Wholesale Corp.'s first store in China to fizzle out.The U.S. bulk retailer's Shanghai site launched Aug. 27 to queues so large that it was reportedly forced to shut early and limit admittance to 2,000 customers at a time. Costco CFO Richard Galanti said a remarkable 139,000 people signed up for membership on that first day, Yahoo Finance reported.Yet local Chinese media reported Sept. 2 that customers were canceling their memberships as prices of certain items were raised and highly sought-after products, such as Kweichow Moutai Co. Ltd. liquor, were no longer available. Costco briefly offered the iconic drink at 1,000 yuan below its retail price again before customers returned in droves.While flash sales may continue to be effective in drawing crowds, Costco faces an uphill battle if it is to enjoy long term success in the Chinese market. The Issaquah, Wash., company is up against stiff competition from deep-pocketed homegrown e-commerce players such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com Inc. that are branching into physical retail, as well as established brick-and-mortar companies like Yonghui Superstores Co. Ltd.It is also a relatively late entrant to a market that has proven difficult for international companies to gain a foothold in, and many are on the retreat. France-based Carrefour SA in June agreed to sell an 80% majority stake in its 234-site Chinese operations to local home appliances retailer Suning.com Co. Ltd. Germany's Metro AG is said to be nearing a deal to sell its China business, with a host of Chinese companies reportedly interested.Costco did not reply to S&P Global Market Intelligence's requests for comment.The ongoing U.S.-China tariff war may be the most acute and immediate challenge for Costco. Unlike its rival Walmart Inc., which says that 95% of the merchandise sold in its Chinese stores is sourced locally, Costco imports about 50% of products at its Shanghai warehouse. U.S. agricultural and food imports including wheat, seafood and pork are subject to tariffs as high as 62%.Zhang Ruohai, chief data analyst at CITIC Securities, said the tariff issue will impact Costco's pricing strategy in the short to mid-term and may affect foot traffic at its store.\"Costco has less stock keeping units on its online platform and its prices are not that much different from its online competitors. There is very little incentive for customers to sign up for membership if they do not shop at the physical store. Therefore Costco has to focus on keeping its prices competitive at its store,\" said Zhang.Foot traffic is especially important as Costco generates about 10% of its revenue from membership fees. Its basic Gold star fee is 299 yuan in China, the lowest Costco offers across its operations in the Asia-Pacific region, which include Taiwan, Japan and South Korea.Richard Zhang, Costco's senior vice president for Asia, told AFP in an interview that some fresh produce from the U.S. has been replaced with imports from Australia in an effort to keep prices low. But supply chain diversification is unlikely to be sustainable, especially for warehouse chain operators of limited scale, according to Wai-Chan Chan, global consumer goods practice leader at consultancy Oliver Wyman.\"Sourcing is a problem for any retailer that opens one or two shops in the beginning. There's no scale for private labels, or for anything. They can actually lose money. That would be the challenge,\" he explained.Chan noted that retailers face the difficult prospect of having to expand fast and accept a loss in the short term in order to gain a foothold in the market, but Costco seems keen to take a conservative approach for now. CFO Galanti told analysts during its third-quarter earnings call in May that Costco will open another store in China in about a year or two, provided that \"all things go well.\"\"China's a little unique in many ways, aside from any issues right now with tariffs. That's not hopefully a long-term issue. Each item has to be registered separately. We're fortunate in the sense that we have a successful operation in Taiwan, [from] which we were able to bring some key people. But we want to hire from within and like we do in other countries,\" Galanti said during the call.In contrast, Walmart plans to open 40 Sam's Clubs members-only outlets in China by 2020 and spend $1.2 billion on logistics. The company entered China in 1996 and has had a bumpy ride, with store closures and frequent management changes a feature of its time in the country. But it is by far the most longstanding international peers, with 400 sites under its various store formats.Digital firstChan said the struggles of foreign retailers are not largely down to a failure to localize as most have made efforts to hire local teams, as Galanti alluded to, and adapt their product mixes to Chinese tastes. Rather, it is a lack of a strong digital presence that has impeded their growth.\"The future of grocery retailers and foreign companies in China is about being part of an ecosystem. Now you need a digital footprint to drive traffic to the store,\" Chan said, citing Walmart and Taiwanese chain RT MART International Ltd's tie-ups with JD.com and Alibaba, respectively, to act as fulfillment centers for their online grocery business.Notably, Walmart sold off its lackluster online business Yihaodian in 2016 to JD.com in return for a 5% in the Chinese e-commerce retailer. Both companies later invested $500 million in grocery delivery business Dada-JD Daojia. Walmart's merchandise, including goods from Sam's Club, can be bought on the Dada-JD Daojia platform and delivered to the doorstep in as fast as half an hour.Alibaba has made no secret of its commitment to the \"new retail\" model, which seeks to remove the boundaries between physical and online commerce. It plans to roll out more of its Hema grocery stores and continue to invest in delivery services.The challenge these cash-rich, internet-first competitors pose is stark. A study carried out by CITIC's Zhang tracking the average price difference between Costco and the Metro hypermarkets found that Costco was cheaper by 38.8% on 40 locally sourced food, beverage and daily items. In comparison, the price advantage offered on its e-commerce platform was only 0.2%.Costco is yet to offer this type of proposition but it has had an online store on Alibaba's Tmall platform since 2014, through which it sells its private-label Kirkland goods. Oliver Wyman's Chan noted that such products have struggled to gain traction in China.\"Private label will always be a difficult thing to do in China, compared to other parts of the world. The most successful companies still have very low participation when it comes to private labels in their businesses,\" said Chan.Jason Yu, general manager for Greater China at market research provider Kantar Worldpanel, said that while Costco's online store has barely registered on the radar, the initial reception of its Shanghai warehouse shows that there is a place for its core proposition in the country.\"Costco has to offer differentiation by offering high quality, often imported products because their target audience is middle-income, car-owning households from first tier cities,\" said Yu. \"High quality fresh produce, food and daily items will always have strong demand among Chinese consumers.\"As of Sept. 26, US$1 was equivalent to 7.13 yuan.",

            "description": "Mit mehr als 155 verschiedenen Aromen ist Kweichow Moutai eine wahre Geschmacksexplosion und der prominenteste Vertreter der Baijiu-Kategorie, Chinas Nationalspirituose. Baijiu hei\u00dft nichts anderes als \u201ewei\u00dfer Alkohol\u201c und Moutai gilt als qualitativ hochwertigster und faszinierendster Baijiu.Die Nachfrage \u00fcbersteigt das Angebot. So ist das Destillat aus Bio Sorghum nur begrenzt verf\u00fcgbar, sein Flagschiff Moutai Flying Fairy dem Handel limitiert zugeteilt und der halbe Liter bringt es aktuell auf eine UVP von rund 200,00 Euro. Mitte September 2019 war es soweit: Kweichow Moutai gab sein Deb\u00fct in der Hamburger Kultbar Christiansen\u2018s Fine Drinks and Cocktails und begeisterte die geladenen Professionals. Kein geringerer als Spirituosenexperte J\u00fcrgen Deibel f\u00fchrte die G\u00e4ste in die Welt der chinesischen Spirituose ein. Im Anschluss \u00fcberzeugte Barchef Uwe Christiansen die Teilnehmer pers\u00f6nlich von der ungeahnten Mixability des Destillats aus Rothirse und Weizen und stellte eine Auswahl an unkomplizierten Cocktails mit Moutai vor. Am Ende waren sich Bartender, Gastronomen und Journalisten einig: Moutai ist ein wirklich ungew\u00f6hnliches Produkt mit gro\u00dfem Potential.Kweichow Moutai wird ausschlie\u00dflich im S\u00fcdwesten Chinas in der Provinz Guizhou, in der namensgebenden Stadt Moutai (oder Maotai) produziert. In einem sehr arbeits- und zeitintensiven Herstellungsprozess werden hierf\u00fcr Rothirse, das Wasser des Flusses Chishui und die sagenumwobene Mischung Qu (sprich Tsch\u00fc) fermentiert und vielfach gebrannt. Die anschlie\u00dfende Lagerung in Reifegruben sorgt neben den ungew\u00f6hnlichen Zutaten f\u00fcr den letzten Schliff des au\u00dfergew\u00f6hnlichen und f\u00fcr den europ\u00e4ischen Gaumen v\u00f6llig unbekannten Geschmacks. \u201eWir m\u00fcssen f\u00fcr dieses Produkt offen sein und ein Verst\u00e4ndnis entwickeln \u2013 Moutai und andere Baijius bilden in Sachen Geschmack und Herstellung eine Kategorie, die mit keiner europ\u00e4ischen oder amerikanischen Spirituose zu vergleichen ist\u201c, betont J\u00fcrgen Deibel. Dieses Verst\u00e4ndnis ist in China so grundlegend und selbstverst\u00e4ndlich wie Bier trinken in Deutschland und genie\u00dft eine lange Tradition: In und um den Ort Moutai werden bereits seit mehr als 2000 Jahren Baijius produziert. Schon im Jahr 135 v. Chr. wurde der Vorg\u00e4nger des Moutais, der dort produzierte Juijang-Schnaps, als kaiserliches Tribut auserkoren. Auch heute genie\u00dft Moutai in China ein sehr hohes Ansehen und wird als exklusives Geschenk gesch\u00e4tzt. Vintage-Jahrg\u00e4nge erzielen auf Auktionen Preise von vielen hunderttausend Euro.Bei Moutai ist die Produktion geografisch begrenzt: So darf Moutai ausschlie\u00dflich in der Stadt Moutai hergestellt werden \u2013 eine Auflage, die mit der geografisch limitierten Herkunftsbezeichnung europ\u00e4ischer Spirituosen wie dem Cognac vergleichbar ist. Es d\u00fcrfen ausschlie\u00dflich Produkte aus der Region f\u00fcr die Herstellung verwendet werden. Um die beste Qualit\u00e4t des Wassers zu garantieren, ist es beispielsweise Fabriken verboten, in N\u00e4he des Flusses zu produzieren.\u201eWir Chinesen kennen und sch\u00e4tzen den einzigartigen Geschmack eines Moutais und legen darum besonderen Wert auf eine ausgezeichnete Qualit\u00e4t der Grundzutaten und die Herstellung. So genie\u00dfen wir unseren Moutai gern pur in speziellen, kleinen Gl\u00e4sern zum Essen. Nat\u00fcrlich wissen wir, dass die Geschmacksnoten f\u00fcr den europ\u00e4ischen Gaumen noch recht ungewohnt sind. Ein Weg hin zum deutschen Moutai-Erlebnis sind darum Cocktails,\u201c erl\u00e4utert Wilson Lo, Direktor von Wisdom Express, dem autorisierten Moutai H\u00e4ndler in Deutschland.Das dies der richtige Weg f\u00fcr den deutschen Markt ist, zeigte sich w\u00e4hrend des Tastings im Christiansen\u2018s: Der Moutai ist ein wahrer Allrounder und harmoniert mit s\u00fc\u00dfen, herben, bitteren oder salzigen Noten. Auch in fruchtiger Kombination wie der \u201eGreat Wall\u201c Kreation, als Moutai Mary oder Moutai Esspressini von Uwe Christiansen konnte die Spirituose \u00fcberzeugen: \u201eMich fasziniert neben der geschmacklichen Vielseitigkeit des Moutai vor allem auch die Vielzahl der Geschichten, die er mitbringt. Und eine gute Geschichte hinter einem Cocktail ist mindestens so wichtig, wie sein Geschmack.\u201cAuf dem deutschen Markt sind aktuell drei Moutai-Qualit\u00e4ten verf\u00fcgbar: Flying Fairy, Prince und Yingbin. Sie werden \u00fcber den gehobenen und spezialisierten Fach- sowie Einzelhandel und chinesischen Premium-Restaurants vertrieben. Ein on-pack Paket mit zwei der typischen Moutai-Gl\u00e4ser wird in K\u00fcrze verf\u00fcgbar sein. Interessenten wenden sich an Wisdom Express.Quelle/Bildquelle: Wisdom Express GmbH"

            "description": "China\u2019s premium white liquor brand Kweichow Moutai has been facing a long-standing problem \u2013 speculators pushing up the price of its highly sought product to irrational highs with little benefit to the brand. The problem has become so acute that average Chinese consumers can rarely access the liquor. But with the opening of Costco in Shanghai, Kweichow Moutai saw a new solution for cuting out the speculators, hatching a plan in just seven days.Two days before Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival, which falls on Friday this year, Kweichow Moutai sold 5 tons, or 10,000 bottles, of the liquor via Costco Shanghai. Notably, the price of the product sold at Costco is RMB1,499 (US$211), while the same product sold by some liquor retailers can be up to RMB2,600 (US$365).Consumers buy Moutai at Costco Shanghai. Source: MoutaiSpaceOn Weibo, China\u2019s microblog equivalent to Twitter, some internet users openly shared their excitement in buying the liquor. One user exclaimed \u201cI\u2019m the Costco winner today!\u201d along with a picture of three bottles of Moutai.\u201cOn the first day [of the two-day sales], about 5,000 consumers came to buy Moutai\u2026 We didn\u2019t publicise the two-day event,\u201d Chinese new media platform MoutaiSpace reported.With a brand reputation as China\u2019s most famous liquor, Moutai is not only a consumer product but has also become a good investment for those who can get their hands on it. Such buying by speculators has driven Moutai prices up year after year. A special bottle of Moutai even sold atRMB8.9 million (US$1.25 million).Against this backdrop, Moutai has been trying for years to adopt a simple sales model that eliminates intermediate trading companies and directly sells to consumers.Consumers line up at Costco Shanghai. Source: MoutaiSpace\u201cDirected sales help true lovers of Moutai get access our liquor, while also curb speculation and similar activities that have disturbed market rules,\u201d Chinese business news outlet nbd.com.cn reported, citing a Moutai sales manager.According to the manager, the sight of Costco members fighting for Moutai liquor at the supermarket caught the attention of Moutai\u2019s management, who quickly cooperated with Costco to finalise an agreement within seven days.As one Costco Shanghai manager described the 'Moutai Effect': \u201cWe heard of Moutai liquor before, but the opening of Costco in Shanghai made us feel how influential Moutai is in China,\u201d the manager told MoutaiSpace. The manager said most members of Costco are middle class with great consumption power who are buying Moutai to give to others as gifts or to drink by themselves.\u201cWe made the right decision [to cooperate with Moutai],\u201d the manager said.The return of lineups to Costco was a welcome sight for US-based bulk retailer. Last week, Campaign Asia Pacific reported that consumers start to return their membership cards after the supermarket hiked prices.",

On August 27 Costco opened its first Chinese branch in the suburbs of Shanghai, and ordinarily you might not expect a lot of people to show up for shopping on a Tuesday morning. However, as these videos and photos show, Shanghai was perfectly willing to get up early in order to get some deals.History will remember this moment, they open the door like this. (Costco Shanghai China) pic.twitter.com/Mf79SWt750 \u2014 manta (@manta_chen) August 29, 2019That\u2019s an amassed crowd of people so eager to get into the store that they begin crawling under the entrance shutter even before it\u2019s done being raised. And if you think things were any less competitive once they got inside, think again. Video shows shoppers emptying cardboard shipping boxes as soon as they\u2019re placed on the floor and multiple sets of hands tugging at the same cuts of meat the moment the butcher lays them in the sales case. Then there was the human wall of security personnel that had to be stationed at the entrance for crowd control.Sure. The crowd I had at checkout was at 9:25am, well before it turned chaotic. Also, this 12k RMB Burberry cape fascinated me. China is an exotic place, I\u2019ll tell you what. pic.twitter.com/mbcE2w36Bt \u2014 Natalie Judd (@NatAttack) August 27, 2019Eventually the sea of shoppers became so dense that Costco decided to close early for the day, shutting down shortly after 1 p.m., roughly eight hours earlier than its scheduled closing time. This no doubt came as a shock to those who were still waiting in the three-hour-long line to park their cars in Costco\u2019s lot.Huge crowds showed up the second day too, though Costco installed a new policy limiting the number of shoppers allowed inside to 2,000 at any given time.Costco is charging 299 yuan (US$42.30) for year-long memberships in China, though those who pre-registered online were able to do so at a 33-percent discount. However, China-based website Shanghaiist reports that while Costco has already met its goal of 100,000 memberships in China, a number of people are already thinking of canceling theirs. The reason? Apparently a significant part of Costco\u2019s appeal in China came from it being a low-priced supplier of the Maotai brand of baiju, a clear distilled sorghum liquor, produced by Chinese government-owned distiller Kweichow Moutai. However, Costco has faced a shortage after selling out of its initial stock of the spirit, Shanghaiist says, leaving some Costco members pondering whether or not it\u2019s worth sticking with the relationship if it doesn\u2019t include cheap Maotai.Sources: Hachima Kiko, Shanghaiist, ReutersTop image: Wikipedia/JesseW900\u25cf Want to hear about SoraNews24\u2019s latest articles as soon as they\u2019re published?

Li hinted that the partnership will focus on the long-term applications of microbiology to alcohol production.In May last year, Moutai and BGI confirmed that they were seeking to cooperate in areas including microbiology and genomics. At the time, Li said microbiology was Moutai\u2019s most important development driver and he believed a forward-looking strategy was essential to ensure the continued quality of the company\u2019s throat-burning liquors.And as early as 2009, Moutai jointly launched a genomics study with BGI, which found more than 1,000 microbes are involved in the making of Moutai liquor.Moutai is also seeking to improve its brewing technology, according to a stock filing. The distiller produced more than 45,300 tons of base liquor in the first six months of 2019.Contact reporter Zhao Runhua (runhuazhao@caixin.com)Related: Moutai Liquor Ups Retail Quotas to Bypass Baijiu Barons",

QFII, set up in 2002, lets foreign funds invest onshore in China's yuan-denominated A shares. The RQFII programme, introduced in 2011, gives investors access to offshore renminbi to buy mainland-traded stocks.The removal of the first quota, after 17 years of a gradual, regulated opening of China's equities, removes one of the major vestiges of the country's closed capital markets. It is also a nod to the ongoing negotiations to resolve the year-long US-China trade war, which has sought to remove restrictions on foreign investments, address American concerns of China's track record on intellectual property, among other trade issues.\"The move is an important measure that China has taken to further open up the financial markets,\" said Min Liangchao, a strategist at HSBC Jintrust Fund Management in Shanghai. \"In the long run, it will attract more overseas funds to the A-share market.

They need to go through the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) scheme, in which banks and asset management firms invest on behalf of individual investors after getting quotas from the government.To some extent, the two programmes had become redundant ever since a cross-border investment channel known as the Stock Connect was established in 2014 to allow mainland investors transact in Hong Kong-traded stocks, and for foreign investors to buy and sell equities in Shanghai and Shenzhen.Unlike the QFII and RQFII systems, investors using the Connect link can buy stocks without requiring licenses granted by the currency or securities regulators.The first Connect programme between the Shanghai and Hong Kong bourses in November 2014 quickly expanded to include the Shenzhen exchange, and now the London exchange. Similar channels have been established for bonds, and even commodities.Foreign investors have been playing an increasingly prominent role in China's stocks market. They held a combined 1.68 trillion yuan of Chinese stocks as of the first quarter, closing in on the total stock holdings of China's mutual funds.They have been buying Chinese consumer stocks from liquor distiller Kweichow Moutai and duty-free shop operator China International Travel Service, sending their stock prices to records this year. Another stock, Han's Laset Technology, was so well sought after by offshore investors that trading in its shares had to be halted in May because the limit on foreign ownership was reached.The quota removal may also ease the frayed trade relation between China and the United States, as the two nations return to the negotiating table next month to resolve their year-long trade war. The Trump administration had pushed China to remove barriers to global capital, including the removal of ownership limits on banks, and better access to the country's wealth management and investment products.In response, the Chinese government has deregulated the capital and banking markets to give foreign investors greater access. In April 2018, Beijing lifted a limit, giving foreign brokers majority control of their mainland ventures. Last month, the asset management unit of JPMorgan Chase & Co. became the first foreign institution to take control of a Chinese asset management firm.\"China has reasons to further open up its markets to global investors and companies because foreign funds and foreign trade are undoubtedly instrumental in buoying the country's economic growth,\" said Professor Quan Heng, a research fellow at Fudan University's Research Institute of China Economy. \"It is advisable for the central government to drastically conduct liberalisations sooner rather than later.\"Beijing doubled the total QFII quota to US$300 billion at the beginning of this year to facilitate foreign institutions' purchase of mainland equities after global indices compilers such as MSCI increased the weighting of A shares in their equity gauges.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

            "description": "Remember last week when the Shanghai opening of China's first Costco created such a consumer swarm that the store had to temporarily shut down? At the time, people asked how long the blowout would last, given the slowing economy and US-China trade war weighing on domestic consumption.Now, we kind of have the answer: one week.Now, instead of eagerly rushing into the store and fighting over discounted goods, consumers are lining up to return their membership cards. A Weibo hashtag, #costcoMembersReturningCards, has generated 250 million views and 11,000 discussions as of this morning. China magazine The People reported Monday that so many consumers were lining up to return their cards that \u201ca staff member has no time to have lunch at 2 pm.\u201dWhat happened? A 31-year-old Shanghai resident surnamed Xie seemed to speak for many consumers when she said she is considering returning her membership card because \u201cCostco goods are not attractive enough for me.\u201d\u201cThere are not many things you can buy,\" the woman told Campaign Asia-Pacific. \"For example, there are 36 bread buns in a bag. For downtown residents surrounded by supermarkets and convenience stores, who need so many buns? [The supermarket] is too crowded. I perhaps will not go there again within several months.\u201dAccording to The People article, Costco price-hiking led many consumers to return their cards. The supermarket stopped offering some of the hot goods that made an impact at launch, such as Herm\u00e8s\u2019 Birkin bags and domestically famous Kweichow Moutai liquor, three days after its opening. Meanwhile, the price of a pack of two 1.89-liter Wei Chuan milks rose to RMB53.9 (US$7.50) from RMB32.9 (US$4.60), while the price of another domestically famous liquor, Wuliangye, went from RMB919 (US$128) to RMB1,069 (US$149), the magazine reported.Relevant discussions on Weibo focus on whether consumers should return their cards after price hikes. Under the above hashtag, a user named '\u5241\u624b\u5241\u811a\u7684\u5927\u8def\u8def' blamed consumers for a lack of contractual spirit. \u201cThough they don\u2019t violate rules [by returning membership cards], their behaviours are not decent,\" the user wrote. \"That\u2019s the reason why many foreign brands have sound after-sales and return policies in other markets than China.\u201dHowever, many commented that Costco screwed up its hunger marketing. \u201cIt\u2019s normal [for consumers to return membership cards] and proves that your marketing plan has defects,\" wrote a Weibo user named '\u813e\u6c14\u66b4\u8e81\u7684\u5c0f\u9a91\u58eb'. \"You attract consumers to apply for membership cards with discounted goods and a promise to return cards. Since you have raised prices, consumers have the right to return cards according to your policy\u2026 Costco break the rules and consumers just follow it.\u201dImmediately after its blowout grand opening in Shanghai, Costco CFO Richard Galanti said the company is planning to open a second store in Shanghai, China Knowledge reported.",

            "description": "Scandal-plagued Kweichow Moutai Co. Ltd., the world\u2019s most valuable distiller and China\u2019s first trillion-yuan company, has instructed its army of dealers to up the amount of liquor they sell directly to retailers in order to cut out potentially corrupt intermediaries.At a corporate meeting on Wednesday the company instructed dealers to keep a maximum of 20% of their stock in their inventory and sell at least 60% to retailers such as supermarkets, according to a statement (link in Chinese) released on the company's website.They were instructed to sell no more than 20% to other distributors.The move aims to streamline sales channels and crack down on abnormal pricing, said Li Baofang, the new chairman of parent Kweichow Moutai Group.It follows a major overhaul intended to increase direct sales of Moutai and reduce middlemen which began this year, alongside revelations the company\u2019s distribution model was underpinned by graft. The distiller has long relied on its huge dealers\u2019 network to sell the luxury liquor, but many dealers have been handing out lucrative distribution licenses in exchange for bribes. Secondary distributors often hoarded their inventory causing prices to spike.The official retail price for a new, 500-milliliter bottle of Moutai is currently 1,499 yuan ($220). But supply shortages mean the market price tends to be much higher. Prices for a bottle of Moutai exceed 2,500 yuan in Guizhou, Shandong and Henan provinces, Caixin has learned. Industry analyst Cai Xuefei told Caixin that the market price reached as high as 2,800 yuan elsewhere.Moutai\u2019s namesake spirit is often described as China\u2019s national liquor, and is regularly served at state banquets and presented as a gift. Distilled from fermented sorghum and other ingredients, the product is known for its high alcohol content and powerful, complex taste. The liquor is not only popular among consumers, but also coveted by collectors for its potential appreciation.In May, Moutai\u2019s former Chairman Yuan Renguo was arrested for taking a \u201cmassive\u201d amount of bribes and other \u201csevere violations of discipline and law,\u201d according to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the country\u2019s top disciplinary watchdog.After Yuan left the company, his successor Li Baofang launched an effort to fight internal graft and clean up its dealers. According to Moutai\u2019s 2019 sales plans, 17,000 tons of liquor are assigned to dealer channels, accounting for about 55% of the total sales target, down from about 80% in 2017.The company also took out 400 tons of sales quota from the listed company to three nationwide supermarket chain operators: Wumart Stores Inc., China Resources Vanguard Co. Ltd. and KangCheng Investment (China) Co. Ltd., in a bid to sell more liquor directly to consumers. Wumart announced last month that it will sell Moutai\u2019s Feitian brand for 1,499 yuan a bottle.Denise Jia contributed to the report.Contact reporter Tang Ziyi (ziyitang@caixin.com)",

            "description": "SHANGHAI (BLOOMBERG) - China's largest hotpot chain, whose co-founders are Singapore's newest billionaires, is whetting the appetite of investors as well as diners.Haidilao International Holding, one of the largest additions to the MSCI Emerging Markets Index by market capitalisation, has surged more than 78 per cent since its Hong Kong listing last September while the Hang Sang Index slipped about 8.5 per cent in the same period.Analysts believe there's still steam left in this rally: the 12-month consensus target price of HK$33 (S$5.84) is about 4 per cent above the stock's current level.The stock gained as much as 2.4 per cent in early Hong Kong trading on Tuesday.The Sichuan-based firm is the market leader in hotpot in China, a segment that accounts for almost 14 per cent of the country's US$21 billion restaurant scene, according to data from Frost & Sullivan.Its co-founders are the latest entrants to Forbes magazine's list of Singapore billionaires this year. Mr Zhang Yong, 48, is the Republic's third-richest person with a net worth of US$6.8 billion (S$9.2 billion) while his wife, Ms Shu Ping, 49, is ranked 14th with a net worth of US$1.8 billion. Both Mr Zhang and Ms Shu are Singapore citizens, according to Forbes.Haidilao's lack of listed rivals - there's only one other hotpot stock, Xiabuxiabu - has added to its lure, prompting comparisons with Kweichow Moutai, the world's most profitable distiller whose fiery drink is coveted and hard to procure.The projected rapid growth of hotpot in China is also expected to benefit Haidilao by shoring up its front-runner status, said analysts.Frost & Sullivan projects hotpot chains to grow 10.2 per cent by 2022 to reach revenue of over 700 billion yuan (S$137.5 billion), outpacing the restaurant industry as a whole.\"The hotpot market in China is still extremely fragmented,\" Arnold Tam, Hong Kong-based analyst at Bright Smart Securities, said in an email. \"Haidilao's market share is expected to rise as the industry evolves towards strengthening the strongest players.\"While the Chinese economy is growing at its slowest pace in three decades and consumer confidence is waning, the food industry is still relatively insulated. Amid a sluggish world economy and geopolitical uncertainty, Haidilao's revenue is projected to grow 60 per cent this year and 40 per cent next year, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Customers are willing to queue for hours to get a table at one of its over 500 outlets in China, encouraged by the chain's provision of perks like free manicures, shoulder massages and dance performances. It also runs a delivery service that sends a pot, an induction cooker and fresh food to customers at home.",

            "description": "Amid a U.S. delegation sent to Shanghai this week to resume stalled trade negotiations, President Donald Trump fired off a tweet accusing China of not following through on promises to buy more U.S. agricultural products. In a rapid escalation that caught many market watchers by surprise, the president announced Thursday that the United States will start imposing 10% tariffs on $300 billion worth of additional Chinese goods, including electronics, apparel, footwear, and toys.News of a fresh round of duties leveled at the world's second-largest economy comes just two days after economic data released from China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that manufacturing activity remained sluggish in July. While the country's manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) inched up to 49.7 last month from 49.4 in June, it remains below the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction, reflecting the challenges from ongoing trade tensions.\"Despite the uptick in July, economic conditions haven't improved since June,\" Larry Hu, an economist at Macquarie Group Limited, told The Wall Street Journal. \"The Chinese economy is still in the middle of a downturn cycle. The worst hasn't come yet,\" Hu added.Those who want to position for more volatility in Chinese stocks as the trade war between Washington and Beijing rages on should consider trading these three China inverse exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that go up as stock markets go down. Below, we examine the metrics of each fund and consider several trading plays to profit from further bearish price action.ProShares UltraShort FTSE China 50 (FXP)Formed in 2007 and charging a 0.95% management fee, the ProShares UltraShort FTSE China 50 (FXP) seeks to return two times the inverse daily performance of the FTSE China 50 Index. The ETF's benchmark comprises 50 large-capitalization stocks listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Significant exposure to financials (45.70%) and communication services (18.90%) makes the fund suitable for those who want to bet against sectors dominated by state-owned enterprises. Technology conglomerate Tencent Holdings Limited (TCEHY) commands the top allocation in the underlying index at 9.18%. Daily dollar volume liquidity of over $5 million combined with a narrow 0.03% average spread keep trading costs manageable. As of Aug. 2, 2019, FXP controls assets under management (AUM) of $33.22 million, offers a 0.81% dividend yield, and has slumped 16.94% year to date (YTD).The ETF's share price tracked lower between January and April before rallying 20% in May. Price fell toward the 2019 YTD low in June as hopes of a trade deal breakthrough gained momentum after President Trump met with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in a sideline meeting at the Group of 20 (G-20) summit in Japan. News of fresh tariffs imposed on China saw bulls return to the fund Thursday, pushing its price above a downtrend line that extends back to October 2018. Traders who play the breakout should aim to book profits near key resistance at $78 and protect downside with a stop positioned below the 50-day simple moving average (SMA).StockCharts.comDirexion Daily FTSE China Bear 3X Shares (YANG)With net assets of nearly $80 million, the Direxion Daily FTSE China Bear 3X Shares (YANG) aims to provide three times the inverse daily return of the FTSE China 50 Index. The fund's additional leverage makes it a suitable instrument for traders who want an aggressive short-term bet against Chinese equities. With a daily turnover of roughly 355,000 shares and 0.03% spread, YANG offers ample liquidity to fill orders and minimize slippage. Traders should be aware that the ETF rebalances daily, which makes returns longer than one day subject to the effects of compounding. The fund's 1.08% expense ratio sits competitively priced for a geared product. YANG issues a 1.43% dividend yield and is down nearly 25% on the year as of Aug. 2, 2019.YANG shares pulled back sharply in June but managed to hold above the April swing low. The most recent advance started in early July before a period of tight consolidation. Price regained momentum toward the end of last month and has continued its upward thrust into August, rallying above both a nine-month trendline and the 200-day SMA on heavy volume in Thursday's trading session. Traders may decide to scale out at $70 and $77.50 \u2013 both areas of overhead resistance. Consider setting a stop-loss order beneath yesterday's low at $50.28 to protect against a sudden price reversal.StockCharts.comDirexion Daily CSI 300 China A Share Bear 1X Shares (CHAD)The Direxion Daily CSI 300 China A Share Bear 1X Shares (CHAD) attempts to return the inverse daily performance of the CSI 300 Index. This ETF provides U.S. investors with exposure to mainland China-based companies that trade on the two Chinese stock exchanges, the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) \u2013 referred to as China A-shares. Key stocks in the tracked index include Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China, Ltd. (601318.SS), Kweichow Moutai Co., Ltd. (600519.SS), and China Merchants Bank Co., Ltd. (CIHHF). CHAD charges a 0.85% management fee, has roughly $180 million in assets, and carries a YTD return of -23.97% as of Aug. 2, 2019.Like the first two China bear funds discussed, CHAD shares forged a YTD bottom in April. Although price still trades below the May swing high, a 3.60% surge yesterday above the 50-day SMA and a closely watched downtrend line may trigger a bull stampede into this bear ETF as breakout traders enter the fray. The fund may also see buying pressure from traders rushing to cover their short positions. Those who decide to enter should look for a move to the $35 level, where price may encounter resistance from the lower trendline of a previous trading range. Manage risk by cutting losses on a retracement below the downtrend line and moving stops to the breakeven point if the price climbs above the 200-day SMA.",

Photo: VCGA graft crackdown continued rattling the world\u2019s most valuable liquor maker as one more senior executive faces criminal charges.Gao Shouhong, former deputy general manager of Kweichow Moutai Group, was expelled from the Communist Party and removed from public office for serious violations of party discipline and laws, China's top anti-graft watchdog said Thursday afternoon.Gao was removed from the post of Moutai\u2019s deputy general manager in early July as the Guizhou-based company shuffled its top management team in the wake of a graft scandal involving its lucrative retail business.The fall of Gao followed that of Yuan Renguo, former chairman of Moutai who was ousted from the party in May and faces prosecution on corruption charges. Yuan used dealer licenses for Moutai liquor as tools to pull political strings and was involved in exchanges of sex, money and power, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) said in late May.Moutai, which became the world\u2019s most valuable liquor company in 2017, has been at the center of an anti-graft storm since May when investigators targeted Yuan during a probe of Wang Sanyun, former party chief of the southwest province of Gansu, and Wang Xiaoguang, a former vice governor of Guizhou. The company stepped up a reshuffling of its sales network and in July replaced most of its senior executives.Days after Yuan\u2019s downfall, Moutai\u2019s former e-commerce chief Nie Yong was arrested on suspicion of corruption. Nie was suspected of opening brick-and-mortar specialty Moutai stores under his own name, a source told Caixin.The CCDI\u2019s branch in Guizhou, home of Moutai, said Thursday that Gao used his position to gain benefits for others and received huge sums of bribes. He faces prosecution on corruption charges.Gao was disloyal and dishonest to the party and resisted investigation by party authorities, the CCDI said in a statement. He violated party rules by accepting gifts from others and taking illicit equity and positions in business entities. Gao also violated ethical codes and had an appetite for vulgar interests, the graft buster said.Gao was named Moutai\u2019s deputy general manager in 2013 after four years as assistant to the general manager. He was legal representative and senior executive of several Moutai subsidiaries, business registration records showed.Earlier this month, Moutai reported its slowest six-month sales growth in three years as it pivots to a direct-sales strategy to root out graft.Moutai\u2019s Shanghai-listed shares closed at 959.3 yuan per share on Thursday, down 1.37%, making the company\u2019s value 1.21 trillion yuan ($176 billion). The stock reached a record 1,001 yuan June 27 to become China\u2019s first 1,000-yuan stock.Contact reporter Han Wei (weihan@caixin.com)",

            "description": "A bottle of Moutai retails for 2,699 yuan at a supermarket in Shenzhen, in South China's Guangdong province, on June 25. Photo: IC PhotoKweichow Moutai Co. Ltd., the world\u2019s most valuable liquor company, reported its slowest six-month sales growth in three years as it pivots to a direct-sales strategy in a bid to root out graft.According to the company\u2019s financial report released Wednesday, Moutai\u2019s profit grew 26.6% year-on-year to 20 billion yuan ($2.9 billion) in the first half of 2019, while total revenue also rose 18.2% to 39.5 billion yuan.The figures reflect a slowdown compared with the same period last year, when profit grew 40% and revenue grew 38% compared with 2017.In fact, the purveyor of several varieties of premium booze posted the slowest revenue growth across the first six months of any year since 2016, according to Bloomberg.The disappointing sales performance comes as the company is adjusting its distribution channels to eliminate corruption, analysts said in a report by Shanghai-based Orient Securities. Since 2018, Moutai has banned some 536 dealers from selling its flagship liquor \u2014 a quarter of all intermediaries once authorized to do so. Ninety-nine dealers were culled in the first half of 2019 alone, according to the financial report.The significant cut came as Yuan Renguo, Moutai\u2019s chairman from 2011 to 2018, was arrested in May for taking a \u201cmassive\u201d amount of bribes and other \u201csevere violations of discipline and law,\u201d according to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the country\u2019s top disciplinary watchdog.According to the CCDI and several sources close to the company, Yuan handed out lucrative distribution licenses in exchange for favors and bribes from government officials.After Yuan left the company, his successor Li Baofang launched an effort to clean up its dealers. Li said at the annual shareholders meeting in May that the company won\u2019t increase its number of dealers in the future, and will pivot the company\u2019s distribution structure to direct sales.The company has launched a major overhaul to increase the proportion of direct sales and reduce the number of intermediaries it uses. According to Moutai\u2019s 2019 sales plans, 17,000 tons of liquor are assigned to dealer channels, accounting for about 55% of the total sales target, down from about 80% in 2017.Moutai is widely seen as China\u2019s \u201cnational drink,\u201d and demand far outstrips supply, with its long distilling period creating a permanent shortage and high prices.Dealers get the liquor from the factory at a set price of 969 yuan a bottle. Yet the market price tends to be much higher, exceeding 2,000 yuan in the second quarter this year. Analysts expect prices will continue to rise, according to a report by China International Capital Corp.While Moutai\u2019s financial report shows it had already produced 34,400 tons of the base of its flagship liquor in the first half the year \u2014 70% of its annual target \u2014 its production for the whole year is likely to suffer due to a drought a few years ago in its home province, Southwest China\u2019s Guizhou.Moutai\u2019s Shanghai-listed shares closed at 947.5 yuan on Thursday, down 1.66%.David Kirton contributed to the report.This story has been updated to clarify that Moutai produced 34,400 tons of the base of its flagship liquor in the first half of 2019, not 34,400 tons of its flagship liquor.Contact reporter Tang Ziyi (ziyitang@caixin.com)",

The majority of that is now coming from volume growth, which accounted for 1.8 percentage points of growth, with price/mix coming in at 1.4 points.Deal activity was driven by a desire to shift towards fast growth areas and strengthen existing positions. But with lack of mega-deals, merger and acquisition deal value fell 48% from 2017, to $75bn (\u00a360bn).

Ltd. entered the annual Global 50, a list compiled by OC&C Strategy Consultants of the world\u2019s largest 50 fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) businesses by revenue in 2018.\u201cOur research has identified five standout FMCG businesses: Coca Cola, Est\u00e9e Lauder, Yili, Kweichow Moutai and Shiseido that have outperformed their peers,\u201d said Will Hayllar, U.K. managing partner at OC&C, in a statement.\u201cAll five are united in having identified fast growing consumer markets and acted to serve them. Coca Cola and Yili won the health-conscious crowds, Est\u00e9e Lauder and Shiseido won over online millennials, and Kweichow Moutai quenched the Chinese thirst for premium spirits,\u201d Hayllar said.Taking its name from its picturesque hometown of Maotai, the namesake company produces a grain alcohol called \u201cbaijiu\u201d (\u201cwhite wine\u201d in Chinese) and is said to have been the favorite brand of Mao Zedong. The Shanghai-listed firm has retained its title as the world\u2019s largest liquor company since early 2017, when its market capitalization exceeded that of British booze giant Diageo PLC. Its market cap is now around 1.14 trillion yuan ($165 billion).Shares of Moutai reached a record 1,001 yuan in intraday trading in late June, marking China\u2019s equity market\u2019s first 1,000 yuan stock \u2014 though only briefly.Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group Co.

It aims to sell its slew of products \u2014 baby formula, yogurt, liquid milk and ice cream \u2014 to 2 billion consumers at home and abroad by 2020.Now in its 17th year, the Global 50 is compiled based on information extracted from each business\u2019 financial reports.

            "description": "China Tobacco, the world\u2019s largest cigarette-maker, has a bigger market share than the next five global tobacco companies combined. Photo: IC Photo(Bloomberg) \u2014 Investors are embracing Chinese cigarette stocks with the same fervor they typically give to the country\u2019s high-end liquor, but some analysts warn the habit may not be very healthy.China Tobacco International (HK) Co. Ltd. had another wild day in Hong Kong trading on Wednesday as investors scrambled to get a piece of the international unit of state monopoly China National Tobacco Corp. \u2014 the biggest maker of cigarettes in the world. A 44% surge in the morning took the stock\u2019s rally since its initial public offering last month to nearly 500%, before the day\u2019s gains were erased.Even with the afternoon pullback, the company is easily the best-performing IPO in Hong Kong this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Investors have been drawn in because of the scarcity of listed assets in China\u2019s massive cigarette market, prompting comparisons with Kweichow Moutai Co. Ltd., one of the country\u2019s most widely held stocks because of its highly coveted brand of premium baijiu liquor.While some analysts and fund managers say China Tobacco deserves a premium, others warn the stock\u2019s runup is overdone.\u201cThe price surge is ridiculous and it just indicates the crazy and irrational investment behavior,\u201d said Dickie Wong, executive director of research at Kingston Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong. \u201cThe current valuation is far higher than what it deserves. It\u2019s understandable that investors bet on Chinese consumers\u2019 love of tobacco and liquor, but we should still keep a clear mind.\u201dTobacco, like liquor, is a special asset in China, and the connection between the two products is a strong one. They can even be paired as a single word \u2014 \u201cyanjiu\u201d \u2014 to generally describe expensive gifts, as high-end cigarettes and alcohol are often given to business partners or government officials during holidays or to seek favors.But while investors have had access to the popular baijiu market through Moutai \u2014 which last week became the first stock in China to touch 1,000 yuan ($145) a share \u2014 access to the cigarette maker was off limits until its listing in Hong Kong.China Tobacco is up 293% from its IPO price of HK$4.88 ($0.63). The advance since its June 12 debut includes a surge of 41% the following day and a 52% rally this Tuesday. The stock closed with a 3.4% decline to HK$19.18 on Wednesday.L\u00fc Changshun, a fund manager at Beijing Dajun Zhimeng Investment Management Co. Ltd., says China Tobacco\u2019s rally can be justified. \u201cI think most of the moves now are speculation, but I wouldn\u2019t say they are completely irrational\u201d for a unique listed asset like this, he said.Others find the company\u2019s valuation more problematic. At its intraday high, the stock was trading at 33 times book value. Moutai, meanwhile, has a price to book value of about 10.\u201cI\u2019m not quite sure how we should properly value the stock \u2014 there are no comparable firms for reference,\u201d said Liang Jinxin, a Shanghai-based strategist with Tianfeng Securities Co. Ltd. \u201cPricing the stock at 30 more times its book value is too much. It\u2019s inflated.\"The stock doesn\u2019t give full access to China\u2019s cigarette market. China Tobacco International accounts for a tiny portion of China Tobacco\u2019s overall business, which has a bigger market share than the next five global tobacco companies combined. The unit is primarily responsible for procuring overseas tobacco leaf from countries like Brazil and Canada for the cigarette giant.Investors are piling into the stock even as pressure increases on the government to curb smoking. China is the largest tobacco-consuming and -manufacturing country in the world, and critics contend the government isn\u2019t doing enough to prevent the spread of smoking. Around 3,000 people die every day in China due to tobacco use, according to the World Health Organization.Contact reporter Yang Ge (geyang@caixin.com)",

            "description": "Par Sophie RollandPubli\u00e9 le 26 juin 2019 \u00e0 6:03La temp\u00eate boursi\u00e8re du dernier trimestre 2018 a fait retomber les chiffres de cr\u00e9ation de valeur des entreprises autour de leurs moyennes historiques. C'est ce que r\u00e9v\u00e8le le 21e classement du Boston Consulting Group sur le sujet. Ce palmar\u00e8s classe les entreprises en fonction de leur TSR (\u00ab Total Shareholder Return \u00bb) annuel, autrement dit du rendement global pour l'actionnaire. Lequel, calcul\u00e9 sur 5 ans, tient compte \u00e0 la fois des plus-values et des dividendes.Le cru 2013-2017 , li\u00e9 \u00e0 une p\u00e9riode de hausse ininterrompue des march\u00e9s, \u00e9tait bien exceptionnel. Apr\u00e8s \u00eatre mont\u00e9 \u00e0 49 %, le TSR moyen des 10 premi\u00e8res soci\u00e9t\u00e9s est retomb\u00e9 \u00e0 35 % pour la p\u00e9riode 2014-2018, \u00e9tudi\u00e9e dans ce nouveau classement. \u00ab Nous calculons la cr\u00e9ation de valeur des entreprises sur cinq ans afin de nous extraire des contingences et de capturer au mieux, les cons\u00e9quences des strat\u00e9gies \u00e0 long terme \u00bb, pr\u00e9cise J\u00e9r\u00f4me Herv\u00e9 au Boston Consulting Group.La palme revient une nouvelle fois \u00e0 Nvidia , avec un TSR annuel moyen de 54,4 % (76,1 % l'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re). \u00ab Ces sp\u00e9cialistes de l'intelligence artificielle mettent d\u00e9sormais leur technologie au service du d\u00e9veloppement des v\u00e9hicules autonomes. Ils capturent v\u00e9ritablement les tendances. \u00bb Suivent Kweichow Moutai - une entreprise cot\u00e9e \u00e0 Shanghai qui produit le Moutai, une eau-de-vie de luxe pris\u00e9e des \u00e9lites chinoises -, Broadcom et Netflix.100 milliards de capitalisation en plus chaque ann\u00e9e\u00ab Malgr\u00e9 la sortie du classement de Facebook, Keyence et Sony, les entreprises du secteur de la tech et des m\u00e9dias continuent de dominer le classement avec six entreprises dans le Top 10 mondial. \u00bb Outre Nvidia, Broadcom et Netflix qui font preuve d'une certaine long\u00e9vit\u00e9 - c'est leur troisi\u00e8me ann\u00e9e cons\u00e9cutive dans le Top 10 -, Adobe System remonte de la 9e \u00e0 la 5e place, Amazon passe de la 8e \u00e0 la 6e, et Tencent descend de quatre crans, \u00e0 la 8e place. \u00ab Le cas Amazon est impressionnant : le groupe augmente sa capitalisation de quasiment 100 milliards d'euros chaque ann\u00e9e. \u00bbCe que cela signifie concr\u00e8tement pour un actionnaire qui aurait mis\u00e9 sur ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s il y a cinq ans ? Simplement qu'avec Nvidia, il aurait r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 8,7 fois sa mise, avec Broadcom ou Netflix 5 fois et avec Adobe et Amazon un peu moins de 4 fois.\u00ab Deux grandes tendances tirent la cr\u00e9ation de valeur dans le monde : l'innovation technologique, qui est principalement le fait des entreprises am\u00e9ricaines, et la croissance des pays asiatiques \u00bb, poursuit l'expert du BCG. Le classement consacre la domination des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s am\u00e9ricaines - elles sont 7 dans le Top 10 - mais illustre la mont\u00e9e en puissance des groupes asiatiques. La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 chinoise de liqueurs Kweichow Moutai est pass\u00e9e de la 10e \u00e0 la 2e place (avec un TSR de 43,5 % soit 6,2 fois la mise).Perc\u00e9e de l'AsieMais surtout, ces groupes repr\u00e9sentent d\u00e9sormais 55 % des 100 soci\u00e9t\u00e9s qui ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 le plus de valeurs pour l'actionnaire ces cinq derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es. Les classements sectoriels illustrent eux aussi la perc\u00e9e de l'Asie. \u00ab En d'autres termes, les entreprises asiatiques b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient d'un effet de rattrapage et, dans certains cas, d\u00e9passent leurs concurrentes am\u00e9ricaines en mati\u00e8re de cr\u00e9ation de valeur. \u00bbA l'inverse, \u00ab l'Europe reste \u00e0 l'\u00e9cart des tendances porteuses \u00bb, d\u00e9plore J\u00e9r\u00f4me Herv\u00e9. A quelques exceptions pr\u00e8s. En France, neuf entreprises (Thal\u00e8s, Ipsen, Ubisoft Entertainment, Rubis, Trigano, Kering, LVMH, Orange, Peugeot) apparaissent tout de m\u00eame dans les Tops 10 mondiaux par secteur (contre huit en 2017 et deux en 2008). \u00ab Le cas de Safran est \u00e9galement remarquable car peu d'entreprises sont aussi r\u00e9guli\u00e8res en mati\u00e8re de cr\u00e9ation de valeur. \u00bb Sur 2.200 entreprises \u00e9tudi\u00e9es, seules quatre, Safran , Asian Paints, Terna et Toronto-Dominion Bank, ont r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 battre la moyenne de leur secteur sur dix ann\u00e9es cons\u00e9cutives.",

Any such interaction that goes unreported will be subject to investigation, according to a notice published by the CCDI\u2019s local office in the company\u2019s home province of Guizhou, in southwest China.Taking its name from its picturesque hometown of Maotai, the company produces a grain alcohol called \u201cbaijiu\u201d and is said to have been the favorite brand of Mao Zedong. The Shanghai-listed firm has retained its title as the world\u2019s largest liquor company since early 2017, when its market value exceeded that of British booze giant Diageo PLC. Its market cap is 1.14 trillion yuan ($165 billion).Moutai sells to designated distributors at an official factory price of 969 yuan. Yet the market price tends to be much higher, exceeding 2,100 yuan in the first quarter of this year.Yuan is thought to have sold distribution licenses to public officials for private gain. Yet according to several company insiders and members of industry body the China Alcoholic Drinks Association who spoke to Caixin, it has become an open secret that officials from across all level of government would call on senior figures in the company, develop favorable relationships \u2014 often through bribes \u2014 and set up as distributors. The new rules are an effort to address this.License to print moneyAccording to the CCDI and several sources close to the company, Yuan handed out lucrative distribution licenses in exchange for favors and bribes from government officials.Such licenses come with a relatively high upfront cost of between 10 million yuan to 20 million yuan when obtained by legal means, company insiders say. But the returns are high, as Moutai typically sells for twice its official factory price.Distribution quotas are tightly controlled, with retailers obtaining permission to sell a certain quantity of the liquor that is measured in tons, a senior figure at the company told Caixin. \u201cGenerally, dealers start with single digits after obtaining qualifications, such as two tons and five tons per year. Only when they are well managed will they slowly rise up,\u201d he added.Yet distributors soon make their money back, as Moutai typically sells for around 4 million yuan to 5 million yuan per ton. \u201cDistributors who start with a quota of two or three tons will make back the license fee in a year or two, and after that they can just sit back and watch money come in,\u201d the head of a small-scale liquor business in Maotai town said.Drunk on powerYuan\u2019s arrest is thought to center on his relationship with Wang Xiaoguang, the former vice-governor of Guizhou who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for graft in April, and Wang Sanyun, the former secretary of Gansu province, who received 12 years the same month. It is possible Yuan was exposed by investigations into wider crimes by the pair.According to several industry insiders in Maotai town, Yuan specially approved several Moutai distribution businesses for Wang Xiaoguang and gave him several separate quotas covering the businesses. Unlike distributors who have a quota of two to five tons a year, Wang started with 100 tons directly, one insider said. It was thought that he did not even need to buy from the distillery, but received this quantity as gifts, with enough to support several stores, a person in charge of a small liquor company in Maotai said.Several sources told Caixin that Yuan had indulged in such behavior for several years before finally being investigated in relation to Wang Xiaoguang and Wang Sanyun. \u201cAfter these specific cases, we have to ask, who [else] gave him bribes?\u201d one said. \u201cThere can\u2019t just be one briber. Now Wang Xiaoguang and Wang Sanyun are removed, Yuan needs to be thoroughly investigated.\u201dYuan is just one of several Moutai senior figures to have been arrested for corruption in recent years. Former general manager Qiao Hong was arrested for corruption in 2007. In 2014, deputy secretary Fang Guoxing was arrested for managing several illicit distribution companies registered in the names of his family members, while deputy general manager Tan Dinghua was arrested in 2016 after receiving 34.6 million yuan in property in exchange for helping more than 10 companies become distributors.Stopping the rotAfter Yuan left the company, his successor Li Baofang launched an effort to clean up its dealers. Last year, Moutai severed ties with more than 600 of its dealers, the company said in its annual financial report in March.The new registration system \u2014 including the recording of communications with government at all levels \u2014 is an effort to make sure dealings with distributors stay above board.Yet more than one person close to the company said Moutai\u2019s internal investigations found more illegal distribution deals than it is willing to make public. The company \u201ccan\u2019t move, and doesn\u2019t dare move,\u201d the source said.Many major dealers have strong political support, a long-time employee told Caixin. \u201cMany provincial agents and municipal distributors have high-level backgrounds, such as central officials, senior military officers, or are relatives and friends of provincial leaders. Even if these people have all kinds of irregularities in their business, Moutai can't take action against them,\u201d he added.Contact reporter David Kirton (davidkirton@caixin.com)",

            "description": "The former e-commerce chief of renowned liquor-maker Kweichow Moutai Co. Ltd., also the world\u2019s most valuable spirit-maker, has been arrested on suspicion of corruption, just days after the company\u2019s former chairman was charged over similar allegations.The arrests are the latest in a long-running stream dating back six years targeting corrupt officials at government agencies and state-owned enterprises. Big-name companies like Moutai are particularly fertile ground for such corruption, since the company\u2019s liquors are often in short supply and thus can command big premiums beyond their suggested retail prices.Nie Yong, former chairman of Moutai\u2019s e-commerce division, was being investigated for corruption, according to an announcement late Friday on a WeChat public account associated with the city of Tongren in Southwest China\u2019s Guizhou, the same province where Moutai is based. It added the case would be handled in accordance to the law after completion of the probe.The same day of the announcement, Nie was arrested on suspicion of corruption by police in Tongren\u2019s Wanshan district. Nie is suspected of opening brick-and-mortar specialty Moutai stores under his own name, a senior source close to the company told Caixin, detailing one allegation against him.Nie was dismissed from his post last November, at which time the company pointed to a number of issues with the e-commerce division. Those included insufficient mechanisms to protect good corporate governance, mixing of employees\u2019 internal and external affairs leading to loss of benefits to the company, leaking of corporate information and lax and disorderly management. The list also included violations of discipline and regulations, including possible illegal practices \u2014 terminology often used to describe corruption.Announcement of his arrest came just days after word emerged that the company\u2019s former chairman Yuan Renguo was being investigated for accepting massive bribes.Moutai opened an e-commerce channel as early as 2010 offering a sampling of its products online. Business was slow initially, but began gaining traction four years later when Moutai set up a formal e-commerce company which carried a wider range of its products. Around the same time it also began offering its products on popular third-party platforms such as JD.com and Alibaba\u2019s Tmall.Nie was promoted to head the unit in 2016 after previously being a vice manager. That same year the e-commerce unit had more than 4.6 billion yuan ($667 million) in transaction volume, approaching 10% of company\u2019s total sales.Moutai set up the unit for several reasons, including boosting profits by cutting out middlemen and to get more information on its customers. But one of the most important was to get a handle on its retail prices in a country where its well-known and sometimes scarce products are often the subject of rampant profiteering. For example, a 500 milliliter (16.9 fluid ounces) bottle of its Feitian Moutai liquor carries a suggested retail price of 1,499 yuan, far below the 1,800 yuan to 2,100 yuan consumers often paid at many retailers.Moutai\u2019s stock was formerly a major highflyer due to its strong reputation as China\u2019s premier liquor-maker. But the froth has come off its shares since Yuan and now Nie have been formally arrested and their offenses detailed. Over the last five weeks the shares have lost about 10% of their value, wiping out more than $17 billion in market value.Contact reporter Yang Ge (geyang@caixin.com)",

In 1972, ahead of the first historic summit between the United States and the People\u2019s Republic of China, Richard Nixon\u2019s chief of staff, Alexander Haig, went so far as to send a breathless cable through to the White House warning that \u201cunder no \u2013 repeat no \u2013 circumstances should the president actually drink from his glass in response to banquet toasts\u201d.If you\u2019ve never had baijiu, don\u2019t let the squeamishness of a few Westerners discourage you. Better to keep in mind the millions of Chinese whose deeply held affection for the drink has made it the most popular spirit in the world \u2013 by a wide margin.US president Richard Nixon (left) toasts Chinese premier Zhou Enlai during the former\u2019s 1972 visit to Beijing. Photo: AFPNevertheless, it is undeniable that the drink can be an acquired taste, and at least in the US, a difficult sell. No one knows this better than the five siblings who are the proprietors of America\u2019s only baijiu distillery.\u201cHad we known what we were getting ourselves into ...\u201d says one of the five, Michelle Ly, ruefully, as we speak in the sleek, modern tasting room of the Vinn Distillery bottle shop, in Portland, Oregon. \u201cI think it was a fortunate thing that we were ignorant to how much Americans weren\u2019t ready for baijiu. It was only after we went out and tried to sell it that we realised: \u2018Oh my gosh, this is the hardest stuff to sell!\u2019\u201dLy doesn\u2019t blame the consumer, either; the problem, she says, is unfamiliarity. It\u2019s not that most people haven\u2019t tried baijiu \u2013 though most haven\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s that most have never tasted anything like it.\u201cWhen your taste buds aren\u2019t familiar with that flavour profile you just kind of reject it,\u201d says Ly. \u201cWith baijiu you have to have an open mind.\u201dThe difference is not just cultural; baijiu is unusual, too, in the way that it\u2019s made. It is one of the rare spirits created through parallel fermentation. Most alcohol is produced in two discrete steps; first a grain is soaked in water, or malted, which converts its starches into sugars, and then it is fermented: the process by which those sugars become alcohol. For millennia, baijiu manufacturers have \u2013 in the most basic terms \u2013 carried out both processes at once. The grain \u2013 for Vinn Distillery and many baijiu distilleries in southern China, that would be rice \u2013 is cooked and then combined with the fermentation starter, called the qu, a mix of rice flour and a secret family recipe of herbs and spices. The mixture is left to ferment for six months before being transferred to a pot still, where it will age for at least another year. Parallel fermentation is responsible for baijiu\u2019s funky flavour \u2013 and its notoriously high alcohol content, another aspect Americans struggle with.We\u2019ve always distilled baijiu in our family [...] When we came to the United States, we still had to honour our ancestors and welcome the New Year [...] So, we distilled our own baijiu in the backyard. Unbeknown to us, that was illegal Michelle Ly\u201cFor our flagship product, we made one at 80 proof, which is more in line with a vodka, whereas traditionally in China you would drink it at 100 to 120 proof,\u201d says Ly. \u201cWe\u2019ve created another product, called the Baijiu Family Reserve, which is 106 proof, more in line with traditional baijiu.\u201dIn China, distillers turn out more than 10 million litres per year. The largest baijiu brand, Kweichow Moutai , is today the most valuable beverage company in history, dwarfing well-known conglomerates such as Diageo and Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton. Anyone who has spent time in China will know that baijiu is often the most affordable intoxicant while, at the other end of the spectrum, some bottles can fetch prices that put even fine wines and whiskies to shame.A bottle of Vinn\u2019s flagship spirit can be bought for less than US$30 but just because it\u2019s affordable and made in America doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not authentic.\u201cWe\u2019ve always distilled baijiu in our family,\u201d says Ly. \u201cBaijiu is used in ancestor offerings and in every celebra\u00adtion. When we came to the United States, we still had to honour our ancestors and welcome the New Year. We cooked with it, we made medicine with it. So, we distilled our own baijiu in the backyard. Unbeknown to us, that was illegal.\u201cWe thought it was OK because it was our tradition. It\u2019s what we\u2019d always done.\u201dPhan Ly and Kim Trinh, with their five children (from left) Lien, Vicki, Michelle, Quyen and Quan, in front of their first house in Wilsonville, in 1980. Photo: Vinn DistilleryThe Ly family has been making baijiu for at least six generations. For as long as anyone can remember, their ancestors were known as master distillers, much appreciated in the village near Ha Long Bay, in northern Vietnam, in which the five siblings now running the Vinn Distillery were born.\u201cAs children, we all knew the steps of the distilling pro\u00adcess. Whenever they made rice for fermenting, we would help add the qu and stick it into little buckets. And we\u2019d have to tend the fire for the still,\u201d Ly recalls. \u201cWe\u2019d do these little bits and pieces, we never did the whole process.\u201dIn 1978, when the siblings were still very young, their world turned upside down. Caught up in a wave of deportations of ethnic Chinese, the Lys were sent to a village in China\u2019s Guangdong province, which Michelle Ly identifies as Boluo.\u201cIt was an orange-farming village,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a community where the people who worked in the field would come back to warm cooked food in a cafeteria-like facility. It wasn\u2019t bad living at all. There was definitely a strong sense of community.\u201dPot stills in the Vinn Distillery.

Food, water and tea were provided three times a day. We were not allowed to leave that [building] during that month. After a month, we moved to another refugee camp, where we were allowed to roam the city to look for jobs,\u201d says Ly.\u201cWe shared a room with two other families. There were queen and twin bunk beds that were stacked three beds high. Because we didn\u2019t know any better, we felt like that was normal. We had shared bathrooms and we had a portable stove for cooking on the balcony.\u201dTwo of the Ly siblings, Vicki (left) and Michelle.

We were so lucky.\u201cWe landed here in Portland in November 1979, I had just turned seven. My sister Vicki had just turned five. None of us spoke English. I only knew A, B and C. The community acclimated us to society. They taught us words like \u2018floor\u2019 and \u2018ceiling\u2019 and \u2018door\u2019. They taught us how to use the stove, they taught us how bathrooms and toilets and showers worked. It was all so foreign to us.\u201dLike so many other Chinese immigrants, the Lys began to make a living in the restaurant business. All along their father distilled baijiu.\u201cAs a kid, we had to drink alcohol. [Their parents] would only give us a small amount, not enough to get buzzed or drunk; just enough to make our \u2018blood flow better\u2019. They weren\u2019t picky about what we drank, we just had to drink alcohol. It tasted awful to us so we would cry when we did have to drink it,\u201d Ly recalls. \u201cBut as we got older, we learned to appreciate it.\u201dBaijiu rice is fermented in buckets for six months. Photo: Jordan HughesThe restaurant, Wok Inn, in Wilsonville, was a family affair, with every sibling lending a hand.\u201cIt was an open kitchen buffet style where you picked out your vegetables and meat and the chef would cook it in a wok,\u201d says Ly. \u201cHaving a Chinese restaurant and a bar, customers would always ask, \u2018Do you have any Chinese liquor?\u2019 We\u2019d have to say, \u2018We have Qingdao [beer],\u2019 and that was it.\u201dPhan\u2019s frustration at not being able to give his customers what they wanted planted the seed that would become the Vinn Distillery. Phan had put his all into the restaurant but 20 years of the stresses and strains of the industry were getting to him. A doctor told him he should retire.Not one to stay idle, though, Phan spent his new free time out behind the house, tending the still in the garden.\u201cDad said, \u2018I\u2019m going to make baijiu and bring it to market,\u2019\u201d Ly remembers, \u201cand we were like, \u2018Sure! Enjoy your retirement!\u2019\u201dFor the doubting family, the paperwork involved in becoming a distiller of anything seemed daunting enough, but to become the one and only baijiu producer in the US was close to unimaginable. Meanwhile, though, work in the restaurant without their father by their side was becoming ever more laborious for the siblings.We were very new to the market; we didn\u2019t understand the industry. You know how wine connoisseurs really understand the nuance of wine, the flavours? We didn\u2019t understand that at all. We just drank Michelle LySuddenly, thanks to Phan, there was an alternative. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think he\u2019d actually do it,\u201d says Ly. \u201cBut 3\u00bd years later, he had everything done.\u201dIn March 2009, Phan announced he had been awarded his distiller\u2019s licence and told his children to close the restaurant. He needed them to work with him, bringing his impossible vision to fruition. They would sell America on baijiu.Their father wanted to name the new company Five Siblings but they preferred Vinn Distillery, which is derived from the family\u2019s middle name.\u201cWe were very new to the market; we didn\u2019t understand the industry,\u201d says Ly, of the early days. \u201cYou know how wine connoisseurs really understand the nuance of wine, the flavours? We didn\u2019t understand that at all. We just drank.\u201dHad they known what they would be up against in try\u00ading to get Americans to drink baijiu they may have quit before they even got started. Luckily, and unbeknown to the Lys, they had two things going for them: time and place.Phan Ly and wife Kim Trinh in 2011, amid vats of fermenting rice in the Vinn Distillery, Portland, Oregon, in the United States. Photo: Vinn DistilleryAmerican drinkers are now more open-minded and adventurous than ever before, craving flavours that even a decade ago would have been considered too intense: puckeringly bitter ales, sour beers, herbaceous amaros, high-proof spirits and funky small-batch natural wines. If there were ever a time for baijiu to gain traction with the American drinking public, this was it. And if there were ever a place, it was their adopted hometown.\u201cPortland is known around the world for its indepen\u00addent makers and artisans,\u201d claims Portland Made, a brand that gathers together the small-scale manufacturers of bags and balms, suits and ceramics. While even in major cities in America, small-batch distilling is relatively rare, Portland \u2013 a city of less than 700,000 people \u2013 has an entire district dedicated to the practice, Distillery Row, where the Vinn facilities are located. The ethos of supporting local endeavour and small businesses trickles down from the city government to the consumer.\u201cWe\u2019re very much craft-oriented here in the Northwest,\u201d says Ly. \u201cIt\u2019s the mentality; support the locals, try some\u00adthing new. Portland liquor stores are more willing to take local product over the big national brands and that\u2019s helped us a lot. The community as well, they\u2019re all willing to try something new.\u201cThe past 10 years have been like that for us.\u201dVicki Ly corrects her sister, \u201cActually, our whole lives have been like that. We had just the clothes on our backs when the church took us in. We\u2019ve had a lot of kind people in our lives.\u201dVinn Distillery vats. Photo: Jordan HughesWhen the siblings\u2019 father died, in 2012, there was never any doubt the new family business would continue. The Baijiu Family Reserve was created in Phan\u2019s honour, in his preferred strength, in the traditional-style bottle he favour\u00aded. And that product quickly became Vinn\u2019s biggest seller.\u201cThat\u2019s partially why we\u2019re still out here promoting and pushing it, because it\u2019s his legacy,\u201d says Michelle.Today, all the siblings \u2013 except youngest brother, Quan, who has decamped to Toronto, Canada, but still helps out when he\u2019s at home \u2013 and their mother do their part in running the business, with Michelle handling sales and marketing, Vicki accounts. The oldest, Lien, has taken over from her father as distiller and is in charge of overall production. Second-oldest Quyen oversees general oper\u00adations. \u201cWe do have specific tasks we primarily oversee but we all pitch in and do whatever we need to get a job done, so technically, we all do a bit of everything,\u201d Michelle says.All own an equal share in the company and the siblings have hired three employees to help with running the tasting room, sales and events.As the family\u2019s expertise has grown so has their product line. Today, the Vinn Distillery offers nine products, including baijius infused with honey and berries, and even a barrel-aged baijiu whiskey, something unheard of in China but proving popular with US drinkers.\u201cWe still produce in very small quantity and the volume depends on the demand and if there are orders we need to fulfil,\u201d says Michelle, adding that Vinn products can be found in stores in five states.Vinn Distillery's barrel-aged baijiu whiskey. Photo: Jordan HughesThe days of choking down the \u201cmedicine\u201d are long gone. Vicki has become known among family and friends for her watermelon baijiu margaritas \u2013 though she says she prefers a baijiu mule cocktail \u201cwith ginger beer and a lime\u201d. And Michelle has developed a fondness for baijiu bloody Marys. Though both sisters agree that if they\u2019re \u201cfeeling lazy\u201d, they just \u201cpour it in a glass and drink it straight\u201d.While the Lys are undoubtedly America\u2019s baijiu pioneers, \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see a lot more brands out there that are trying to break into the market,\u201d says Michelle, with a certain pride.Ming River, a baijiumade in Sichuan province but branded for US consumers, is finding a foothold in the country and appears on an increasing number of bar menus. And an ever-booming population of affluent migrants to the US means that even if many American customers are slow to warm to baijiu\u2019s charms, Chinese drinkers can be found in sufficient numbers to compensate.\u201cThere are moments when we\u2019re so excited and people are embracing it and then moments of, \u2018Oh my gosh, how are we going to keep the lights on,\u201d says Michelle. \u201cAt festivals and events, we ask people, and to this day I\u2019d say in the high 80s per cent still don\u2019t know what baijiu even is.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d chimes in Vicki. \u201cBut we\u2019re still alive.\u201d",

            "description": "Moutai\u2019s namesake liquor, known as China\u2019s \u201cnational liquor,\u201d is often served at Chinese state banquets and presented as a diplomatic gift. Photo: VCGShares of the most famous Chinese liquor brand plunged almost 12% in three days, slashing the market cap of the world\u2019s most valuable distiller by more than 110 billion yuan ($16 billion), as the company\u2019s move to sell more liquor directly to consumers created a public outcry and drew regulatory scrutiny.Kweichow Moutai Co., the publicly traded maker of Moutai liquor, received a letter from the Shanghai Stock Exchange Tuesday night asking for an explanation of why the state-run parent company, Kweichow Moutai Winery Group, established a direct sales unit. Investors and analysts said they are worried that the move could siphon off profits from the listed company.Kweichow Moutai Group Marketing Co. was formally created May 5 as a wholly owned subsidiary of the parent group to run its own direct-sales network. The parent company said the new sales network would focus on group buyers and retailers and would complement the current nationwide network of dealers.Since the beginning of this year, Moutai has launched a major overhaul to increase the proportion of direct sales and reduce the number of dealers. According to Moutai\u2019s 2019 sales plans, 17,000 tonnes of liquor are assigned to dealer channels, accounting for about 55% of the total sales target, down from about 80% in 2017. In 2018, only about 6% of revenue came from sales at the company\u2019s own stores and on its online retail platform, and the rest came from the dealer network.The parent group controls 62% of the Shenzhen-listed distilling company. The group-owned sales network suggests that at least some of current sales will be transferred from the listed company to the parent group, diverting revenue from the listed company, according to some investors and analysts. Moutai didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Investment bank Bernstein downgraded its rating on Moutai shares Monday to \u201cmarket perform\u201d from \u201coutperform,\u201d slashing its target price to 916 yuan from 1,089 yuan, citing the likelihood that the parent company\u2019s new sales unit might erode Moutai\u2019s revenue and governance. But China International Capital Corp (CICC) upgraded its target price for the stock to 1,250 yuan, saying the stock is undervalued and projecting positive result from the restructuring. The stock closed Tuesday at 884.40 yuan.Several market participants told Caixin that it\u2019s not clear whether the newly formed company will take over some or all of Moutai liquor\u2019s sales channels.Moutai\u2019s namesake liquor, known as China\u2019s \u201cnational liquor,\u201d is often served at Chinese state banquets and presented as a diplomatic gift. Distilled from fermented sorghum and other ingredients, the product is known for its high alcohol content and powerful, complex taste. The liquor is not only popular among consumers, but also coveted by collectors for its potential appreciation.The official retail price for a new, 500-milliliter bottle of Moutai is currently 1,499 yuan ($220). But as the liquor is often in short supply, the actual market price can go over 2,000 yuan a bottle. A 2017 bottle of Moutai\u2019s flagship Feitian with 53 percent alcoholic content now carries a price tag of 2,299 yuan on online shopping platform JD.com.It\u2019s commonly believed older Moutai tastes better. A 1957 bottle of Moutai sold for 2.16 million yuan at an auction last year, setting the record for the most expensive liquor sold.The establishment of the group-owned sales network aims to streamline the sales channels and crack down on abnormal pricing, liquor industry expert Cai Xuefei said. The current huge dealers\u2019 network has led to a short supply of the liquor, he said.In the first quarter this year, the company disqualified 476 dealers, about 20% of the nationwide total, citing violations of sales regulations or ties with Moutai employees or local government. Analysts said they expect the sales quota originally assigned to these dealers to be taken over by the parent-owned unit instead of being distributed to remaining dealers.Dealers get the liquor from the factory for 969 yuan a bottle, but Moutai\u2019s own channels sell it at the official retail price of 1,499 yuan a bottle. This means that every tonne of liquor sales going to direct channels from dealers can contribute about 1.13 million yuan of profits to the listed company.The 476 disqualified dealers originally had an estimated 6,800 tonnes of sales quota, which means the new direct-sales unit could take about 7 billion yuan of profits from the listed company.The parent group recently also took out 600 tonnes of sales quota from the listed company and solicited public bidding from supermarket retailers.Although that amount is not significant, it is intended to test the waters with a clear direction, aiming to find reliable supermarket retailers and large and medium-sized enterprises as customers, according to a research report by China Merchant Securities Co.Contact editor Han Wei (weihan@caixin.com)",

            "description": "The former chairman of Chinese liquor-maker Moutai has been removed from his seats on a key government advisory body, with a source saying that the dismissal may have been related to him abusing his power and messing with the market.Yuan Renguo, the ex-chairman of Kweichow Moutai Co. Ltd., has been dismissed from his position as a standing committee member of the Guizhou Committee of the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).Yuan has also been relieved from two other positions on the committee, according to an official statement (link in Chinese) released Sunday. The statement didn\u2019t offer a reason for Yuan\u2019s dismissal, but Caixin has learned from a source that it may have been related to Yuan abusing his power to designate dealers, leading to an artificial inflation in the price of Moutai liquor during his tenure as chairman from 2011 to 2018.Yuan, 63, was appointed Moutai\u2019s chairman in 2011 after spending more than four decades working for the company. He was elected to the standing committee of the Guizhou Committee of the CPPCC in early 2018, a few months before he stepped down as the company\u2019s chairman in May that year. In China, CPPCC membership usually has political value for executives at state-owned enterprises.He was replaced by Li Baofang, who had only been with Moutai for about three years following a stint working for the government.Based in Southwest China\u2019s Guizhou province, Moutai is one of the country\u2019s most famous brands of a Chinese grain alcohol called \u201cbaijiu.\u201d The Shanghai-listed company has retained its title as the world\u2019s largest liquor company since early 2017, when its market value exceeded that of British whisky giant Diageo PLC.During Yuan\u2019s seven-year tenure as chairman, state-owned Moutai grew rapidly. The company\u2019s revenue rose from 18.4 billion yuan ($4.41 billion) in 2011 to 73.6 billion yuan in 2018.In late 2017, Moutai announced that it would increase factory-gate prices across its line of baijiu products by 9% to 25%, sending its share price rocketing to a record high at the time.Caixin has learned from multiple sources close to the company that Yuan has been adept in forging good relationships with suppliers and dealers. A source familiar with the matter said Yuan used his position to select some as the company\u2019s designated dealers, who then managed to inflate the price of the liquor.After taking over Moutai early last year, Li began an overhaul of the company\u2019s dealership system \u201cunder the order of the Guizhou government,\u201d the sources said.A source familiar to the company\u2019s dealership system told Caixin that four types of dealers were targeted in the crackdown, including those designated by former company executives, and those controlled by company employees.Last, year, Moutai severed ties with more than 600 of its dealers, the company said in its annual financial report in March.Contact reporter Mo Yelin (yelinmo@caixin.com)",

Its success is tied to China\u2019s economy and culture, and a growing pride in the nation. It has also featured extensively in China\u2019s political life.Kweichow Moutai is a maker of baijiu, which translates literally as \u201cwhite liquor\u201d, a sorghum-based spirit long-favoured at business meetings and official banquets. The brand in question has been in operation since 1951, the merger of three distilleries based in the town of Moutai, Guizhou province in southwest China. Its proof is a punchy 53%.Part state-owned and part publicly-traded, it has a close relationship with China\u2019s history. According to the South China Morning Post, Moutai (pre-merger) was served at the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1949. In 1972, premier Zhou Enlai served it to visiting US president Richard Nixon. Henry Kissinger told Deng Xiaoping that \u201cI think if we drink enough Maotai we can solve anything,\u201d the New York Times reported in 2008 , in an article detailing the product\u2019s decline. Things are different now.Oddly, for a brand operating in the super-premium segment of the market, the story of Kweichow Moutai\u2019s recent success is based on graft, or President Xi Jingping\u2019s much-publicised efforts to battle it. Xi ordered the crackdown soon after coming to power in 2012.\u201cFanfu\u201d, as it\u2019s known in Mandarin, hit the elite hard. Communist Party officials had to reduce their travel and cut down on delicacies like shark\u2019s fin, expensive club membership, and ultra-premium booze. Outrageous displays of wealth were suddenly extremely risky.One key brand at the centre of this was Kweichow Moutai, which, according to the Singapore Straits Times , at its peak in 2012, half of its sales came from government-related consumers. Across the baijiu market, an estimated 70% of ultra-premium baijiu was going to either the government or the military. Fanfu had a significant effect on the product\u2019s price, which tumbled to less than half its peak price.Earlier that year, Baijiu had seen a major moment. Diageo, the British multinational drinks company became the controlling stakeholder in the Shuijingfang brand. A rare example of a western company taking control over a Chinese brand. By 2013, sales had dropped by 78%, forcing Diageo to write down the brand\u2019s value by US$446 million. It had focussed too heavily on the collapsing super-premium segment. In 2017, Moutai grew larger than Diageo by market capitalisation.Five years later, analysis from drinks analyst Bernstein shows how the Baijiu market has completely changed . Where government and army officials once accounted for 70% of sales, that proportion plunged to 10%, while individuals began to take 70%, with the remaining 20% being business based. This new affordability has been crucial to burgeoning interest.However, it\u2019s the provenance that has gone a long way in limiting supply and sending demand skywards. According to reporting from the South China Morning Post , the town\u2019s particular microclimate, the locality of the ingredients, and the five-year manufacturing process keeps its core product\u2019s prices high. It is also attracting international interest, with auctioneer Christies publishing a guide to Moutai on its website.One anonymous senior member of the company explained that \u201cpeople\u2019s income has skyrocketed and we will never be able to match the rapidly increasing demand because Maotai is an affordable luxury and a very important piece of the social and business cultures of China.\u201dStyled as the country\u2019s national drink, the company has also started to invest in marketing communications and sponsorship in order to reach new consumers as it further diversifies its consumer base. Witness, for instance, its tie-up with the Italian top-flight football club, Inter Milan.Analysts now expect the company to soon break the 1,000 yuan share price barrier. \u201cI can\u2019t see any growth cap on the company in the long run, unless the Chinese don\u2019t drink one day\u201d, says Dai Ming, a fund manager at Hengshen Asset in Shanghai. \u201cThe liquor culture is deep-rooted in China and when you do business here, you drink. It\u2019s a product with demand outstripping supply, so growth is quite visible.\u201dIts first quarter profits for 2019 rose by 30% year-on-year. It is both a luxury collectors\u2019 item and a growing tipple of the middle classes. It is a unique phenomenon. Looking ahead, its fate requires the company to start selling abroad as well as in China, and it aims to export 10% of its product in future, despite shortages. As long as the supply remains low, demand shows no signs of slowing.South China Morning Post, New York Times, Straits Times, Just-Drinks, YT Sports, WARC",

Und der wertvollste Schnapshersteller der Welt eilt weiter von Rekord zu Rekord.Dan Rather, einer der gro\u00dfen amerikanischen Nachrichtenmoderatoren, beschrieb den Geschmack in den 1970er Jahren \u201ewie fl\u00fcssige Rasierklingen zu trinken\u201c. Dem China-Korrespondenten der F.A.Z., Autor dieser Zeilen, kam es beim wiederkehrenden Umtrunk mit chinesischen Parteikadern hingegen eher so vor, als werde ihm ein mit Rasierklingen besetzter Handschuh ins Gesicht geschlagen.Hendrik Ankenbrand Korrespondent f\u00fcr S\u00fcdostasien, Australien und Neuseeland mit Sitz in Singapur. Folgen Ich folgeDie Rede ist von Maotai, dem f\u00fcr westliche Geschm\u00e4cker vielleicht am wenigsten bek\u00f6mmlichen alkoholischen Getr\u00e4nk der Welt \u2013 und dem wertvollsten. Ein aus Hirse gebrannter Schnaps mit einem Alkoholgehalt von bis zu 70 Volumenprozent, dessen Hersteller Kwaichow Moutai seit 2001 an der B\u00f6rse in Schanghai notiert ist und seitdem denjenigen, der den Titel gehalten hat, reich gemacht hat: \u00fcber 15.000 Prozent Wertzuwachs bis heute.Sie steigt und steigtUm 43 Prozent stieg die Aktie in den vergangenen zw\u00f6lf Monaten, um fast zwei Drittel gewann sie an Wert allein seit Jahresbeginn. Am Mittwoch hat der Schnapsbrenner nun wieder gute Zahlen f\u00fcr das abgelaufene erste Quartal vorgelegt: dem Umsatz um fast ein Viertel auf 21,6 Milliarden Yuan (2,9 Milliarden Euro) gesteigert und damit st\u00e4rker als von den meisten Analysten erhofft. Der Gewinn nach Steuern stieg in dem Zeitraum gar um fast ein Drittel auf 11,2 Milliarden Yuan (1,5 Milliarden Euro). Ergibt eine Gewinnmarge von fast 50 Prozent \u2013 in der vergangenen Dekade lag die Marge sogar im Schnitt um das Doppelte h\u00f6her.Maotai, zuweilen auch Moutai genannt, ist die ber\u00fchmteste Marke des chinesischen Baijiu-Schaps, der aus Hirse und Weizen gebraut wird und der einst von Maos Kampfgenossen Zhou Enlai w\u00e4hrend des Langen Marsches in den alkoholischen Adelsstand erhoben wurde. Heute kostet die billigste Flasche des Herstellers 1499 Yuan oder rund 200 Euro und darf in keinem chinesischen Haushalt fehlen, der etwas auf sich h\u00e4lt.Gebrannt im ArmenhausGebrannt wird der Schnaps in der Stadt Moutai in der s\u00fcdlichen Provinz Guizhou, Chinas Armenhaus, aus dem die Zentralregierung mit Milliarden an Subventionen mit aller Gewalt ein chinesisches Silicon Valley zu formen gedenkt. Amerikanische IT-Unternehmen wie Qualcomm haben der Region jedoch bereits wieder den R\u00fccken gekehrt. Den wahren Erfolg, subventionsfrei und allein durch die schier unersch\u00f6pfliche Nachfrage des Marktes getrieben, bringt allein der Maotai nachhause.2012, als Xi Jinping zum Parteichef aufstieg und sp\u00e4ter auch den Titel des Pr\u00e4sidenten \u00fcbernahm, stand der Maotai schon einmal kurz vor dem Aus. Rund die H\u00e4lfte der Verk\u00e4ufe des s\u00fcndhaft teuren Hirseschnaps entfiel Sch\u00e4tzungen zufolge in dieser Zeit auf die K\u00e4ufe von Parteikadern, die zwar offiziell oft keine 1000 Euro im Monat verdienten, aber \u00fcber geheimnisvolle Wege in der Lage waren, bei ihren Banketten den Maotai reichlich flie\u00dfen zu lassen oder eine oder mehrere Flaschen dem Vorgesetzten als kleine Aufmerksamkeit zu \u00fcberreichen, auf dass es schneller vorangehen solle mit der Karriere.In der Folge von Xis Anti-Korruptionskampagne fiel der Umsatz des Maotai wie ein Stein, der Gewinn stagnierte, der Preis der Aktie sank um die H\u00e4lfte auf 119 Yuan im Fr\u00fchjahr 2014. Dann erlebte der Maotai ein sagenhaftes Comeback. Heute ist ein Anteilsschein von Kwaichow Moutai 965 Yuan wert (129 Euro). Bis der Hirseschnaps als erste chinesische Aktie die Marke von 1000 Yuan durchbrechen wird, d\u00fcrfte es nicht mehr lange dauern \u2013 bis zum Jahresende will der Hersteller seine j\u00e4hrliche Produktionsmenge von 48.000 auf 56.000 Tonnen steigern."

Situated adjacent to the fossilized panda bones was a human skeleton, according to Global Times.The team that made the discoveries was composed of experts from China and Europe, and was the 21st expedition into the 257.4-kilometer-long cave.According to a CCTV report, the subterranean tunnels have previously yielded giant panda remains: an expedition in 2016 reportedly discovered numerous fossils from ancient pandas. In addition to panda fossils, according to a China Daily report from 2016, researchers also found fossilized bear and elephant bones.It is believed the vertebrate remains were washed into the cave and deposited were water flow was slow. Over time, the bones became fossils.One of the most interesting discoveries to come out of the recently concluded survey of Shuanghe cave is the fact the cave is at least 257.4 kilometers long \u2013 18.9 kilometers longer than the measurement from 2018. The cave is now recognized as the world\u2019s fifth longest cave.Discovered in the late 1980s, the cave has \u2018grown\u2019 considerably since its discovery.

Arrivo camminando dalla rua do Regedor, tra banchi di carne dolce, pinne di squalo, pasticcini al sesamo, pasteis de nata e palazzi portoghesi ridipinti con murales simili a fumetti manga. Per orientarsi a Macao, la ex-colonia che oggi fa da anticamera alla Cina popolare, bisogna sospendere la reazione estetica che ovunque vede il kitsch \u2013 perch\u00e9 il pupazzo di un teletubbie fa da usciere all\u2019antico Palazzo del Governo? \u2013, bisogna rinnegare distinzioni di valore tutte europee tra passato e presente, imparare a vedere l\u2019armonia tra un tempio confuciano fumante d\u2019incenso e un grattacielo a forma di corona di piume. Insomma bisogna disorientarsi, e poi si \u00e8 pronti per entrare nei casin\u00f2, tra i capitelli di marmo, i soffitti affrescati, le statue di giada, i ristoranti e i tavoli da gioco, che producono e consumano sogni a ciclo ininterrotto come enormi cervelli addormentati.\u201cUn paesaggio di desideri realizzati, e quindi di disciplinata follia\u201d: cos\u00ec Lawrence Osborne definisce questi interni nel suo La ballata di un piccolo giocatore (2014), un libro perfetto e abbagliante, che da mesi oscura qualsiasi altra narrazione mi capiti di leggere, ed \u00e8 anche una delle guide in questo mio viaggio dalla Cina a Bangkok, al cui termine cercher\u00f2 d\u2019incontrare l\u2019autore.Nel romanzo di Osborne, Macao gira intorno a un inglese di mezza et\u00e0, letteralmente scappato dall\u2019Europa e venuto qui a spendere i suoi soldi rubati. Indossa abiti eleganti, gioca con \u201cguanti gialli di capretto\u201d e si fa chiamare Lord Doyle. Macao gli appare come \u201cun mondo fatto per noi fantasmi allucinati, noi ombre affamate, straniere, sfinite\u201d, dove il \u201cnoi\u201d si riferisce agli occidentali \u2013 in cantonese gwai lo, stranieri, ma letteralmente: \u201cuomini fantasma\u201d \u2013 che vengono qui a cercare un\u2019altra vita, figure esemplari di smarrimento globale e nostalgia di un benessere perduto.In questo articolo parliamo di: Libri Lawrence Osborne , La ballata di un piccolo giocatore, Adelphi, 2018.

Uno di loro fuma un enorme sigaro; la scatola di avana in omaggio e\u0300 aperta sul tavolo. Scrolla la cenere in una conchiglia di metallo che richiama le riproduzioni dozzinali del Botticelli incassate nelle pareti azzurre. Le mani iniziano a sudarmi nei guanti che indosso sempre nelle sale da gioco.

Era avvocato, figlio di un distributore di aspirapolveri, e ha messo fine a questa vita derubando una vedova con un raggiro. Si ritrova solo e ricercato per scappare da quella che descrive come una condizione di prigionia: \u201cMacao non poteva essere peggio, riflettei, del carcere dove gia\u0300 vivevo\u201d.Sfilando tra le sale del Lisboa scatto delle foto e presto vengo circondato dal personale che mi copre l\u2019obiettivo. Si tratta certo della privacy dei giocatori che vengono qui dalla Cina popolare. I loro volti m\u2019ipnotizzano: stravaccati, abulici, distratti. Intorno ai tavoli per le puntate forti gli spettatori \u2013 occidentali in felpa e giovani cinesi in tiro, anche loro tutt\u2019altro che eccitati \u2013 fissano i volti tristi dei giocatori che piazzano le fiches. Assisto a una puntata da 10.000 dollari di Hong Kong. Il croupier impassibile scopre le carte, ritira a s\u00e9 le fiches e indica col palmo aperto il tavolo per le giocate, guardando altrove. Di nuovo mi raggiungono quelli della sicurezza: \u201cno photo\u201d. Comincia una specie di inseguimento sulle scale mobili, alla fine mi controllano le foto, fingo di cancellare, guardo le telecamere onnipresenti e mi chiedo se sapranno dell\u2019intruso negli altri casin\u00f2.Doyle alza le puntate e la direzione gli manda un comitato di benvenuto, e lui ordina acqua con ghiaccio, mentre crede di ricordare qualcosa del suo passato osservando i falsi dipinti d\u2019epoca.Nell\u2019attesa guardai i quadri equestri inglesi alle pareti e gli alari del camino. Mi ricordarono una stanza vera che avevo visto in Inghilterra: una sala di una grande dimora di campagna in cui ero stato una volta, forse una dimora famosa. Mi sforzai di riconoscere quelle lunghe facce aquiline di nobili morti da un pezzo, con lineamenti europoidi impercettibilmente distorti da falsari che ne avevano poca dimestichezza. Poteva esserci quella del vero Lord Doyle, per quel che ne sapevo. Mi chiesi se esisteva davvero, o se tanti anni prima avevo scelto il mio nome macaense grazie a una fortunata ispirazione. Mi pareva, in realta\u0300, di averlo letto su un giornale; doveva essersi fissato nel mio inconscio. O forse ero stato in una casa dove era stato menzionato o raffigurato un Lord Doyle. Non me lo ricordavo piu\u0300.Uno dei leit motiv della Ballata \u2013 come di altri romanzi di Osborne \u2013 \u00e8 l\u2019accurata descrizione dell\u2019appetito e dei pasti del protagonista. Il tema torna in modo insistente, smisurato, grottesco, finch\u00e9 non risuona come un drammatico tema del destino. I pasti iniziano al famoso ristorante Galera, dove Doyle ordina \u201cuna bottiglia di Kweichow Moutai del \u201927, un liquore di sorgo che dicono sia la bevanda cinese piu\u0300 cara mai prodotta. Costava 47.500 dollari di Hong Kong\u201d. Lo consuma con tortini di granchi gialli e verdi.Dopo un po\u2019 apparve una zuppa di funghi, in cui si combinavano mandorle, frutti di bosco, fiori di ginestrone viola e pezzetti di timo fiorito. Sul soffitto apparvero le stelle \u2013 luccicavano come nel cielo notturno \u2013 e bevvi allegramente, poi rimasi a pensare davanti a un caffe\u0300 lungo con dolcetti.Nei pasti di Doyle a Macao, per lo pi\u00f9 notturni come quelli di un vampiro, vedremo susseguirsi: bacalhau assado innaffiato di Periquita; ostriche, anelli di cipolla, dim sum a base di frutti di mare, sardine, grappa e cre\u0300me-caramel; t\u00e8 oolong con biscotti allo zenzero, pancakes con frutta e yogurt; ricci con vino di riso; bistecche, noodles tirati con il bambu\u0300, pollo al sale hakka, pancia di maiale con verdure, anatra ripiena di riso, linguine alle vongole; tofu ngiong, fettine di maiale con senape indiana, capesante e anatra all\u2019arancia. L\u2019acme di questa serie culinaria \u00e8 la proposta di un ricco giocatore che gli propone di provare il pangolino, \u201cfritto o bollito con salsa di prugne\u201d.A proposito di questi pasti, a un certo punto Doyle si ricorda del lusso che mensilmente i genitori si concedevano in un ristorante francese. Il suo gesto di ordinare \u00e8 la ripetizione compulsiva di questo rituale del ristorante costoso, conquistato dai genitori con grandi sacrifici. Cos\u00ec Doyle appena vince va a ordinare da mangiare, ma pi\u00f9 vince e pi\u00f9 la sua fame non passa, giorno e notte, e comincia a sentirsi male.Ordino tortini alla crema e doppio espresso a uno dei ristoranti del Venetian e penso che Osborne nel suo romanzo \u201ccinese\u201d ha saputo cogliere un tema \u2013 il cibo \u2013 che ricorre ovunque e con la medesima ossessivit\u00e0 nella letteratura cinese del Novecento, dominata dalla figura dell\u2019orfano affamato. Se Osborne parte dalla nostalgia borghese per un benessere perduto dei padri, qui il punto di partenza \u00e8 la fame atavica dell\u2019epoca del \u201cgrande balzo in avanti\u201d e della rivoluzione culturale, in cui la carestia e la fame accompagnarono un processo di autodistruzione che coinvolse tutta la Cina, comportando la persecuzione di intellettuali e borghesi per mano delle Guardie rosse.Per i protagonisti di molti romanzi cinesi che raccontano di quegli anni la scomparsa della societ\u00e0 contadina e l\u2019arricchimento del paese coincidono con la consumazione di pasti eccezionali, che assume toni favolosi e a tratti malsani, e la scorpacciata precede sempre il bilancio sul passato.Venetian, Macao / Paolo Pecere.I quarantuno colpi (2003) di Mo Yan ruota intorno alla produzione di carne nel \u201cpaesino mattatoio\u201d in cui \u00e8 cresciuto Luo Xiaotong, il narratore che si rifugia da un monaco buddhista per raccontare la propria vita. Nella narrazione comica e violenta risaltano le imprese di Xiaotong per procurarsi un assaggio di carne lungamente desiderato: nei ricordi d\u2019infanzia appaiono rari e preziosi avanzi di lavorazione della carne, surrogati di un\u2019abbuffata che Xiaotong conquister\u00e0 con mezzi quasi sovrannaturali, vantandosi di saper comunicare telepaticamente con i pezzi di carne. Ecco i pensieri di Xiatong che, dopo la fuga di suo padre, si trova vicino alla mamma:Notai una scatola di zinco sul portabagli della sua bicicletta. Unta di grasso, mandava un odore che mi fece venire l\u2019acquolina in bocca. Il mio olfatto potente ne intu\u00ec subito il contenuto: testa di maiale in salsa di soia e bollito di frattaglie. Nel mio cervello fluttuarono le immagini dipinte a colori vivaci di musi di maiale e zampetti stufati e le sagome serpeggianti di budella bollite e, senza volerlo, deglutii. L\u2019enormit\u00e0 di ci\u00f2 che era accaduto in famiglia quella mattina non mi aveva tolto l\u2019appetito, anzi aveva acuito la mia fame. Grande \u00e8 il cielo e grande \u00e8 la terra, ma mai tanto quanto la bocca di Luo Xiaotong; caro mi \u00e8 il padre e cara la madre, ma mai quanto la carne!Una storia simile si trova in Fratelli, di Yu Hua (2005), altro racconto rabelaisiano di una coppia d\u2019orfani che crescono nella miseria del Dopoguerra, subiscono e assistono a atroci angherie, ma infine si arricchiscono. L\u2019appetito e le mangiate sono onnipresenti: dalle Guardie rosse che, per riposarsi durante il pestaggio di un insegnante, \u201cordinarono latte di soia con frittelle youtiao e mantou\u201d, alle peripezie del piccolo Li Testapelata e di suo fratello, rimasti soli e costretti a mangiare riso al sale e a bere salsa di soia, per poi versare lacrime di gioia di fronte alle caramelle mou o affinare l\u2019ingegno per conquistarsi un piatto di spaghetti \u201cai tre sapori\u201d. In quale letteratura, del resto, si trova un cielo cos\u00ec descritto?Guard\u00f2 le foglie sugli alberi che frusciavano al vento e i suoi alluci scaldati dai raggi abbaglianti del sole. Quanto sarebbe stato bello se i raggi fossero stati straccetti di carne e il vento brodo di carne.Ancora, nel bellissimo memoir della scrittrice Xiaolu Guo, I nove continenti (2017), i ricordi di un\u2019infanzia sul mare Cinese meridionale sono percorsi dalle immagini delle alghe di laminaria bollite che si trovava sempre nella ciotola e della \u201czuppa di sangue\u201d che i famigliari raccomandavano di bere alla bambina anemica.I ricordi del cibo si fondono a drammi e immagini cruente, tanto che l\u2019atto del mangiare pu\u00f2 incarnare la bont\u00e0 e la gioia, ma anche la crudelt\u00e0 e il dolore. \u00c8 il caso del romanzo di Ma Jian, Pechino \u00e8 in Coma (2008), coinvolgente e puntuale racconto della generazione nata nel Dopoguerra che con le sue richieste di democrazia interrotte s\u2019infranse contro la repressione del 1989. Il protagonista Dai Wei, colpito da un proiettile dell\u2019esercito a piazza Tienanmen, sopravvive in coma su un lettino, accudito dalla mamma, che entra nella setta di Falung Gong e inizia dei digiuni di protesta. Wei non sente pi\u00f9 fame ma ricorda, e tra i ricordi emergono i racconti di come la fame e la rabbia della societ\u00e0 cinese, decenni prima, partorirono un esito mostruoso: \u201cfu nel 1968, uno degli anni pi\u00f9 violenti della Rivoluzione culturale. Qui non bastava uccidere i nemici di classe, i comitati rivoluzionari locali costringevano la gente a mangiarli. All\u2019inizio i corpi dei nemici venivano fatti bollire nei pentoloni insieme con le zampette di maiale. Siccome con il proseguire della campagna i cadaveri da gestire diventarono troppi, venivano cucinati soltanto cuore, fegato e cervello\u201d.Parisian, Macao / Paolo Pecere.Vado vagabondando nella zona interna di Macao tra gli edifici anneriti dall\u2019umidit\u00e0. Assisto alla riunione di una chiesa cristiana in un appartamento privato. \u201cLa parola di Dio \u00e8 cibo solido a cui svezzarsi\u201d, dice il pastore, poi tutti si buttano sull\u2019hotpot di verdure, carne e palle di pesce. Luis, uno studente di legge, si fa avanti e mi chiede se ho mangiato (hai mangiato?, in mandarino, \u00e8 come dire come stai?). Restiamo a conversare e Luis insiste per offrirmi un pranzo al ristorante. Gli chiedo cosa sanno i giovani cinesi di Tienanmen. \u201cNon se ne pu\u00f2 parlare. Ma i giovani studenti possono trovare le notizie\u201d. \u201cE che ne pensano?\u201d. \u201cLa gente sa che la democrazia e la libert\u00e0 di pensiero sono limitate, sa della corruzione, e a volte protesta. Ma lasciami spiegare una cosa: se fai un sondaggio sulle priorit\u00e0 dei cinesi, democrazia e libert\u00e0 di pensiero vengono sotto il decimo posto. Prima di tutto ci sono il benessere e la crescita economica, e gli ultimi governi le hanno garantite. Quando ero piccolo vivevo con i nonni. Facevamo a turno per uscire perch\u00e9 avevamo un solo pantalone. I bagni erano canali aperti su cui accucciarsi. Guarda oggi\u201d.Hong Kong\u201cNon avevo piani d\u2019azione se non quello di affidarmi ancora all\u2019I Ching, che lavorava nel mio inconscio [\u2026] L\u2019assenza di pensiero e\u0300 sempre il piano migliore. E per quanto possa sembrare paradossale, avevo la certezza che continuando a fidarmi del mio inconscio avrei vinto. L\u2019inconscio puo\u0300 essere frainteso, ma non ti imbroglia\u201d. Cos\u00ec Doyle continua a puntare forte, inizia una fila straordinaria di vincite, tanto che gli si pone il problema di gestirle, ma la razionalit\u00e0 \u00e8 una voce fiacca e inascoltata.Dovevo ritirarmi con un po\u2019 di profitto e pagare il Lisboa. Limitare le perdite. Ma non ce la facevo; in quel momento ero un porco e amavo la porcitudine, la smania di ingozzarsi quando si e\u0300 vicini al trogolo.\u00c8 il 24 dicembre e vado a Hong Kong, dove ho appuntamento con amici che per il giorno di Natale mi hanno promesso un banchetto che si riveler\u00e0 in effetti memorabile: \u201cti passer\u00e0 la voglia di mangiare per due giorni\u201d. \u00c8 qui che Doyle, indebitato con l\u2019hotel Lisboa, viene a rifugiarsi e a intrattenersi col pensiero del suicidio. Vede nei grattacieli \u201cil profilo di cristallo del capitalismo che ci riempie di consolazione e di terrore\u201d.Scendo da Kowloon fino al lungomare in un clima tutt\u2019altro che agitato: un pacifico reticolo di strade e parchi, locali, negozi e mercatini, percorso da un fiume di giovani e famiglie. Nell\u2019ostello dove ho trovato alloggio \u2013 cubicolo senza finestre, puzza di fumo \u2013 incontro il tipico giovane anglofono che ha staccato la spina, apparentemente a lungo, con tatuaggi, maglietta bucata e ragazza locale stretta in un abbraccio. Di quelli come lui ne ho incontrati molti. Mi ricorda quello scozzese biondo, magrissimo e con la faccia bruciata, che nel 2011 scovai in un ostello di Yazd in Iran: \u201cQuando sei partito?\u201d, mi chiese. \u201cDue settimane fa. E tu?\u201d. \u201cNel 2004\u201d.Ma qui a Hong Kong, per lo pi\u00f9, si vedono i Cinesi, eleganti e sereni, che siedono a mangiare nell\u2019intermezzo dello shopping. La statua di Bruce Lee dove l\u2019avevo vista l\u2019ultima volta, \u00e8 impacchettata, stanno rifacendo il parco. Prendo il traghetto per l\u2019isola di Hong Kong, rinvigorito dalla brezza oceanica e dallo spettacolo di luci e corridoi di cristallo che mi aspetta sull\u2019altra sponda. Mi aggiro un po\u2019 negli shopping mall, i cui bagni immacolati, in marmo e radica di noce, profumano di frangipani. Finisco col prendere un bus per il lato pi\u00f9 dimesso dell\u2019isola, Aberdeen. Spicy crab e sex shop, dicono le luci al neon onnipresenti, mentre la gente con i cappelli da babbo natale passeggia nel tepore della sera. Ritrovo i palazzi cadenti con gli scarichi dei condizionatori e le finestre sempre aperte, la Hong Kong che piano piano sta sparendo. Scende il silenzio lungo i moli che portano alle altre isole e ai ristoranti fluttuanti. L\u2019insegna del \u201cJumbo\u201d ha due lettere spente. Dei vecchi giocano a dama, qualcuno improvvisa una grigliata e mi offre una coscia di pollo.Tornato sulla terraferma, mentre mi chiedo se e dove fermarmi per la mia solitaria cena della Vigilia, intravedo l\u2019hotel Intercontinental. \u00c8 qui il ristorante esclusivo dove Doyle entra dopo la notte in bianco e inizia una colazione che non pu\u00f2 pagare. Ordina Earl grey con pane tostato, spremuta, un mimosa. Poi va al buffet e si riempie il vassoio di sushi, frutti di mare, croissant, pompelmo, uova alla savoiarda, altri mimosa: \u201cmi abbuffai senza ritegno\u201d. Il pasto \u00e8 infinito, la collezione di delizie diventa sottilmente torturante per il lettore: brandy, caff\u00e8, blinis con caviale \u00e0 la carte, altri mimosa, biscotti dolcissimi. La mente di Doyle \u201csorprendentemente non si schiarisce\u201d, la cameriera chiede il conto.Come un deus ex machina arriva in soccorso la misteriosa escort Dao-Ming, che poi lo tenta con altri cocktail e cioccolatini e se lo porta in un\u2019isoletta. La scena si sposta nella mia zona preferita di Hong Kong, le isolette appartate con le case macere d\u2019umidit\u00e0, le spiaggette con i cartelli di non balneazione (sharks!), e i templi di divinit\u00e0 del mare che si affiancano ai ristoranti con le teche piene di crostacei ancora vivi. Qui Doyle viene curato e nutrito dalla sua materna Circe, la cui generosit\u00e0 \u00e8 incondizionata e apparentemente immotivata. Riprende l\u2019elenco magico di pietanze: uova d\u2019oca rotte con latte di soja, ravioli, gin tonic, zuppa di calamari, gin, torta al limone, rum e pipa d\u2019oppio.Mentre guardavamo le tre colossali ciminiere della centrale elettrica di Lamma lei mi imboccava: pregiati cannolicchi e cicale di mare color rosa e verde pallido, servite sul dorso in crosta d\u2019aglio. Andammo al Seaview e scegliemmo trote coralline dagli acquari li\u0300 fuori o cernie miniate o tordi di mare, e ordinammo lumache di mare piccanti con vino di riso, vongole dalla proboscide e gamberi imperiali. Lei chiese per me del tofu fritto, il famoso tofu di Lamma di Nonna Tsiong. Qualsiasi cosa mangiassimo, la infilzava sulla forchetta, la alzava tenendoci sotto l\u2019altra mano e me la metteva sulla lingua; accompagnammo l\u2019assortimento con cipolline all\u2019olio, e kale con fagiolini croccanti e riso perfetto.Ma Doyle, salvato e rinvigorito, \u00e8 irredimibile: ruber\u00e0 altro denaro e torner\u00e0 a giocare. Il disordine karmico persiste fino alla misteriosa conclusione del libro.Infilo il bastoncino d\u2019incenso nella cenere del braciere. Come in tutti i templi cinesi, la gente di solito viene a fare offerte per chiamare il denaro, non diversamente da come fa l\u2019onnipresente gatto dorato che si trova su tutte le soglie e agita la zampa: venite, soldi! Il capolavoro di Osborne mi sembra intuire un intreccio di desideri in cui fede, cibo, sesso e denaro convergono, richiamando alla mente un altro capolavoro di tema orientale, La citt\u00e0 incantata di Hayao Miyazaki (2001). Nel film il mondo degli spiriti \u00e8 un centro termale (che, come spesso accade anche in Cina, include un ristorante e un bordello), dove il cibo succulento trasforma gli uomini in maiali. La bambina Chihiro, che vi accede seguendo i genitori, dimentica il suo vero nome. E poi c\u2019\u00e8 il Senza volto: uno spirito nero con una maschera bianca inespressiva e la bocca invisibile ma enorme, che attrae le altre creature con pepite d\u2019oro e le divora. Solo la rinuncia di Chihiro lo rabbonir\u00e0, violazione di quell\u2019ordine di valori.Forse proprio nella rinuncia e nell\u2019astinenza si trova un freno al desiderio di Doyle, che nel romanzo di Osborne introduce il tema meditando sulle credenze cinesi nell\u2019aldil\u00e0: \u201cogni mondo riflette le azioni della vita precedente. Quelli che rinascono come spiriti affamati sono stati molto avidi, mossi dalla bramosia. I loro bisogni insaziabili sono rappresentati dal collo lungo e il ventre gonfio. Soffrono continuamente la fame e la sete, che non possono saziare ne\u0301 estinguere\u201d. Contemplo il profilo di un Buddha sovrappeso, che qui a Hong Kong sembra spaesato, e vado a cena. Ma \u00e8 proprio la zona pi\u00f9 buddhista della Cina la prossima tappa del mio viaggio.YunnanGiro intorno al Lago verde di Kunming, dove migliaia di gabbiani dal becco rosso sciamano felici intorno alla gente che li nutre. Attraversando porte ad arco e ponti visito poi il vicino tempio buddhista di Yuantong, meraviglia di pagode ottagonali, e poi le molte splendide residenze tradizionali che si trovano ovunque, e penso che questa \u00e8 una delle citt\u00e0 pi\u00f9 belle della Cina. Ma non si tratta di \u201cconservazione\u201d. Leggendo la bellissima e istruttiva graphic novel di Li Kunwu e Philippe \u00d4ti\u00e9, Una vita cinese (2009-11) \u2013 altra epopea di sofferenza e sviluppo \u2013 si vede come Kunming sia stata sostanzialmente rasa al suolo e ricostruita, non diversamente dalle altre citt\u00e0 cinesi. Ma qui molti edifici moderni (come il museo statale) sono pi\u00f9 interessanti di quelli antichi, l\u2019aria \u00e8 pi\u00f9 pulita, e soprattutto la gente \u00e8 rilassata e socievole: \u00e8 il clima dello Yunnan, una regione di frontiera e mescolanza di minoranze etniche, ideale per chiedersi se la Cina delle metropoli e delle campagne svuotate possa un domani trasformarsi in qualcosa di diverso.Kunming / Paolo Pecere.Il tema del passato cinese \u00e8 ineludibile in Yunnan: visito Lijiang, Shaxi, Dali, Weishan, cittadine ricche di edifici d\u2019epoca nelle mura quadrate delle citt\u00e0 vecchie. Il caso esemplare \u00e8 proprio Lijiang, cui Marco D\u2019Eramo ha dedicato un capitolo del suo illuminante studio sul turismo, Il selfie del mondo (2017), parlando di \u201cinvenzione dell\u2019autenticit\u00e0\u201d. Dopo un disastroso terremoto qui le case tradizionali sono state ricostruite, anzi moltiplicate. Il sito Unesco della citt\u00e0 vecchia di Lijiang \u00e8 oggi un labirinto di meravigliosi edifici di legno, templi, pagode, canali e laghetti monumentali. Gran parte delle abitazioni sono diventati negozi, anche se in periferia si trovano nicchie in cui sopravvive la Lijiang di qualche decennio fa \u2013 una situazione di affollamento turistico, spopolamento e splendore che ricorda molto Venezia. D\u2019Eramo sottolinea che in questi \u201cgusci d\u2019antico\u201d non rimane niente di \u201cautentico\u201d, a dispetto di quanto si legge sulle brochures turistiche. Ma a parziale correzione di questo giudizio egli riflette sulla diversit\u00e0 di sguardo che condiziona gli occidentali, eredi di una tradizione moderna in cui la rovina \u00e8 stata considerata simulacro di bellezza, tanto che Diderot poteva scrivere: \u201cUn palazzo va diroccato per farne un oggetto d\u2019interesse\u201d e gli archeologi francesi decisero di lasciare le radici ad Angkor Wat, in Cambogia, per conservare l\u2019aura di giungla e avventura che nulla aveva a che fare con l\u2019aspetto originale del sito.Quello sguardo \u00e8 anche mio, perci\u00f2 Lijiang mi sembra finta. E cos\u00ec pure l\u2019altrettanto bella ma pi\u00f9 \u201cautentica\u201d (cio\u00e8 diroccata, ammuffita e meno luminosa) Shaxi, con il suo palco per il teatro tradizionale e il ponte delle carovane della via della seta: mi sembra finta laddove \u00e8 ridipinta e ristrutturata, mentre mi entusiasmo a chiacchierare con i vecchietti nella casa tradizionale Bai, guardare il forno annerito, il pozzo interno, i dipinti sbiaditi, fare la foto al signore con la spilla del partito che assiste al vecchio spettacolo teatrale e al vecchietto con la pipa che si mette in posa vicino all\u2019altare della mamma.Il punto, per\u00f2, \u00e8 che il negoziante cinese che occupa la bottega ridipinta di epoca Ming oggi la Cina crede di rivivere una gloria pari, se non superiore, a quella di allora. Non \u00e8 strano, quindi, che ci tenga a rifinire le tegole dei tetti a forma di barca e a ricalcare le pitture sui muri. Per lui o lei la cosa veramente strana \u2013 come ho verificato guidando turisti cinesi a Roma \u2013 \u00e8 che da noi le rovine non si riparino! Come scrive D\u2019Eramo, restaurare o ricostruire ex novo, per i cinesi, non toglie nulla alla \u201cverit\u00e0\u201d di edifici e reperti. \u201cCambia solo il concetto di vero\u201d.E il buddhismo? Qui il discorso si complica. Esisteva una tradizione di pensiero secolare, in santuari di montagna remoti oggi collegati da treni e funivie, in cui i monaci stanno appostati per farti pagare le divinazioni. Esisteva il Tibet, nei cui monasteri sorvegliati dalla polizia si \u00e8 rinunciato da decenni a lottare contro il dominio degli Han, e si tira sul prezzo dei thangka dipinti a mano. Esisteva una citt\u00e0 al confine dello Yunnan, Zhongdian, che nel 2001 il governo cinese ha ribattezzato Shangri-la, dal nome del best-seller Orizzonte perduto di James Hilton (1933), che racconta la scoperta di un remoto monastero abitato da uomini bianchi e straordinariamente longevi nel cuore dell\u2019Himalaya tibetana. Ci arrivo leggendo Shangri-la (2008), il breve racconto che Osborne ha dedicato a questo posto, e che contiene informazioni imbarazzanti sul libro di Hilton \u2013 che tra l\u2019altro non aveva mai messo piede da queste parti. Ma devo ammettere che, dopo aver ispirato un film di Frank Capra e ben sette spedizioni di nazisti, quel romanzo ha portato qui anche me, in un dicembre gelato.Weishan / Paolo Pecere.Nella piazza centrale della citt\u00e0 vecchia c\u2019\u00e8 un complesso bronzeo di statue in cui le Guardie rosse vengono accolte dai monaci locali, che ricevono il verbo di Mao. Tutto intorno colline ripidissime con una scenografia di pagode illuminate, e l\u2019enorme ruota di preghiera dorata che alcuni giovani giocano a girare. Osborne \u00e8 venuto qui sulle tracce di Joseph Rock, un botanico austriaco che fin\u00ec col trasferirsi a Lijiang e divenne uno dei massimi esperti della cultura autoctona naxi. Nella sua spedizione visita pure Songzalin, il pi\u00f9 grande monastero buddhista-tibetano della Cina, che \u00e8 il mio obiettivo principale. M\u2019interessa confrontare la situazione della cultura tibetana con quella che ho osservato in Ladakh e in Tibet. Il sito \u00e8 fuori citt\u00e0, si superano delle colline innevate dove pare ci fosse il cimitero tibetano, poi compare il laghetto ghiacciato, il pascolo di yak, il complesso di casette biancorosse ai piedi del massiccio di templi coronati d\u2019oro. \u201cDorature e dismisura\u201d, osserva Osborne, \u201csono due prerogative che chi viaggia in Cina pretende\u201d, e Songzalin non le fa mancare, ricompensato da un costante afflusso di turisti in minibus, che si guardano bene dal camminare.Gli interni sono magnifici e pesanti, nel consueto stile tibetano: cascate di tessuto e lampade di carta multicolori, pilastri rossi con capitelli in foglia d\u2019oro, pareti dipinte con i raccapriccianti e crudeli mostri blu e rossi e gli spiriti celestiali dorati e sereni che, come spiega il Bardo Todol, s\u2019incontreranno al momento della morte. Le statue sugli altari hanno i berretti gialli a punta della Gelugpa, la scuola clericale che amministra il monastero. L\u2019immagine del Buddha si moltiplica in innumerevoli esemplari, diventa un motivo quasi geometrico che riempie ogni vuoto. Una differenza vistosa, rispetto al Tibet, \u00e8 l\u2019uso di lampadari elettrici al posto delle soffocanti lampade al burro di yak.Suona un tamburo, si sente un colpo di piatti. Sul cortile inizia la danza dei monaci, che sono gi\u00e0 in circolo. In un monastero isolatissimo del Ladakh, quando ho assistito a una performance simile, l\u2019intero villaggio era rapito dalla scena. Qui ci sono turisti con le reflex, i monaci chiacchierano e smanettano con lo smartphone prima d\u2019iniziare a girare distrattamente. Non c\u2019\u00e8 traccia della gravit\u00e0 che da secoli si accompagna al buddhismo tibetano, a cui Osborne dedica una pagina singolarmente dura:Sono sempre stato convinto che l\u2019Occidente abbia frainteso il buddhismo, scambiandolo per una religione serena e distaccata, sinonimo di pace, calma ed equilibrio interiore. Ma quando non e\u0300 addomesticato dalla prosperita\u0300, come in Giappone, in Cina o in Thailandia, il buddhismo tira fuori una vena pessimistica, feroce. Il Tibet e\u0300 tutto, tranne che un posto sereno; poverta\u0300 e superstizioni lo espongono alle critiche degli atei. Nella sua arte c\u2019e\u0300 qualcosa di disperato, e di tragico. E\u0300 un pensiero intriso di morte, fin dalle origini. Il mondo mentale buddhista puo\u0300 proteggere dalla modernita\u0300, e in effetti gli occidentali hanno a lungo tentato di ridurlo a questo. Certo, e\u0300 una reazione rigorosa, disciplinata e sottile all\u2019orrore della vita. Congela la mente con un senso di terrore che appare una mera presa d\u2019atto della realta\u0300: quindi anche con un desiderio, comprensibile, di non vivere piu\u0300.Ci sono modi diversi di comprendere l\u2019insegnamento del Buddha, che per lo studioso Richard Gombrich era pi\u00f9 simile a un saggio ellenistico, predicatore di equilibrio e serenit\u00e0 nella vita, che a un asceta che mortifica la carne, e gi\u00e0 avvertiva: \u201c le mie parole sono come un serpente: se le afferrate nel modo sbagliato possono farvi male\u201d.In ogni caso c\u2019\u00e8 da chiedersi che ne sia di questa tensione e del tema tibetano delle visioni sulla soglia dell\u2019aldil\u00e0 \u2013 spesso richiamato dalla cultura americana, da Lynch a George Saunders \u2013 se la modernit\u00e0 \u00e8 pienamente assimilata, come nei monasteri in terra cinese. La pace e il ritiro possono trovarsi ancora in molti luoghi asiatici, ma non qui, nella misura in cui se ne vuole preservare il lato pi\u00f9 appetibile. Lo riconosce anche Osborne riflettendo sulla sua guida, La: un buddhista che trova sacrilego e inopportuno l\u2019interesse occidentale per la sua terra e infine sembra intuire che il lussuoso hotel Shangri-la, con le \u201cattrezzature futuristiche [\u2026] i giardini pensili e l\u2019aria deliziosamente fresca\u201d sia \u201cl\u2019unico posto in tutta la Cina che in qualche modo ricordasse la lamasseria di James Hilton\u201d.Shangri-La / Paolo Pecere.Quando torno a Lijiang \u00e8 il 31 sera, ma in Cina non \u00e8 l\u2019ultimo dell\u2019anno. I locali sono pieni di giovani ubriachi che cantano. A mezzanotte qualcuno intona un timido conto alla rovescia e la serata prosegue senza soluzione di continuit\u00e0. Altri occidentali non se ne vedono, e l\u2019impressione \u00e8 che quel brindisi sia uno stanco omaggio ai fantasmi, i gwai lo che vivono in un altro tempo e a volte si fanno vedere, come gli spiriti di Halloween che in Italia abbiamo accolto per moltiplicare le occasioni di divertimento.Frontiere sul MekongJinghong \u00e8 il capoluogo dello Xishuangbanna, la regione di confine con il Laos, il Myanmar, il Vietnam, dove il Mekong s\u2019ingrossa e scende tra i palmeti. E proprio il Mekong dovr\u00f2 seguire per scendere in Laos e poi deviare fino a Bangkok, dove nella mia parodia di Cuore di tenebra Osborne mi attende come un Kurtz elegante, sorseggiando un cocktail ai tavolini lungo il fiume.Agli antipodi della fredda zona settentrionale, qui lo Yunnan declina in un paesaggio tropicale ondulato di piantagioni di t\u00e8 e banane, risaie e pomeriggi sonnolenti. Si respira l\u2019atmosfera di frontiera del sudest asiatico, la stessa del romanzo di Osborne successivo alla Ballata, Cacciatori al buio (2015). Si tratta di un\u2019altra storia di denaro carico di karma negativo, occidentali persi nel gioco d\u2019azzardo tra fiumi stagnanti e citt\u00e0 traboccanti di cibo e offerte di sesso. Qui gli occidentali non sono detti gwai lo ma farang, e si muovono tra Thailandia e Cambogia. La differenza di ambientazione comporta una variabile non indifferente: sono zone pi\u00f9 adatte alla sparizione low cost.Vado a colpo sicuro in un caff\u00e8 per internazionali e ci trovo un gruppetto di viaggiatori da Italia, Spagna, Etiopia, Australia. L\u2019italiano e la spagnola sono una coppia con due bambini piccoli, vivono viaggiando, stanziali per lo pi\u00f9 in Nepal a vendere artigianato. \u201cE la scuola?\u201d Lamberto mi spiega che l\u2019istruzione scolastica italiana \u00e8 rigida e controllata: i figli per ora li educano in casa, poi si vedr\u00e0. Almeno si evita lo stillicidio delle tasse, poi in Italia ormai si vive male: \u201cFa bene Salvini a chiudere le frontiere\u201d, aggiunge, e poi continua a parlarmi dei diversi visti che loro possono ottenere per girare l\u2019Asia. Nel piacevole calore del giardino botanico incontro un\u2019altra coppia di italiani in \u201csabbatico\u201d, che hanno temporaneamente mollato il lavoro e studiano cinese a Kunming. Con loro si va qualche giorno nelle campagne a visitare i villaggi delle minoranze etnico-religiose, i Dai, gli Hui, gli Aini \u2013 con cui festeggiamo un altro capodanno. Un maestro delle medie ubriaco di vino di riso ci accoglie recitando frasi del Grande Comandante Mao. In Cacciatori al buio il protagonista Robert appartiene alla classe media erosa dalla crisi, che arriva in Cambogia da un\u2019Europa in cui \u201caspettavi che la vita cominciasse, eppure chiss\u00e0 perch\u00e9 non cominciava\u201d.Aveva intuito che le sorti del paese non si sarebbero risollevate per un bel pezzo, forse per secoli. Non si sarebbe mai sistemato come suo padre, o nemmeno come suo nonno. La macchina del progresso aveva iniziato a muoversi a ritroso e lui avrebbe fatto meglio a emigrare, neanche fosse uno sterratore irlandese di un secolo prima. Ma non c\u2019erano posti dove emigrare. Non c\u2019erano posti che lo accogliessero e gli dessero un lavoro. Il mondo che una volta era stato grande e comodo, con l\u2019America all\u2019orizzonte, era diventato via via piccolo, angosciato e recintato da un muro. I suoi genitori non riuscivano a capirlo, e in un certo senso nemmeno lui.Anche stavolta la salvezza arriver\u00e0 soltanto con la rinuncia al denaro, dopo una vicenda aspra e sanguinosa in cui Robert rischier\u00e0 la vita. Ma una novit\u00e0 del libro \u00e8 il racconto dello sguardo dell\u2019emigrazione opposta, quello di Sophal, giovane cambogiana di buona famiglia, con cui Robert comincia a uscire. Per un qualche anno \u00e8 andata a Parigi restandone delusa, provandovi una sensazione di decadenza:Una decadenza al rallentatore, che cresceva di pari passo con una campagna un po\u2019 isterica di rinnovamento urbano e rispettabilit\u00e0 antisettica. Ma gli uomini pisciavano lo stesso per le strade, e c\u2019era lo stesso un\u2019aria di stasi e vecchiaia strisciante. L\u2019Europa che moriva in piedi di torpore, tracotanza e debiti.Il racconto di questo sguardo dei migranti asiatici in occidente, che \u00e8 il rovesciamento del solito romanzo coloniale fuori tempo, si diffonde sempre di pi\u00f9 (un bell\u2019esempio cinese \u00e8 A modo nostro di Chen He, 2011) e m\u2019interessa: \u00e8 la ragione per cui preferisco lasciare gli Italiani e appartarmi con gente locale. Con un amico gentilissimo, Zhao, passano due giorni tra conversazioni sul buddhismo sotto i baldacchini di afosi templi al confine col Myanmar, visite a mercati e bevute di t\u00e8 pu\u2019er. Tornati a Jinghong, di sera lungo il Mekong, la gente fa tai chi e qualcuno canta stridule arie d\u2019opera cinese. Seguendo la corrente lenta del fiume si entra in Laos.BangkokFanno 33 gradi, sono a Bangkok, nel quartiere di Wang Lang, che Osborne descrive come \u201cil posto perfetto per uno sderenato, l\u2019habitat naturale per un latitante che si svegliava la mattina con un\u2019unica idea fissa, andarsene in giro e vedere cosa riusciva a trovare, e che amava passeggiare senza scopo, per il gusto di farlo\u201d. Rispetto ai suoi romanzi Bangkok (2009) \u2013 come il precedente racconto asiatico di non-fiction, Il turista nudo (2006) \u2013 \u00e8 per un verso un libro pi\u00f9 leggero, a tratti comico, che racconta in tono dissacrante e empatico la figura di esuli fancazzisti e puttanieri. Ma al tempo stesso \u00e8 un libro riflessivo e a tratti commovente, che racconta angoli e personaggi della citt\u00e0 che altrimenti resterebbero inimmaginabili, come quando s\u2019interroga sull\u2019enigmatica serenit\u00e0 di Sorella Joan che gestisce un centro per bambini di strada in uno slum.Bangkok / Paolo PecereOsborne a Bangkok ci vive. Come racconta nel Turista nudo, tutto sarebbe cominciato con un\u2019operazione odontoiatrica nelle cliniche private ottime e relativamente poco costose della citt\u00e0. Dopodich\u00e9 l\u2019autore-narratore comincia a andare e venire, incontra occidentali distrutti e imbarazzanti, tutti maschi che hanno inscenato una finta morte o altri trucchi per scappare. Uno di loro, Brian, lo porta a trascorrere serate in improbabili club post-coloniali o nel bar di un hotel di lusso che \u201csembrava il Titanic qualche attimo prima di affondare\u201d. Le residenze dei farang sono tutte in una stessa zona di residence, per cui a Osborne capita di osservare dalla finestra l\u2019appartamento di un pittore spagnolo:Si vedevano grandi tele appoggiate al muro, qualche candela accesa per dare un tocco boh\u00e9mien, e a volte una figura nuda che passeggiava avanti e indietro con un libro in mano, leggendolo e ondeggiando come uno studioso della Torah. Sembrava uguale a me, un europeo fuori di testa, nudo, che crepava di caldo. Ma a Bangkok, tra farang, non si fanno domande.L\u2019esotismo eroico \u00e8 gi\u00e0 crollato da un pezzo e il racconto fa i conti con i problemi psicologici e fisici di questi bevitori incalliti, drogati e consumatori di viagra, che alla fine sentono urgente bisogno di farsi accudire da una madre sostitutiva. Una delle scene pi\u00f9 belle del libro racconta proprio della lunga degenza di Osborne per un\u2019improvvisa malattia, in una clinica che \u00e8 un hotel dotato di tutti i comfort con tanto di murales di \u201cCristo che beve alla festa di Alessandro Magno\u201d. Osborne ci incontra una serie di occidentali morenti, tra cui Fritzy, un tizio con la flebo che appena se lo trova in stanza ordina subito due gin tonic e racconta di essere in attesa che gli taglino un testicolo.Andare in clinica era tra i miei piani perch\u00e9 pochi giorni prima ho avuto un incidente in Laos, con tanto di visita all\u2019agghiacciante ospedale di Luang Prabang, ma mi \u00e8 andata bene e riesco a camminare con gamba e mano fasciate, come un pellegrino tra i palazzi reali e gli innumerevoli templi buddhisti, a partire dai monumentali Wat Phra Kaew, con i corridoi dipinti con storie del Ramayana (mostri e sirene, principesse che dormono sul pelo dell\u2019acqua), e il Wat Pho col Buddha disteso. Al tramonto non perdo mai l\u2019inizio delle preghiere collettive, dove rubo quel confortante senso di pace e raccoglimento tipico dei templi buddhisti, che qui sono obiettivamente luoghi fantastici e onirici, con statue d\u2019oro enormi e ovunque fiori e pietre luccicanti (il tutto, naturalmente, tra pareti ridipinte di fresco, popolate da altre storie e altri buddha). Percorro decine di chilometri nel caldo molle della Bangkok \u201cvecchia\u201d, attraversando pi\u00f9 volte il fiume coperto di schiuma e alghe, fermandomi nei templi cinesi pieni di fumo e fiori, mercati di frutta e amuleti, e ancora wat meravigliosi: il Tempio dell\u2019alba (Wat Arun), il Wat Suthat, il Wat sulla Montagna d\u2019Oro.Bangkok / Paolo PecereGi\u00e0 questo basterebbe a incantarmi, ma c\u2019\u00e8 la sorpresa della Bangkok moderna. Come dice Osborne, in pochi anni la citt\u00e0 ha avuto uno sviluppo rapidissimo, si ha l\u2019impressione che \u201cdopo secoli caos la citt\u00e0 volesse solo ordine e geometria \u2013 e li stesse ottenendo\u201d. \u00c8 netto il contrasto tra l\u2019ammucchiarsi degli edifici vecchi, rosi dall\u2019umido e coperti di ragnatele di cavi elettrici, e i palazzi delle zone nuove, eppure si ha l\u2019impressione che un filo conduttore di ottimismo innervi il tutto.Me lo conferma Bank, una guida turistica con cui mi sono dato appuntamento dall\u2019Italia, che si presenta in Suv e mi porta a cena. In Europa, forse ingannati da qualche decennio di retorica del benessere definitivo e di quieta contemplazione del Passato, tendiamo a pensare al tempo come a un processo impercettibile. Qui in pochi anni cambia tutto e Bank, che ne ha poco pi\u00f9 di trenta, ha fondato un\u2019azienda con dieci dipendenti, ha un resort in Chiang mai, e porta turisti in tutta Europa. I clienti sono nuovi borghesi thailandesi, pieni di soldi da spendere. \u201cSono appena tornato dalla Svizzera, tredici giorni, due sole ragazze. Ho fatto una fortuna\u201d. \u201cLa Svizzera a dicembre. Che ci vanno a fare, lo sci?\u201d \u201cNo! Ma i servizi sono ottimi. I turisti che vanno in Europa vogliono mangiare e stare comodi\u201d, dopodich\u00e9 ordina un\u2019altra caraffa di birra.Ancora una camminata notturna lungo il fiume: le case lungo i canali acquitrinosi, la chiesa di Santa Cruz, il tempio taoista. M\u2019imbatto in uno spettacolo di teatro cinese con le maschere e, dall\u2019altro lato del fiume, una festa animata al Wat Prayungwongsawat. Sui vari palchi sotto gli stupa bianchi si suona e si balla, mentre i monaci in tunica arancio ciabattano e fotografano con i cellulari, prima di ritirarsi a pregare. Amuleti e wok col riso fritto, sacro e profano convivono nel medesimo spazio.Bangkok / Paolo PecereOsborne racconta soprattutto le zone sordide della citt\u00e0, osserva gli uomini soli nelle zone dei \u201ccentri massaggi\u201d. Nel suo racconto non c\u2019\u00e8 moralismo quanto piuttosto distacco e una punta di stupore per il modo sereno e giocoso in cui \u00e8 vissuto l\u2019erotismo nella cultura locale. Nelle ultime pagine accenna al fascino del buddhismo come dottrina che ha \u201cbandito il dramma dell\u2019amore\u201d, si sofferma sulla fredda bellezza dei gesti di una donna che compra un pesce gatto al mercato e lo libera nel fiume.Il libro pone molte domande senza risposta e la curiosit\u00e0 di parlarne con l\u2019autore aumenta. Ma Osborne \u00e8 una voce silenziosa che parla dalle pagine, ma non risponde al mio messaggio. Questo dialogo mancato tra fantasmi mi fa venire in mente uno scambio tra Doyle e un amico nella Ballata: \u201cPer loro siamo tutti spiriti. Non esistiamo nemmeno. La mia ragazza dice alle sue amiche che sono un fantasma. Ci credi? Quando le telefonano fa: \u2018Adesso non posso parlare, ho qui un fantasma\u2019\u201d.Il fantasma non si mostra e decido di andare al mare. Il litorale di Pattaya, oltre che per le doverose palme e i chilometri di sabbia, \u00e8 famoso per i resort a buon mercato e la prostituzione, \u201cmassage massage!\u201d. Ci trovo un\u2019enclave di turisti russi, arabi, e una intera popolazione di anziani d\u2019ogni paese occidentale. Pattaya sembra una casa di riposo a cielo aperto, in cui abbondano carrozzine elettriche cariche di corpi obesi e tatuati, e enigmatiche coppie spaesate ai tavolini dei bar di fronte ai bordelli, che mangiano in silenzio le bistecche australiane e le ostriche.Dopo un giorno di camminate ne ho abbastanza, e l\u2019indomani ho il volo di rientro. In quel momento mi contatta Osborne: \u201cEro fuori citt\u00e0, scusa. Tu dove stai?\u201d. Da Pattaya a Bangkok sono tre ore. Rientrare in fretta e furia, conciato cos\u00ec con le fasciature per un rapido drink, sembra a entrambi un\u2019ipotesi impraticabile. Non se ne fa niente, ci si d\u00e0 appuntamento al futuro. Salgo zoppicando fino al tempio sulla collina, dove trovo un Buddha smagrito e uno grasso. Qui sopra almeno si spengono i rimbombi dei discobar, e posso ripensare al fiume schiumoso di Bangkok, al caldo pesante, ai canti serali nei wat profumati, al dipinto della bella vestita d\u2019oro, che dorme sul pelo dell\u2019acqua e sorride felice."

Home-appliance makers Gree Electric Appliances Inc. and Midea Group Co. follow with 7.6 billion yuan and 5.6 billion yuan, respectively.The surge in investment is neither irrational nor a bullish sign for Chinese stocks, said Chen Guo, chief strategist at brokerage Essence Securities (link in Chinese).

L\u2019id\u00e9e est s\u00e9duisante, mais pas s\u00fbr que cela marche quand, dans ce domaine aussi, la Chine affiche une insolente r\u00e9ussite. Valoris\u00e9 en bourse autour de 130 milliards d\u2019euros, le groupe Kweichow Moutai p\u00e8se \u00e0 lui seul plus que LVMH, pourtant num\u00e9ro 1 mondial du luxe. Et figure parmi les plus grosses entreprises de la plan\u00e8te. Pas \u00e9tonnant que les ouvriers de base du groupe soient quelques uns des mieux pay\u00e9s et des mieux trait\u00e9s de Chine, atteignant pas loin de l\u2019\u00e9quivalent d\u2019un smic fran\u00e7ais de salaire mensuel, ce qui repr\u00e9sente une petite rente pour un employ\u00e9 asiatique.Plus sp\u00e9culatif que les grands BordeauxM\u00eame si, officiellement, le flacon d\u2019un demi-litre de Moutai est mis en vente autour de 200 euros lorsqu\u2019il sort des chaines d\u2019emballage de l\u2019entreprise d\u2019Etat, n\u2019esp\u00e9rez pas en trouver \u00e0 ce prix-l\u00e0 en Chine, y compris chez les revendeurs officiels. Si vous n\u2019acceptez pas de payer plus, le commer\u00e7ant invoquera une rupture de stock imaginaire. Dans ce contexte, tout ce qui touche au Moutai se transforme en or, puisque cet alcool est devenu autant, voire plus sp\u00e9culatif, que les grands Bordeaux. Sous le sceau de l\u2019anonymat, un revendeur confie : \u00ab Le simple fait de stocker plusieurs ann\u00e9es des flacons, parfois obtenus par des fili\u00e8res parall\u00e8les ou gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 des r\u00e9seaux officieux, peut cr\u00e9er rapidement des fortunes personnelles. Rien d\u2019\u00e9tonnant \u00e0 cela quand certaines cuv\u00e9es collectors atteignent tr\u00e8s vite des milliers d\u2019euros. Donc moins on \u00e9coule de marchandise, plus on est potentiellement riche \u00bb. Si l\u2019on ajoute \u00e0 Moutai tous les autres baijiu vendus dans le monde, l\u2019ensemble du march\u00e9 repr\u00e9sente \u00e0 lui seul un chiffre d\u2019affaire de 60 milliards d\u2019euros par an. A comparer avec les 3 malheureux milliards que p\u00e8se notre cognac national.L\u2019or vert du tourismeOr blanc du baijiu, mais aussi or vert du tourisme qu\u2019il commence \u00e0 drainer. Richissime, la petite cit\u00e9 de Maotai, avec seulement 30 000 \u00e2mes, vient d\u2019inaugurer son propre a\u00e9roport et son immense palace un peu tape-\u00e0-l\u2019\u0153il au c\u0153ur de la ville. Objectif : accueillir une client\u00e8le riche et hupp\u00e9e, aussi bien nationale qu\u2019internationale, curieuse de mieux connaitre le Moutai, ses processus de fabrication, ses mus\u00e9es, ses producteurs ou ses boutiques nich\u00e9es dans le d\u00e9dale des belles maisons traditionnelles en bois et en pierre de la vieille ville. Mais ces touristes viennent aussi dans la r\u00e9gion pour y prendre le bon air. Dans une Chine d\u00e9vor\u00e9e par la pollution, les montagnes de la province de Guizhou, \u00e0 moins de trois heures d\u2019avion de Shangha\u00ef, attirent un public de plus en plus avide de nature et d\u2019authenticit\u00e9. Des valeurs sur lesquelles Moutai, \u00e0 rebours du mod\u00e8le capitalistique chinois, a b\u00e2ti son succ\u00e8s, puisque la qualit\u00e9 de son alcool est le fruit d\u2019un savoir-faire artisanal, d\u2019un climat sp\u00e9cifique, d\u2019un terroir pr\u00e9serv\u00e9. Et de la lente action du temps.A voir la mine grave et satisfaite de M. Wang, vice-pr\u00e9sident du groupe, lorsqu\u2019il porte un toast et trinque avec moi avant de vider son verre cul sec, lon comprend que la longue marche de Moutai vers la gloire \u2013 et les profits qui vont avec! \u2013 ne fait que commencer.",

Cognac ? Vodka ? Gin ? R\u00e9ponse : le baijiu. Le quoi ? Le baijiu (prononcer ba\u00ef-djo), un alcool blanc titrant autour des 50 \u00b0, \u00e9labor\u00e9 en Chine \u00e0 partir de c\u00e9r\u00e9ales (sorgho, bl\u00e9, riz, riz gluant, ma\u00efs, pois\u2026). Avec le th\u00e9, l\u2019autre grande boisson nationale chinoise. Et un must absolu pour ce qui concerne l\u2019empereur des baijiu : le Moutai (prononcer Mao-Ta\u00ef), fabriqu\u00e9 par l\u2019une des entreprises les plus prosp\u00e8res au monde: Kweichow Moutai. Et pour cause : certains vieux flacons peuvent s\u2019arracher \u00e0 plusieurs dizaines de milliers d\u2019euros l\u2019unit\u00e9, le record \u00e9tant de\u2026 1,2 million d\u2019euros le demi-litre ! Un comble quand le baijiu de base, lui, vendu en vrac et puis\u00e9 dans d\u2019immenses jarres en terre cuite, peut ne co\u00fbter que quelques euros le litre dans un pays o\u00f9 il est depuis des si\u00e8cles pr\u00e9sent sur toutes les tables, m\u00eame les plus modestes.Je vous propose donc, pour d\u00e9marrer goul\u00fbment l\u2019ann\u00e9e du \u00ab cochon de terre brun \u00bb, de partir \u00e0 la d\u00e9couverte en trois \u00e9pisodes de cet alcool qui commence tout juste \u00e0 investir l\u2019Europe et \u00e0 faire tourner la t\u00eate des bar tenders. Une boisson hors normes qui nous r\u00e9v\u00e8le une Chine aussi m\u00e9connue qu\u2019inattendue.Une passion tr\u00e8s ancienne pour les alcools fortsCette passion chinoise pour les boissons fortes ferment\u00e9es remonte \u00e0 pr\u00e8s de 10 000 ans, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9couvert en visitant le mus\u00e9e de la ville de Maotai, petite cit\u00e9 montagnarde perdue au fin fond du sud-est de la Chine subtropicale. Cette bourgade a donn\u00e9 son nom au pr\u00e9cieux breuvage. Cern\u00e9 par des jarres mill\u00e9naires en bronze, j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 surpris d\u2019apprendre dans ce mus\u00e9e que les lointains anc\u00eatres de Confucius produisaient depuis toujours des boissons alcoolis\u00e9es. Mais c\u2019est vers 1500 avant J.-C. qu\u2019une nouvelle technique dot\u00e9e d\u2019un nom barbare \u2013 la saccharification-fermentation parall\u00e8le \u2013 vient tout changer. Ce processus chimique naturel consiste \u00e0 transformer les sucres complexes des c\u00e9r\u00e9ales en sucres simples, alors m\u00eame qu\u2019a lieu la fermentation alcoolique. Ce syst\u00e8me tr\u00e8s \u00e9labor\u00e9 fonctionne \u00e9galement gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l\u2019action d\u2019un champignon qui conf\u00e8re au Moutai ses ar\u00f4mes uniques.L\u2019anc\u00eatre du Moutai, lui, n\u2019apparait qu\u2019en 135 avant J.-C. Nomm\u00e9e Goujiang, cette liqueur connait si rapidement la gloire qu\u2019elle est \u00e9lev\u00e9e au rang d\u2019offrande imp\u00e9riale. Mais le baijiu produit sous l\u2019appellation Moutai, donc tel qu\u2019on le connait de nos jours, commence \u00e0 faire la renomm\u00e9e de la ville il y a \u201cseulement\u201d trois si\u00e8cles. Un nom aujourd\u2019hui aussi c\u00e9l\u00e8bre en Asie que celui de Cognac en Occident. Car Moutai est \u00e0 la cat\u00e9gorie des baijiu ce que Margaux est au gros rouge qui t\u00e2che. Un must que les milliardaires s\u2019arrachent au prix fort, pour le plaisir de d\u00e9guster ou de sp\u00e9culer.(Vous d\u00e9couvrez la suite de la saga du Moutai demain, dans mon prochain post.)"

REUTERS/Stringer Acquire Licensing RightsBEIJING (Reuters) - The anti-graft watchdog in China's southwestern Guizhou province on Thursday banned officials and their family members from taking part in operations or using their position to influence sales for liquor giant Kweichow Moutai Co Ltd.Guizhou-based Moutai is the world's largest alcohol firm by market cap, valued at around $110 billion, and sells the pungent liquor baijiu for more than $200 per 500 ml bottle.The brand has close ties to Chinese politics and has largely weathered a crackdown on luxury spending under President Xi Jinping, who has called on Communist Party officials to be frugal, upright and disciplined.Officials, their spouses and children are prohibited from taking part in the operations of Moutai, according to new rules posted online by the Guizhou Discipline Inspection Commission, the provincial anti-corruption watchdog.Cadres are also banned from using the power and influence of their position to acquire Moutai business licenses for people they have a \"special relationship\" with, or to raise sales targets and help facilitate resales at a profit, the rules said.Cadres should \"educate and properly manage\" relatives and those close to them to avoid breaking the new rules, the document said.Officials who engage in any form of business-related interaction with the company have to be recorded in a new registry and failing to do so will trigger a \"serious\" investigation, the watchdog said.Moutai's baijiu liquor is often a lubricant at official banquets and business dinners, and it was once hailed as helping China's Red Army survive the tortuous Long March in the 1930s.The company in October posted its weakest quarterly profit since 2015, depressing its shares and raising concerns about the luxury liquor market.Moutai on Jan. 2 announced a higher than expected sales target for 2019, leading analysts to predict sustained stable growth in the medium-and-long run.Reporting by Christian Shepherd; editing by Darren SchuettlerOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "description": "LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Most big companies operating in sectors at high risk of labor abuses are failing to meet human rights standards set by the United Nations, according to an analysis of 100 major companies published on Monday.From tackling child labor to ensuring equal treatment for women, U.N. principles require all businesses prove they are committed to human rights and treat workers fairly.But an analysis of more than 100 major apparel, agricultural and extraction firms by the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark (CHRB), a British charity, found many had little to show for.Sportswear giant Adidas came top with 87 out of 100 points in the ranking that used public information on practices and policies on issues such as transparency, forced labor and the living wage to rank companies.It was followed by miners Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton, while two Chinese companies - liquor maker Kweichow Moutai and fast fashion brand Heilan Home - were ranked last.But almost two-thirds of firms scored less than 30 points, putting the overall average at 27.\"The majority are failing to make the grade,\" CHRB director Margaret Wachenfeld said in a statement.The study comes as big brands face growing pressure from regulators and consumers to ensure their global operations are not tainted by modern-day slavery, with campaigners estimating almost 25 million people worldwide are trapped in forced labor.More than 40 percent of businesses analyzed scored zero on human rights due diligence - the practice of identifying and addressing the risk of abuses.CONCERNING FINDINGS\"Forced and child labor, gender equality and protecting activists are some of the most pressing issues of our time,\" said John Morrison, the head of the London-based Institute of Human Rights and Business, a think tank.\"Companies need to show how they're addressing these challenges\".A low score did not indicate bad practices in a company but showed the company had made available little or no information on its actions to address the risk of human rights violations, CHRB said.China's Kweichow Moutai ranked bottom, followed by Heilan Home and U.S. energy drinks maker Monster Beverage. None of these companies replied to requests for comment.Coffee chain Starbucks and fashion houses Prada and Hermes also ranked among the worst.A spokesman for Starbucks said the company had zero-tolerance policies for human rights infractions and was dedicated to bringing customers coffee \"sourced in the most ethically way possible\".Hermes said respect of human rights and labor laws was deeply rooted in its core values, organization and production chain.Both companies questioned the ranking's methodology, saying it did not reflect their commitment to human rights.A spokeswoman for Prada said the company preferred not to comment.Caroline Robinson, director of the British charity Focus on Labour Exploitation, said the report's findings were concerning.\"Companies simply aren't doing enough,\" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\"If businesses are not prepared to take meaningful action ... then government intervention will be needed to move corporate responsibility from option to necessity\".CHRB called on investors to help drive change by challenging poorly performing companies to do better.Insurance firm Aviva, Swedish bank Nordea and Dutch financial services provider APG had already pledged to use the ranking to inform future investment decisions, it said.Reporting by Umberto Bacchi @UmbertoBacchi, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith.

            "description": "Despite its relative obscurity in the United States, the Chinese spirit, baijiu, is one of the most-consumed liquors in the world. Chinese distilleries are starting to invest in marketing the product in markets outside of Asia, including America.With a reputation mostly as a crazy-strong booze (it\u2019s not unusual for a baijiu to be above 50 percent alcohol by volume), baijiu isn\u2019t so much a specific liquor but what the Chinese call hard liquor, according to Derek Sandhaus, who wrote a book on the spirit while living in China and co-founded the baijiu company, Ming River.Recommended Videos\u201cIt\u2019s a very big country and they make a lot of types of hard liquors and call them all baijiu,\u201d Sandhaus said. \u201cThe first hurdle with baijiu is to understand past experience is not indicative of what a future experience will be.\u201dChinese alcohols pretty much all date as far back as 2,000 BC, using a method mixing grain and water mashed into a paste before incubating and decomposing with mold and yeast. Once the mash is broken done, it\u2019s mixed with fresh grain which helps create the alcohol. The mash is called qu.\u201cThey didn\u2019t know at the time (it was a few thousand years before modern chemistry), but what the mold does is eat the starch and turns it to sugar, which the yeast eats and turn to alcohol,\u201d Sandhaus said, explaining it\u2019s basically a combination of the malting and mashing process in Western cultures. \u201cYou essentially create a solid mash of fermented grains and press the alcohol out. With baijiu, they use a still that is basically a giant dim sum, vegetable steamer.\u201dIn China, baijiu is made to match the regional cuisines \u2014 which vary greatly in the giant nation \u2014 and are most often served neat along with the food. If not consumed with food, it\u2019s infused with fruits and traditional Chinese medicinal ingredients. Sandhaus said in the U.S., they are trying to introduce it by integrating the flavors in cocktails by working with bartenders.The four main aromas of baijiu \u2014 rice, light, heavy, and sauce aromas \u2014 make up nearly 99 percent of the baijiu that is produced and consumed in China.There are 12 types of regional baijius, according to Sandhaus, but there are four main types, each of which is named by its aroma. A unique production process helps dictate the final flavors. Most taste vastly different than Western styles of booze.\u201cOne thing we like to explain is, yeah, it tastes funny,\u201d Sandhaus said. \u201cIt has alcohol in it, but they aren\u2019t doing it the same way so it shouldn\u2019t taste the same way. The flavors they\u2019re trying to produce aren\u2019t necessarily the same flavors of gin, rum, or whiskey.\u201dThe four main aromas of baijiu \u2014 rice, light, heavy, and sauce aromas \u2014 make up nearly 99 percent of the baijiu that is produced and consumed in China, Sandhaus said. Below, we take a look at the four major styles and an example of each.Rice AromaVinn DistilleryHailing from the southern coast of China, the rice aroma baijiu is made entirely from rice and is the gentlest in flavors \u2014 like a soft vodka. With cuisine from the region being mild and using subtle ingredients in steamed dumplings and seafood, the baijiu is reflective with its delicate aroma and slightly floral on the palate. Vinn Distillery makes the only 100 percent U.S. baijiu, in Oregon, and is produced by a family from Vietnam, hailing from just south of the Chinese baijiu-producing region.Light AromaKinmen KaoliangIn Beijing, cold weather necessitates the strongest baijiu, coming in at 58 percent ABV. Despite the strength, light aroma is quite smooth and also quite subtle in flavor. The food in Northern China is often hardy and salty \u2014 meat and potato or noodle dishes lacking heavy spices. For this style, look for Kinmen Kaoliang, which is made in Taiwan. Sandhaus likened light aroma, appropriately, to grappa on the nose, and on the palate, the baijiu is grassy and herbaceous. And while all baijius can have a slight barnyard funkiness on the backend, it\u2019s most notable on the light aroma.Strong AromaMing River BaijiuPerhaps most friendly to Americans will be strong aroma baijiu. From the southwest of China, the strong aroma smells intensely of pineapple and is full of fruit notes ranging from papaya to apple and follows with a bit of that funkiness. The strong sweet flavors are meant to tame the spicy cuisine in the Sichuan province it hails from. This is the style of Ming River\u2019s baijiu, which is made in a partnership with the oldest continuously-operated baijiu distillery which uses production pits dating back to 1573.Sauce AromaKweichow Moutai PrinceWithout a doubt, the most challenging baijiu for Westerners will be sauce aroma, which is full of umami flavors not normally found in beverages. From a region less than 100 miles from where the Ming River baijiu is produced, the cuisine is similarly spicy, but with sour notes. These savory notes within the baijiu help temper those food flavors and come from a hybrid production method that cooks the mash more than the other aromas. A supremely funky aroma leads to flavors of sesame, soy sauce, and mushroom on the tongue. Check out Kweichow Moutai Prince. Sandhaus equated it to jumping into really peaty Scotch without knowing other whisky well, but that sauce aroma is very popular in China.Editors' Recommendations",

This represents an improvement on 2017, when the average score was 18%, but the report states that the results are still \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and raise questions about how serious companies are about \u201cavoiding harm to people in their pursuit of profits\u201d.More than 40% of the companies scored no points whatsoever on human rights due diligence \u2013 the practice of identifying and addressing the risk of abuses.Human rights due diligence has been one of the expectations put forward in the Responsible Business Initiative currently being debated in the Swiss parliament. More governments including France and the Netherlands are mandating human rights due diligence in part out of skepticism about the impact of voluntary initiatives to push companies to change practices.External Content Your subscription could not be saved.

The latter has been at the centre of several corruption scandals recently, including accusations (by Public Eye and Global Witness) of involvement in the Brazil Car Wash corruption scandal.Overall, sportswear company Adidas came out on top with 87% followed by two of the largest mining companies, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton. Liquor maker Kweichow Moutai and fast fashion brand Heilan Home, both Chinese companies, came in last. Starbucks, Prada and Hermes were also among some of the worst ranked companies.The ranking assessed 101 of the largest apparel, agricultural and extraction firms using public information on practices and policies on issues such as transparency, forced labour and the living wage. It used 100 indicators based on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, as well as additional industry-specific standards.The authors note that poor performance does not necessarily mean that bad practices are present or there is no company action on the issue, but could be that insufficient information is available.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bArticles in this story Responsible Business debate could cause ripple effects globallyIn compliance with the JTI standardsMore: SWI swissinfo.ch certified by the Journalism Trust Initiative",

Damit ist der hierzulande nahezu unbekannte Klare die beliebteste Spirituose der Welt, \u00f6fter getrunken als Wodka und Whisky zusammen. Es war \u00fcbrigens ein Deutscher, der den Chinesen ihren eigenen Schnaps so richtig schmackhaft machte. Matthias Heger gr\u00fcndete 2013 mit drei Freunden (darunter Derek Sandhaus, Verfasser einer Art Baijiu-Bibel) in Peking die Bar Capital Spirits. Dort werden ausschlie\u00dflich Baijiu-Cocktails ausgeschenkt, ein Novum, denn \u00fcblicherweise trinkt man den Schnaps pur zum Essen. Zun\u00e4chst kamen nur Touristen und sogenannte Expats, dann die \u201eNew York Times\u201c und schlie\u00dflich auch Einheimische.Nachdem Heger vielen Chinesen gezeigt hat, dass der \u201ewei\u00dfe Alkohol\u201c mehr sein kann als ein schneller Weg zum Rausch, will er diesen nun nach Deutschland bringen. Von Berlin aus vertreibt er einen f\u00fcnfundvierzigprozentigen Baijiu, hergestellt von Luzhou Laojiao, der \u00e4ltesten durchgehend betriebenen Destillerie Chinas.",

[Photo by Yang Jun/China Daily]Share price of liquor maker slips but consumption upgrades to buoy future prospectsKweichow Moutai Co Ltd, China's signature high-end spirit maker, reported slower profit growth in the third quarter, as lower deliveries and an overall market slowdown had dampened growth.Sales totaled 18.85 billion yuan ($2.71 billion) in the third quarter, up 3.82 percent year-on-year, and net profit reached 8.97 billion yuan in the period, edging up 2.71 percent year-on-year, according to the company's latest earnings report.The results marked Moutai's slowest quarterly growth since 2012.In the first three quarters of the year, the company achieved sales revenue of 52.24 billion yuan, jumping 23.07 percent year-on-year. The company's net profit reached 24.73 billion yuan, expanding 23.77 percent on last year.Shanghai-listed Moutai dropped to 549.09 yuan per share to close 10 percent lower in Monday trading, hitting the daily limit. The company's valuation now stands at 690 billion yuan.Earlier this year, Moutai, a distiller from Maotai in Southwest China's Guizhou province, became the first consumer stock to achieve a market value of over 1 trillion yuan during trading.On Monday, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges both saw lukewarm performances, while the liquor sector saw a sharp decline. Moutai rivals Wuliangye Yibin Co Ltd and Gujing Group, among others, saw their shares slump by the daily limit of 10 percent.Investment bank BOC International (China) Co Ltd said that from 2019 to 2020, the overall growth rate of the liquor sector in China will slow, as the sector's cycle returns from the significant growth achieved in 2017 and 2018.Yet, market demand remains robust, and the ongoing consumption upgrade trend will not change, meaning it is unlikely that Moutai's prices will plunge in the near future, BOC said.\"In September, Moutai liquor deliveries were lower than expected, resulting in slower performance growth, indicating that the company tends to keep its product prices stable,\" the bank said.\"The slower sales performance could lead to concern among investors. Moutai's value has dropped to a relatively low level, and after a period of pessimism, there will likely emerge some good opportunities for new investments,\" it said.Li Baofang, chairman of Moutai, said earlier the company predicts whole-year sales revenue of 90 billion yuan for 2018. Next year, it expects to achieve sales revenue of 100 billion yuan.A 500 milliliter bottle of Moutai's classic Feitian 53 percent liquor that left the factory in 2015 now carries a price tag of 2,299 yuan on online shopping platform JD. In July, the same product retailed for 2,388 yuan.",

Photo: VCGChinese liquor stocks extended their losses on Tuesday after plummeting the previous day, as the industry leader\u2019s dry financial results followed rumors of upcoming wine-tax hikes.Shares of China\u2019s most valuable tipple-maker, Kweichow Moutai Co. Ltd., closed down 4.57% on Tuesday to 524 yuan ($75.30) after opening down beyond the 10% daily limit on Monday for the first time ever.Its stock price reached its lowest point in a year on the heels of tepid third-quarter results released over the weekend. The profit edged up by 2.7% to nearly 9 billion yuan, the slowest quarterly increase since 2015, while revenue grew only 3.8%, to 19.7 billion yuan. The two indicators grew 40% and 38% respectively in the first half of the year.Smaller rivals have also faced a stock market slump. Wuliangye Yibin Co. Ltd. and Jiangsu Yanghe Brewery Joint-Stock Co. Ltd. continued to drop after falling by the daily 10% limit on Monday. The shares of 36 alcohol stocks listed on the Chinese mainland tracked by information provider Wind declined by an average of 2.77% on Tuesday.In an attempt to reassure the market, Moutai said in a Tuesday filing to the Shanghai bourse that the third-quarter results were \u201cin line with its expectations,\u201d and that its businesses have been \u201cstable.\u201dMarket sentiment has been downbeat since early this month when rumors of an increase in the consumer tax on high-end baijiu began to spread. Concerns were heightened last week when a draft health care bill called for higher cigarette taxes, but so far there is no official sign of higher alcohol levies.China\u2019s baijiu industry has been through tough times since 2013, when Beijing launched an anti-graft campaign that sent fears through the sector, as China\u2019s most popular hooch is a popular gift and social lubricant for deal-making. The companies started to recover in 2016 and a year later brewed a growth rate peak among the past few years. Analysts attributed the recent slowdown to a high benchmark from 2017.A report from Founder Securities said that Moutai\u2019s slowdown in the third quarter was mainly caused by a particularly strong performance last year and a shortage of Moutai due to its its complicated production process.Independent liquor-industry analyst Cai Xuefei said that the economic slowdown has added pressure to the entire baijiu market, and that Moutai intentionally cooled sales so that there would be room for growth next year.A report by China International Capital Corp. predicted that Moutai will raise the price of a flagship baijiu by 15% next year.",

Net income rose almost 3 percent to 8.97 billion yuan.While the liquor giant has so far benefited from its leadership position in the luxury segment, the company could face headwinds from a downturn in consumer sentiment. China\u2019s economy, which in the most recent quarter grew at its slowest pace since the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2009, is facing worsening trade tensions and a slumping stock market.\u201cSlower economic growth in China could hurt sales and earnings growth in the coming 12 months,\u201d Shen Li and Kai Tung Pang, analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a note before the earnings announcement. \u201cWeaker consumer sentiment associated with the property market and trade war may slow demand for luxury goods such as Moutai, and hinder the company\u2019s ability to raise prices in 2019.\u201dIn the third quarter, Moutai\u2019s sales were boosted by two Chinese public holidays, traditional peak periods for baijiu demand. Its inventory remains scarce, which helps prop up demand for its fiery grain liquor even as other luxury companies say that Chinese demand is ebbing as consumer confidence wanes.The premium alcohol is the toast of choice among China\u2019s leaders and has found widespread popularity among the country\u2019s middle class as they embrace a more affluent lifestyle. A bottle of its core brand, Flying Fairy, routinely fetches more than 2,000 yuan in shops, although the company recommends a retail price of 1,499 yuan. Bloomberg",

What distinguishes it from other Chinese small towns is that it produces a famous brand of Chinese liquor Moutai, which often served on official occasions and at state banquets.The spirit, made from sorghum and wheat, takes up to five years for the whole production process, involving nine times of steaming, eight times of fermentation and seven times of distillation, before aged in clay pots.
