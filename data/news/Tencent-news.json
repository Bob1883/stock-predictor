The investors include smartphone maker Xiaomi (1810.HK) and other investment firms, it added.China's craze over generative AI has triggered a flurry of product and fundraising announcements from startups and tech giants, as the industry races to find a homegrown rival to Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT. Investors have warned, however, that a shakeout is imminent as cost and profit pressures grow.Founded by Wang Xiaochuan, founder of internet search engine Sogou Inc, Baichuan was one of the first companies to receive China's approval to release a public chatbot in late August.Shunwei Capital, a venture capital firm chaired by Xiaomi's chief executive Lei Jun, participated in the capital raise, according to a source familiar with the matter.Baichuan declined to comment. Shunwei did not immediately respond to a Reuters query for comment.Baidu (9888.HK) on Tuesday unveiled the newest version of its generative AI model, Ernie 4.0, saying its capabilities were on par with OpenAI's pioneering GPT-4 model, but analysts cautioned the launch lacked major highlights versus the previous version.Reporting by Josh Ye in Hong Kong and Roxanne Liu in Beijing; Editing by Jason Neely and Emelia Sithole-MatariseOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

REUTERS/David Kirton/File Photo Acquire Licensing RightsHONG KONG, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The Chinese government has taken a \"golden share\" in a domestic subsidiary of tech giant Tencent Holdings (0700.HK), a company registration database showed, the latest sign of China stepping up its control over its tech sector.Wangtou Zhicheng, an entity controlled by the Chinese government, now owns a 1% stake in Shenzhen Yayue Technology after an investment of 600,000 yuan ($82,016.51), according to database Qichacha, which said the deal happened on Oc. 18.Tencent, the world's largest video game company and the operator of the WeChat messaging platform, declined to comment.The Information first reported Wangtou Zhicheng's investment in Shenzhen Yayue. Wangtou Zhicheng is owned by the China Internet Investment Fund, which was established by China's cyberspace regulator and finance ministry.It marks the continuation of a trend that has seen Chinese government-backed funds or companies take an about 1% stake in key subsidiaries of data-rich companies such as ByteDance and Alibaba Group (9988.HK).These stakes, known as \"golden shares\", sometimes involve a board seat or other rights, allow the government to gain access to online data and monitor these companies' business activities.Shenzhen Yayue Technology, whose business involves information technology and internet services, was previously 100% owned by a Tencent subsidiary before the stake change took place on Wednesday, according to Qichacha. Pony Ma, chairman of Tencent, controls the subsidiary.Beijing's moves to scoop up golden shares in tech companies, which started more than five years ago, have also raised alarm among foreign governments about China's surveillance of online data and potential intervention in private enterprises.Reuters reported earlier this year that China has acquired minority stakes with special rights in two domestic units of Alibaba.The Financial Times first reported Beijing's plan to acquire a golden share in a Tencent subsidiary earlier this year. However, it can take a year or longer for evidence of this to publicly appear on company registers.Reuters reported that ByteDance, owner of TikTok and its Chinese sister app Douyin, agreed to the government taking a golden share at one of its China subsidiaries in late 2019, a year and a half before the stake in the unit was registered.In the case of ByteDance, the Chinese government took a board seat in Beijing ByteDance Technology with its 1% stake.($1 = 7.3156 Chinese yuan renminbi)Reporting by Josh Ye; Editing by Brenda Goh and Miral FahmyOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

Investors remain cautious that broad global selling of Chinese assets and a sputtering economy will remain key pressure points.\u201cThat the stock has underperformed is really emblematic of the investor disillusionment with China,\u201d said Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee. \u201cTencent stock can start outperforming only when investor confidence in China returns.\u201dIn total, Tencent has spent $4 billion in buybacks and another $20 billion across cash dividends and distributed shares in food-delivery firm Meituan, according to Bloomberg calculations.Shares of the company gained as much as 1.1% on Tuesday as Apple Inc.\u2019s Tim Cook showed up at a Tencent gaming tournament in China, endorsing one of the biggest earners on the app store. It ended the Hong Kong session up 0.3%.There are clear reasons why investors are concerned. Tencent\u2019s fintech and business services segment, which accounts for about one-third of total revenue, likely grew at a slower pace last quarter as offline payment volumes were hit by slower retail sales, according to HSBC Holdings Plc\u2019s Charlene Liu. The bank also trimmed its 2023 games revenue growth forecast given contribution from new launches may take longer to ramp up.Story continuesStill, optimism is slowly building among some analysts as Tencent shifts its business mix toward higher-margin segments such as mini-games and video accounts, while reducing exposure to its less profitable video-streaming business. The recent boost in share buybacks may also provide some price support even as its biggest shareholder trims its stake, according to Morgan Stanley.Tencent\u2019s forward earnings forecast is at a historic high and the company\u2019s shares remain the most recommended in Asia. The stock has 67 buy recommendations and zero sell ratings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Even so, the analysts\u2019 bullishness is being overshadowed by broader macro concerns and rising global yields. A subdued domestic inflation print released Friday and the lackluster data on spending during the Golden Week holiday suggests the turning point is still far away.\u201cFund flows remain unfavorable toward China, which will continue to affect Tencent\u2019s ability to outperform as a high-beta name,\u201d Paul Pong, managing director at Pegasus Fund Managers Ltd. \u201cThe inflection point for the company will appear when the US yield stops rising and China\u2019s economy bottoms out.\u201dTech Chart of the DayThe Nasdaq 100\u2019s rally paused in late summer, but its valuation has slipped more sharply since its July high.

As a keynote speaker in the event\u2019s Media Mastermind series, Tencent Vice President and CEO of Tencent Video, Zhonghuai Sun, told the gathering of top content creators, distributors and broadcasters that \u201cgood content transcends borders\u201d while highlighting opportunities for international partnerships in content and streaming.Tencent Vice President and CEO of Tencent Video, Zhonghuai Sun.Thanks to Internet and AI technology, online video users in China have surged over the last decade to over a billion in 2023. The market has become more sophisticated and competitive with discerning Chinese audiences demanding content of ever higher quality that both entertains and informs. As a result, major platforms have shifted strategies in recent years. They are buying less third-party content and creating original content in-house. Tencent Video has been a trailblazer in this process. Today, it self-produces a diverse range of content from popular drama series to variety shows, feature films, animation, sports, and documentaries to satisfy a diverse user base.As Sun put it, \u201cTencent aims to be a leader in video entertainment, driven by art and technology. We value the essential role of artists and creators and have developed a long-term strategy to develop and protect intellectual property (IP). At the same time, as a part of the bigger Tencent group, we are focused on cutting-edge technological innovations, especially in audiovisual advancement.\u201dFrom the perspective of art, Tencent Video is adept at the innovative application of IP assets, whether self-owned or acquired from external creators, to develop new storylines and additional content in varying formats. One example is the leveraging of Tencent\u2019s legendary Honor of Kings mobile game to produce a successful TV series and a novel. Indeed, Sun noted that currently, well-made content in the fantasy and science fiction genres are particularly popular among Chinese viewers.Tencent Video offers a vast range of content spanning across drama series, variety shows, films, animation, sports, and documentaries. Our content is centered on building a robust IP portfolio. Our vision is to create more IPs with broad influence and to establish a more diverse content ecosystem.Inspiration is also drawn from international markets. As a world-renowned IP, Three-Body is known for being difficult to adapt to film and TV. We spent seven years working on this IP to bring this story to full fruition. Finally, this year, the first installment of the series reached audiences around the world and won the Magnolia award for best art direction, one of the most prestigious awards for Chinese TV dramas. It has also pioneered the sci-fi genre for China\u2019s TV drama segment, which is very exciting for us.Three-Body, a world-renowned IP.Notwithstanding, Chinese viewers are still able to enjoy a wide variety of international programming including imported movies, drama series, variety shows, animation, sports events, and documentaries. Some new developments at Tencent Video include a multi-year partnership with Formula 1\u00aeto stream races and an agreement with the UK\u2019s Coolabi Productions Limited to develop and distribute its famous Warrior Cats content.When it comes to technology, Tencent\u2019s different business units together offer a wealth of digital capabilities. This gives Tencent Video access to invaluable resources such as the company\u2019s social platforms, Tencent Cloud and AI generated content (AIGC) to create an optimal environment for IP collaboration and development.\u201cTechnological innovation has been a key to the success of China\u2019s online video industry,\u201d Sun pointed out. \u201cNew technologies help creators unleash their imagination and bring more immersive aesthetic experiences to users. \u201d\u201cThe content and entertainment industry is standing at the cusp of the AI era. Tencent is ready to support creative partners with a new toolkit that includes our new \u2018Hunyuan\u2019 Chinese large language model (LLM) and enhanced AIGC-based capabilities to create 3D and 2D animated programs. Our aim is to free creators from mundane, repetitive tasks to focus on advancing their art and creating quality content which can be appreciated not only by Chinese audiences but also viewers elsewhere in the world.\u201dTencent Video programming is distributed and promoted outside China through its international version, WeTV. Featuring over 10,000 hours of Chinese-language programming translated into 10 languages, WeTV can currently be seen in over 100 countries and regions. It is one of the most popular streaming platforms in Southeast Asia. The service has also garnered 50 million subscribers on YouTube and nearly 40 million followers on Facebook.\u201cRemaining focused on the dual drivers of art and technology, Tencent Video looks forward to continuing its in-depth cooperation with international partners. The content industry is rich with potential and new possibilities. Sharing opportunities and overcoming new challenges together, we will forge a pathway for the future of the industry to entertain and inform viewers in China and around the world,\u201d Sun concluded.",

            "description": "Tencent Holdings (TCEHY -0.22%) and Alibaba Group Holding (BABA -1.02%) are two of the biggest tech companies in China. Tencent owns WeChat, the country's largest mobile-messaging platform and super app, and it's the world's largest video game publisher. Alibaba owns the country's largest e-commerce and cloud infrastructure platforms.Tencent's WeChat Pay holds a near-duopoly in China's digital payments market along with AliPay, which is owned by Alibaba's fintech affiliate Ant Group. Tencent and Alibaba also each operate their own streaming-video and music platforms.Tencent and Alibaba were once considered conservative ways for overseas investors to profit from China's economic growth. But over the past three years, Tencent's stock has declined nearly 50%, while Alibaba's stock plunged more than 70%. Let's see why these two Chinese tech stalwarts lost their luster, and if either one is still worth buying today.Tencent's high-growth days are overTencent's revenue rose 28% in 2020, but grew just 16% in 2021 and declined 1% in 2022. That slowdown was caused by three main headwinds.First, its gaming business struggled as Chinese regulators froze new video game approvals for about nine months in 2020 and 2021. The regulators also further tightened their draconian playtime restrictions for minors. Those measures forced Tencent to rely on aging games like Honor of Kings in China while ramping up its expansion into overseas markets.Second, its advertising segment suffered a slowdown as China's COVID lockdowns and other macro headwinds drove businesses to buy fewer ads. Competition from other platforms like ByteDance's TikTok worsened that pain.Third, the headwinds drove consumers to make fewer purchases with WeChat Pay and led companies to rein in their spending on Tencent Cloud. The cloud segment also faced stiff competition from Alibaba Cloud, Huawei Cloud, and Baidu AI Cloud in China's crowded cloud infrastructure market.At the same time, China's antitrust regulators curbed the company's ability to expand its ecosystem by closely scrutinizing its investments and acquisitions.Analysts expect Tencent's revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to rise 7% and 24%, respectively, this year as some of the headwinds wane. Its high-growth days might be over, but its stock looks cheap at 16 times forward earnings.Alibaba is rebooting its businessAlibaba's revenue rose 41% in fiscal 2021 (which ended in March 2021), but only grew 19% in fiscal 2022 and a mere 2% in fiscal 2023. That slowdown can be attributed to intense headwinds.Alibaba's troubles started in late 2021, when China's antitrust regulators hit it with a record $2.8 billion fine and imposed new restrictions on its e-commerce business. Those new restrictions -- which barred it from locking in merchants with exclusive deals, using loss-leading promotions to gain new customers, and expanding its ecosystem with unapproved investments -- eroded its defenses against formidable competitors like JD.com and PDD Holdings.At the same time, economic headwinds drove Alibaba's shoppers to make fewer purchases on its online marketplaces while causing businesses to spend less money on its cloud services.The slowdown drove Alibaba to restructure its sprawling business into six new divisions earlier this year, which would allow each unit to operate independently, pursue its own funding from external investors, and potentially go public through an initial public offering (IPO). Alibaba plans to spin off the cloud division as a stand-alone company through an IPO before May 2024, with possible IPOs for its other units in the future.That restructuring could allow each business to expand more efficiently and convince the antitrust regulators to back off, but won't resolve the company's most pressing issues. Analysts expect Alibaba's revenue and adjusted EPS to grow 8% and 19%, respectively, in fiscal 2024 as the macro environment improves. And shares still look dirt cheap at 9 times forward earnings.The better buy: AlibabaTencent and Alibaba could both remain out of favor as long as Chinese stocks might be delisted from U.S. exchanges. The constant threat of government crackdowns and fines could make them even less appealing.That said, I believe Alibaba is still a better buy than Tencent for four reasons: It isn't exposed to the sluggish Chinese video game market, it's better diversified, its upcoming IPOs could generate plenty of cash, and its stock is a lot cheaper relative to its long-term growth potential.",

            "description": "One of the biggest displays at Gamescom 2023 was the Level Infinite booth.Actually, booth might be an understatement \u2014 it was a full stage decked with colorful lighting, complete with segmented gaming areas, and elaborate backdrops with plenty of Instagram-worthy photo opportunities.Established in 2021 by Tencent Games, Level Infinite is the Chinese company\u2019s international game publishing arm. At the showcase, they introduced established and new IPs made in collaboration with studios and developers around the world.Credit: ONE EsportsDuring our time at Gamescom in Cologne, ONE Esports got the chance to connect with Level Infinite Senior Director of Marketing, Anthony Crouts, to find out more about what the brand stands for and how they\u2019re thinking about the future.What does Level Infinite do?Level Infinite is an international game publishing brand owned by Tencent.Most gamers would be familiar with the mobile MOBA Arena of Valor, the international version of Honor of Kings, which operates under them.Besides publishing games, the company works with a network of developers and gaming studios globally, offering services and resources, tapping on Tencent\u2019s deep experience in the industry.How Level Infinite works with studios and game developers to produce high quality gamesThe company sees itself as the \u201cconnective tissue\u201d between studios, as Anthony put it, a place where there\u2019s robust sharing of ideas and upholding of standards, all while raising the bar.\u201cThey can tap in a whole network of resources now and say, hey, we need help with our messaging. Hey, we need help with coming up with community. Hey, we need help with our user acquisition marketing,\u201d he said.Credit: Level InfiniteLevel Infinite is here to support these studios and developers so that they can free resources up to make great content.\u201cThey know that we have their back. We help them with their messaging, with the showcase, and getting the word out, putting them on stage,\u201d Anthony continued.Even well-established IPs like Assassin\u2019s Creed are coming to mobile under the Level Infinite umbrella. The brand-new China-based story held its closed beta in August, and ONE Esports had the chance to try it out firsthand at Gamescom.\u201cWe don\u2019t take it lightly. We have to put our best efforts forward because we\u2019re working on a high class, high-quality IP and we want to make sure that\u2019s reflected in what we create,\u201d Anthony added. \u201cAssassin\u2019s Creed Jade has its own story for mobile. That happened because we are really the best in class at creating those mobile experiences, not just mobile games \u2014 mobile experiences.\u201dHow Level Infinite differentiates itself from the competitionIt\u2019s no surprise then that the first pillar that Level Infinite operates on is quality. They ensure that they make great content at every juncture.\u201cWe have very stringent best practices and guidelines. We establish how we engage with the studios all the way down to the mundane,\u201d said Anthony. \u201cI believe in having a brand marketing point of contact and a studio contact in the same box, called a two in a box management style.\u201dCredit: Level InfiniteThe reason he places a lot of importance on two in a box is because through experience \u2014 having worked at Konami, Sony, Nexon, and Electronic Arts \u2014 he knows that \u201cthere\u2019s always this invisible wall between marketing and product development.\u201d He bridges the gap by ensuring that there\u2019s an open channel of communication to create transparency between teams.On a personal level, his passion pursuits have also unequivocally supported his professional career, shaping his management style. He\u2019s always loved playing games and owns every system that has come out since he was a child, which is why his motto is: if it\u2019s a game, I played it. If it\u2019s a bad game, I only played it once.\u201cDevelopers love that about me. They have a marketer who\u2019s played all the games and thinks like a developer. They can have a conversation with me about game development and game evolution,\u201d said Anthony.The second key pillar Level Infinite operates on is diversity, where they ensure they hit all platforms, genres, and demographics. The third pillar is innovation. They want to drive the gaming industry instead of being a follower, setting trends, and taking the first step forward.\u201cWe demonstrated consistently that we can make high-quality games, that we can be diverse in our content,\u201d said Anthony. \u201cWe\u2019re on every platform, reaching all the different parts of the world. We have created gaming systems \u2014 this is how games play because of the system that we create, and we really deliver.\u201dDiscuss stories like these with us \u2014 join the ONE Esports Discord community.READ MORE: Are gaming laptops good for school?

            "description": "As an investor its worth striving to ensure your overall portfolio beats the market average. But the risk of stock picking is that you will likely buy under-performing companies. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Tencent Holdings Limited ( ) shareholders, since the share price is down 43% in the last three years, falling well short of the market decline of around 9.8%.It's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two. So let's do just that.While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the unfortunate three years of share price decline, Tencent Holdings actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 24% per year. This is quite a puzzle, and suggests there might be something temporarily buoying the share price. Or else the company was over-hyped in the past, and so its growth has disappointed.It's worth taking a look at other metrics, because the EPS growth doesn't seem to match with the falling share price.The modest 0.7% dividend yield is unlikely to be guiding the market view of the stock. We note that, in three years, revenue has actually grown at a 8.3% annual rate, so that doesn't seem to be a reason to sell shares. This analysis is just perfunctory, but it might be worth researching Tencent Holdings more closely, as sometimes stocks fall unfairly. This could present an opportunity.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).Tencent Holdings is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Tencent Holdings willWhat About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Tencent Holdings the TSR over the last 3 years was -38%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Tencent Holdings has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 20% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 3% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Tencent Holdings better, we need to consider many other factors.

            "description": "This article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly on October 2, 2023 - October 8, 2023IN the early 1980s, economic reforms introduced by former Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping resulted in Shenzhen becoming China\u2019s first special economic zone because of its proximity to Hong Kong, attracting foreign direct investment and migrants searching for opportunities.Forty years on, Shenzhen is now a thriving metropolis and long-held symbol of China\u2019s reform and liberalisation, having transformed from a quiet fishing village into a sprawling industrial and financial megacity.Located just about 30km from recently rain-battered Hong Kong, which suffered its worst flash flooding in 140 years, Shenzhen did not escape the chaos caused by the extreme weather either.Amid the storm, Shenzhen\u2019s towering skyscrapers illuminated by rain gave the city a cyberpunk aura reminiscent of Blade Runner, the iconic science-fiction film directed by Ridley Scott in 1982.While Blade Runner\u2019s flying cars may still be a dream for the future, electric vehicles such as Tesla and BYD can already be spotted everywhere on the streets of Shenzhen, a city widely regarded as China\u2019s Silicon Valley.With a population of more than 17.7 million, the bustling tech hub is also home to Hong Kong-listed Chinese internet and gaming giant Tencent Holdings Ltd, which operates China\u2019s killer app Weixin and developed the popular first-person shooter video game, Call of Duty: Mobile.On Sept 7, the Shenzhen-based Tencent officially unveiled its proprietary large foundation model, dubbed \u201cHunyuan\u201d, for business use.By integrating its capabilities with Tencent\u2019s existing products for video conferencing and social media, Hunyuan \u2014 a ChatGPT-like artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbot \u2014 is now open to enterprises in China for testing and building apps via application programming interfaces (APIs) on Tencent Cloud.The name \u201cHunyuan\u201d (\u00bb\u00ec\u00d4\u00aa) in Chinese culture represents the primordial state of the universe, as well as the emergence of the elements and forms of life. It is named with the intention of reflecting its vast knowledge and semantic understanding capabilities.Tencent\u2019s newly launched chatbot is in compliance with new Chinese regulations on generative AI, which came into effect on Aug 15.In contrast to many other nations, China mandates that companies must undergo security assessments and obtain clearance before introducing mass-market AI products. Previously, businesses were restricted to conducting limited public tests of their AI products.However, in response to the growing importance of AI as a competitive focal point to the US, authorities in China recently ramped up efforts to bolster companies engaged in AI development.Under the new rules, prior government authorisation is no longer required for products targeted at businesses. In the past few weeks, Chinese companies such as Baidu Inc and SenseTime Group Inc have been granted approval to introduce AI-powered chatbots to the public.Over in the US on Sept 25, Amazon.com announced plans to invest up to US$4 billion (RM18.7 billion) cash in Anthropic \u2014 a San Francisco-based AI start-up founded by former executives of OpenAI, upping the ante in the AI war.Meanwhile, following the blockbuster listing of its chip design unit Arm Holdings Plc in mid-September, Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp is also reportedly looking for deals in AI, including a potential investment in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT.Avoiding \u2018red ocean\u2019In recent years, although Tencent continues to improve on its stronghold of consumer internet services, it has also been leveraging its strength in video games and social media to actively grow its ecosystem. This has led it to explore the global cloud market, and offer relevant industry vertical business solutions in China and other parts of the world.In a small group media interview at Tencent Binhai Mansion \u2014 the conglomerate\u2019s twin-skyscraper global headquarters in the Nanshan District \u2014 Tencent senior executive vice-president Dowson Tong highlights that Hunyuan features strong Chinese language processing abilities and advanced logical reasoning, and comes with reliable task execution abilities.Tong, who is also CEO of Cloud and Smart Industries Group (CSIG), points out that Hunyuan empowers enterprises to build powerful tools and apps with it, in addition to training their own unique large models derived from Tencent\u2019s Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) offering.\u201cWe strategically choose specific industries with a focus on addressing our customer needs. By avoiding saturated \u2018red ocean\u2019 markets, such as chatbots, we [focus] our efforts on offering services in areas like video conferencing and online document repositories, with large model capabilities, ensuring a targeted and effective approach to AI implementation,\u201d he stresses.Tong reiterates that AI will continue to be a key driver for cloud growth, with increasing demand for enterprises to build and train their own models.\u201cOverall, AI is not just one single product but a great capability that can be leveraged and instrumented into different applications to serve different business scenarios. AI capabilities enhance productivity in various use cases.\u201cFor example, users can benefit from AI-generated meeting minutes, which can summarise an hour-long conversation within just 10 seconds, and this efficient feature significantly enhances enterprise user productivity,\u201d he says, noting that Tencent operates its own video conference platform called Tencent Meeting.Malaysia could be bigger market for TencentTong points out that Malaysia is an important market for Tencent, with a local team serving the digital technology needs of enterprise customers.\u201cIn the financial sector, we see opportunities in database solutions, public cloud and on-premise cloud solutions. Video solutions and media services also present potential growth areas,\u201d he says.While Tencent currently does not have a data centre in Malaysia, Tong acknowledges that some of its customers plan to have a graphics processing unit (GPU) computing operations in specific countries, including Malaysia.\u201cWe will continue to monitor and consider expanding our services and coverage in response to customer demand for cloud services. To address traditional sectors in Malaysia, we rely on partners who understand the region, specific countries, and particular industries, enabling us to better meet their needs,\u201d he says.Tong says many of Tencent\u2019s customers have data centres in Singapore, but owning a data centre in the city state is \u201cactually pretty expensive\u201d in terms of cost of electricity, not to mention the limitation on further expansion.\u201cWe have heard from our customers who are asking for an alternative. Malaysia, being close to their regional hubs, definitely has a unique advantage,\u201d he says.Tencent organised Tencent Media Connect Day and Tencent Global Digital Ecosystem Summit 2023 \u2014 its annual flagship conference \u2014 between Sept 5 and 8 in Shenzhen.Talk to my handMalaysia\u2019s tech companies can learn from the manner in which the Chinese tech giants have cultivated robust ecosystems \u2014 a feature that truly sets them apart from the rest.While Malaysia boasts e-hailing, e-payment and restaurant apps, China\u2019s tech solutions offer a seamless experience that eliminates the need for constant app-switching and separate logins. Tencent\u2019s diverse digital ecosystem spans crucial verticals such as cloud, social communications, payment services and entertainment.And, now, the latest in hand is palm-scanning payment, which is proving to be a game-changer. With this innovation, payment headaches caused by dead batteries become a thing of the past.In a move that feels straight out of a sci-fi movie, Weixin Pay has introduced palm print-based technology for power bank rentals in Shenzhen\u2019s Coastal City, starting from Sept 5.When your smartphone decides to take a break, you might find yourself unable to rent a power bank using your e-wallet (unless you have smartwatches or credit cards at hand, of course).That is where palm payment steps in, enabling cashless transactions even when you have left your wallet, credit card or smartwatch behind.Essentially, your palm becomes the key to a world of convenience.Shenzhen\u2019s embrace of technology epitomises China\u2019s cutting-edge spirit, where futuristic visions are transformed into everyday reality. In fact, Weixin Pay has played a pioneering role in China\u2019s \u201cmobile-first\u201d society.The mobile payment and digital wallet service provider works with local merchants across the region to onboard them on the Weixin ecosystem to provide its users with a seamless payment ecosystem and experience.This includes popular travel destinations frequented by Chinese tourists, such as Southeast Asia. In addition to Mainland China, Weixin Pay is also available in 69 countries and regions.Weixin Pay International Business marketing director Monica Zheng believes one of the main reasons that Weixin Pay is so successful is that Weixin has a \u201cvery powerful ecosystem\u201d.\u201cTo us, as long as there is e-payment demand for Mainland Chinese in a foreign country, Weixin Pay has a good chance to be successful there. If you look at what we have done in China and some other countries, Weixin has become a contactless tool for restaurant patrons to view menus, order and pay with a snap of their smartphones.\u201cDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, the cross-borders and local merchants had rushed to the e-commerce ecosystem. Our Weixin ecosystem enables them to maximise their profits,\u201d she says.Mobile gaming and esports rising in popularityApart from operating Weixin \u2014 a widely used messaging and payments app in China \u2014 and its sister app WeChat \u2014 designed for overseas users \u2014 Tencent is also one of the world\u2019s largest video game vendors.Notable game titles under Tencent in Southeast Asia include PUBG Mobile, Valorant, League of Legends, Teamfight Tactics, Call of Duty: Mobile and Arena of Valor.In 2021, Tencent launched its global gaming brand dubbed Level Infinite to deliver its engaging interactive entertainment experiences to a worldwide audience.Level Infinite senior director of marketing Anthony Crouts foresees the gaming and esports landscape evolving significantly in the coming years, with a strong focus on content and the implementation of esports features.\u201cOur approach is to concentrate on our strengths and strive for innovation, rather than merely competing with others. By conducting user testing and gathering insights from our audience, we aim to stay ahead of the curve and lead the industry as trailblazers,\u201d he says.Crouts adds that Level Infinite\u2019s focus is on identifying and promoting good games, regardless of their origin.\u201cThere is certainly potential for a video game and mobile gaming development industry in Malaysia, and Level Infinite could play a significant role in fostering such development if we identify the right opportunities.\u201dSave by subscribing to us for your print and/or digital copy.",

            "description": "One of the best strategies in stock investing is simply to buy good stocks and hold them for the long term.This works because while there will be short-term fluctuations and periodic extended market downturns, historical data shows that in the U.S. market, stock prices generally rise over long periods. And this is especially true for well-run companies that can continue to deliver value to stakeholders.Besides, a buy-and-hold strategy sidesteps the need for market timing -- and attempting to time the market by buying low and selling high is notoriously tricky. With that in mind, here are two well-established tech companies that investors can buy and hold for the next five years.1. Tencent: A leading tech conglomerate in ChinaThe first company is one of the largest tech companies in China: Tencent Holdings Limited (TCEHY -0.22%).The conglomerate has an extensive business empire covering areas such as social media networking, gaming, entertainment, fintech, and cloud computing. While it started mainly as an online messaging service company (QQ), it has expanded over the years to become one of the largest companies in China thanks to its twin strategies of building businesses and investing in leading technology companies.In the former, Tencent leverages its massive user base (1.3 billion per the latest earnings report) of its flagship social media networking and communication app, WeChat, to launch an array of services in gaming, fintech, and entertainment. This strategy improves user engagement and retention, and has helped grow Tencent's revenue and profitability over the long run.Tencent's success has resulted in enormous cash flow generation, which it redirects into the second part of its growth engine -- investing in other companies. For instance, Tencent helped Pinduoduo to grow by infusing cash and directing user traffic to it in return for a stake in the company. Tencent did similar things with Meituan and Sea Limited.Tencent's success is evident in its financials. Since going public in 2004, Tencent revenue has grown by more than 500-fold to 555 billion yuan in 2022. While it is already a large company, it can grow further, leveraging its management's capital allocation skills and WeChat's dominant position in messaging and social media. In other words, the twin-growth engine remains relevant today despite its size.Still, like all investments, there are risks involved, and one of the most prominent investors should note is the political and regulatory risk of investing in Chinese companies. For instance, the Chinese government fined Tencent around 2.99 billion yuan in July this year as the crackdown on technology companies since 2020 has come closer to an end. Unfortunately, investors have no choice but to accept that politics can interfere with the business affairs of major companies in China.I think the potential reward of owning Tencent's stock outweighs the downside of the political risks. So, for those willing to accept that risk, buying and holding Tencent's stock for the next five years could be financially rewarding.2. Amazon: A leading tech giant in the U.S. and beyondThe following company is a household name and e-commerce giant, Amazon (AMZN -0.47%). From its origins as an online bookstore, Amazon has evolved into a diversified tech giant with business spanning cloud computing, digital advertising, entertainment, and more.In e-commerce, Amazon is the U.S. leader, with around 38% of the e-commerce market share. Its success in this business stems from its intensive focus on customer delight. To this end, it offers arguably the most extensive online shopping catalog, a low-price strategy, and a wide range of services -- fast delivery and Amazon Prime membership -- to attract and retain its customers.While Amazon started its business with consumer-facing customers, it has expanded into the enterprise business via Amazon Web Services (AWS), which has, over the years, grown into a global leader in cloud computing. In the second quarter of 2023, Statista estimates that AWS held a 32% market share in the worldwide cloud computing infrastructure market, a 10% lead over Azure Cloud at 22%.Amazon's achievement to date has been remarkable, but its success brings some potential risks. For example, The Federal Trade Commission recently sued Amazon, alleging that the technology company is a monopolist that uses anticompetitive and unfair strategies to maintain its monopoly power illegally. Amazon responded that the FTC's lawsuit would lead to higher prices, slower consumer deliveries, and hurt businesses .Still, I think the pros far outweigh the cons regarding Amazon stock. For instance, the company believes it is still day one and has much more to achieve in the years to come. This day-one mentality underscores Amazon's culture: always experimenting with the latest ideas, innovating to bring new products and services, and relentlessly focusing on customer delight. With such a culture in place, the tech company is set to keep its growth machine intact for years to come.Besides, there are external tailwinds that Amazon can leverage to sustain its growth machine. For instance, the migration to the cloud trend will continue for years, if not decades. And with the artificial intelligence (AI) development, AWS is set to grow for the foreseeable future. Similarly, the e-commerce business can continue to grab retail market share in the US and expand in fast-growing overseas markets like India.In short, I think Amazon is well-positioned to become a more valuable company in the next five years.",

            "description": "This was either a teenage gamer\u2019s dream or their parents\u2019 worst nightmare, depending on who you ask. But it\u2019s real: For the first time in history, e-sports is an official, medal-earning event at the Asian Games, the continent\u2019s regional version of the Olympics, which opened last week. Over 20 countries competed in seven e-sports games.What\u2019s wild to me is that these events are attracting more interest than the Asian Games\u2019 traditional sports. Of all the competitions taking place, e-sports is the only one in which arena tickets were sold on a lottery basis because of skyrocketing demand. There were over 5 million lottery entrants for all the e-sports events; each had a 0.5% chance of getting a ticket.If you do not spend much time in Asia, this might be something of a surprise.\u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that Asia is the leading region for e-sports right now,\u201d says Daniel Ahmad, the director of research and insights at Niko Partners, a gaming analytics company. \u201cOur previous studies have found that gamers in Asia are more motivated by competition, alongside completion, challenge, and community, when compared to the West.\u201dChina is really the leader here. In fact, it\u2019s the largest e-sports market in the world, accounting for 34% of global industry revenue in that category, according to market research by Niko Partners; Asia combined takes 53%.Within China, e-sports are run like any popular sport and have been for a long time: there are regional clubs, each with its home stadium; tournaments featuring different tiers of talent make it possible for the industry to evaluate the players (and also for the players to make a living); and in recent years, star players have even been marketed like celebrities, attracting cultish fan groups.And as the industry\u2019s popularity soars, the fan base is growing beyond the groups you probably picture when you think e-sports fan. According to a 2022 survey done by CADPA, a Chinese industry association with government backing, e-sports have nearly as many fans in the 35-to-44 age group as among those under 24. Women and people from the country\u2019s smallest towns also make up 44% and 36% of the fan base, respectively.",

            "description": "Chinese Scientists Are Combating a Glacier's Melting By Covering It With a Blanketby Esha Karam | October 5, 2023One of China\u2019s most-visited glaciers in the Tibetan region, the Dagu Glacier, is now covered with white sheets , also known as geotextiles, in an attempt to slow its melting. Scientists at Nanjing University are leading the effort, and in July installed a white reflective material over 400 square meters of the glacier, located in Sichuan province in southwestern China.The project begins as the Dagu, one of the largest glacier tourism sites in China, as well as other glaciers around China face severe melting due to rising temperatures. In the past 50 years, glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau, where the Dagu is located, have shrunk by about 15 percent , according to research from the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.The effort is funded by video game giant Tencent Holdings\u2019 Carbon Neutrality Lab , as part of the company\u2019s stated goal to be a leader in encouraging society to develop sustainably. The company says it is committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2030, and seeks to foster sustainable innovation beyond its own goals, according to its website.Although glacier blankets are a novel method of glacier preservation in Tibet, they have been employed in the past, primarily at European ski resorts. At the Rhone Glacier in Switzerland, glacier blankets have been installed seasonally for the last 13 years in an attempt to preserve ski slopes and tourism.In an article published by Tencent , Zhu Bin, a material scientist at Nanjing University leading the effort, said that local communities have welcomed the attempt to preserve the glacier.\u201cWe have received overwhelming support from the local communities over the past years,\u201d Bin said. \u201cThe protection of the glacier is more important than ever as it underpins the entire ecosystem as well as the livelihood of the locals.\u201dThe use of blankets in other regions has come with controversy, as many people have criticized them for their lack of long-term feasibility. Blankets are often hard to scale up, and cannot protect glaciers from the effects of warming for long periods of time.\u201cThey\u2019re a little bit of a desperation measure,\u201d said Mauri Pelto, a professor of environmental science at Nichols College who studies glaciers. \u201cIf you\u2019ve only covered just a tiny part of the glacier, the [rest] is melting. That doesn\u2019t sustain your operation.\u201dThere are also obstacles depending on the region, including the fact that higher elevation glaciers are harder to reach. Combined with the high expenses of the project, many say that geotextiles offer too little, too late.A study published last year in the journal Remote Sensing by researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences showed that a blanket installed over part of the Dagu Glacier was effective at slowing melting, with the covered area showing 15 percent less mass loss than uncovered areas. However, as the study noted, high expenses, harsh geography and aging of textiles limit the feasibility of using blankets in widespread areas. Geotextiles must be manually installed, and many glaciers are in areas that are difficult to reach. Although the textiles used in this project are designed to be eco-friendly, according to researchers , they are still made from materials that create carbon emissions.Although glacier blankets cannot stop melting, some have said that, especially in areas with high tourism, like the Dagu Glacier, they can be effective visual reminders of the impact of climate change. \u201cI think actually ultimately, this is more of a visual reminder to tourists and recreationists that climate change is making an impact in those areas,\u201d said Mark Carey, a historian at the University of Oregon who studies glacier retreat and climate change. \u201cIt\u2019s an educational tool.\u201dResearchers on the project team are aware that glacier blankets can only do so much. \u201cAll the human intervention methods that we\u2019re working on, even if they prove effective, are only going to slow down [the melting],\u201d Bin said. \u201cIf the earth keeps getting warmer, in the end, there is no way to protect the glaciers forever.\u201dEsha Karam is GlacierHub staff writer and a junior at Columbia College studying sustainability and economics.GlacierHub is a climate communication initiative led by Ben Orlove, an anthropologist at the Columbia Climate School.

While Epic Games is technically a privately-owned company, 40% of it is owned by Tencent, which also owns minority stakes in Spotify as well as Warner Records and Universal Records. As Rolling Stone reported in 2020:Tencent Holdings is about to own 10 percent of Universal, which in turns owns around 3.5 percent in Spotify, which in turn owns around nine percent in Tencent Music Entertainment, which in turn is part-owned by Universal's two main rivals (Warner and Sony), but remains majority owned by Tencent Holdings, which in turn owns 9.1 percent of Spotify. (And, yes, no kidding, that's the short version.)One year after the company was bought out by Epic Games, Bandcamp workers announced a union campaign. Two months later \u2014 in May 2023 \u2014 the company announced that the workers had indeed voted to unionize:A majority of eligible Bandcamp workers voted 31-7 in favor of forming Bandcamp United, a union represented by the Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU). The vote results now await certification by the National Labor Relations Board, with a collective bargaining process to follow.There's been no public news about that union negotiation process \u2014 but surely something like a sale and acquisition to an entirely different entity is going to throw it for a loop. How convenient! If I were an idiot, I would think it was a big ol' wacky coincidence! Now, I'm also obliged to remind you that correlation is not causation, but still \u2014 bad look for Epic Games.Anyway. Bandcamp Friday is next week, which is usually a day when the company waives its cut of music sales, so that the artists get to keep a higher percentage. I was hoping to finish up a new track so my band could release it just in time for Bandcamp Friday \u2026 but idunno, I'm kind of feeling shitty about it now.Epic Games is eliminating 16% of its workforce and selling Bandcamp [Ashely Capoot / CNBC]Layoffs at Epic [Epic Games]",

Photo: VCG via Getty ImagesAfter years of fierce rivalry, Alibaba and Tencent started breaking down the virtual walls separating their services in 2021 after the Chinese government doubled on its efforts to break up tech monopolies.While Tencent once limited the sharing of links to Alibaba stores on WeChat, it now lets users open a variety of links and content within its messaging function.However, some digital barriers continue to exist: for example, users still cannot use WeChat Pay for transactions on Taobao, nor use Alipay \u2013 the electronic payments service of Alibaba financial technology affiliate Ant Group \u2013 to pay for goods and services on WeChat mini-programs.Alibaba and Tencent are both trying to navigate their way out of a slowing economy. A drop in China\u2019s consumer prices in July, the first in more than two years, has spurred Beijing on a daunting task to use every tool available in its toolbox to deflate chronic deflationary pressure and avoid the economic stagnation that had plagued Japan for more than a decade.A 1.7 per cent drop in food prices in August, compared with a rise of services prices by 1.3 per cent, indicated an uneven post-Covid-reopening economic recovery in China.Amid uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and rising competition from younger rivals such as ByteDance\u2019s domestic short-video sensation Douyin, Alibaba and Tencent have deepened their partnerships.",

            "description": "Telegram, the popular messaging app with 800 million monthly active users worldwide, is inching closer to adopting an ecosystem strategy that is reminiscent of WeChat\u2019s super app approach. Certain aspects of the ecosystem will be decentralized with help from two heavyweights: Telegram\u2019s crypto partner TON Foundation and WeChat\u2019s owner Tencent.Telegram has been working on a platform where third-party developers, from games to restaurants, can build mini apps to interact with users. In Telegram\u2019s own words: \u201cDevelopers can use JavaScript to create infinitely flexible interfaces that can be launched right inside Telegram \u2014 and can completely replace any website.\u201dTo build out this super app platform, Telegram relies on a network of infrastructure partners both from the established tech world and the crypto space. Among them is The Open Network (TON) Foundation, which lays the blockchain groundwork for Telegram but operates as an independent organization.This week, TON Foundation announced that it\u2019s forged a partnership with Tencent Cloud, which has \u201calready successfully supported TON validators and plans to expand its services further to help meet TON\u2019s high compute intensity and network bandwidth needs.\u201d Validators, in web3 lingo, are participants that help authenticate transactions in a blockchain network.\u201cFor example, Telegram games built on TON can benefit from Tencent Cloud\u2019s enriched gaming solution and reference cases,\u201d the announcement says. \u201cFor all projects built on TON, Tencent Cloud will offer, subject to approval, a dedicated amount of cloud credits and product discounts, made available through the Tencent Cloud Startup Program.\u201dAmid slowing growth in China\u2019s tech industry, Tencent has been stepping up its overseas expansion efforts. In recent months, its cloud computing business has been popping up at tech conventions, including crypto conferences. Tencent could potentially reap great rewards from the partnership if Telegram\u2019s mini-app marketplace takes off like its Chinese counterpart.WeChat has pioneered the mini app model in China and now powers millions of them serving functions from payments, food delivery, e-commerce, and ride-hailing, to driver\u2019s license renewal, just to name a few. With a decentralized payments network, Telegram\u2019s mini-app ecosystem has the potential to reach an even broader spectrum of users around the world.Learning from WeChat\u2019s playbookEven though Tencent Cloud won\u2019t be TON\u2019s exclusive cloud provider according to TechCrunch\u2019s knowledge, it appears that the partners stand to gain from their synergies.\u201cGiven the similarities between WeChat mini apps and Telegram mini apps, we believe that mini app developers from WeChat who are currently using Tencent\u2019s cloud service will begin to build on TON,\u201d Justin Hyun, head of growth at TON Foundation, told TechCrunch.It\u2019s unclear how many developers building for WeChat\u2019s China users are able to capture the diverse needs of Telegram\u2019s international community. Creators of mobile games might have the most transferrable skills, given many of them are already marketing in overseas markets. Given Telegram is blocked in China, many developers will have to familiarize themselves with the app before they can devise meaningful applications for the platform.The developers would also need to learn the programming languages of blockchain apps, which might actually be an easier barrier to overcome than the process of understanding the economic incentives that facilitate decentralized applications.A partnership with Tencent, however, could offer insights into enticing people to use a messenger for a whole array of other purposes. Importantly, payment functionality played a critical role in WeChat\u2019s early rise as it instilled a habit among users to make daily transactions through the chat app.While WeChat makes its in-house payments system the default option and turned it into a cash cow for Tencent, Telegram has integrated with 20 payments solutions and takes no commission through its Bot Payments API. Aside from mature solutions like Google Pay or Apple Pay, Telegram also recently welcomed a self-custodial wallet that is independently developed by The Open Platform (TOP) using the TON blockchain. Having a crypto wallet can potentially bring a wide range of transaction scenarios to regions where centralized online payments aren\u2019t available.It will be fascinating to witness what lessons Telegram and TON take from WeChat and how a mini-app platform with a decentralized twist unfolds.",

This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF (CN\u00a5, Millions) CN\u00a5185.8b CN\u00a5212.4b CN\u00a5214.4b CN\u00a5239.0b CN\u00a5253.0b CN\u00a5264.9b CN\u00a5275.0b CN\u00a5284.0b CN\u00a5292.1b CN\u00a5299.5b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x15 Analyst x13 Analyst x2 Analyst x2 Est @ 5.88% Est @ 4.68% Est @ 3.84% Est @ 3.25% Est @ 2.84% Est @ 2.55% Present Value (CN\u00a5, Millions) Discounted @ 8.7% CN\u00a5170.9k CN\u00a5179.7k CN\u00a5166.9k CN\u00a5171.1k CN\u00a5166.6k CN\u00a5160.4k CN\u00a5153.2k CN\u00a5145.5k CN\u00a5137.6k CN\u00a5129.8k(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = CN\u00a51.6tWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.9%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF 2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = CN\u00a5300b\u00d7 (1 + 1.9%) \u00f7 (8.7%\u2013 1.9%) = CN\u00a54.5tPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= CN\u00a54.5t\u00f7 ( 1 + 8.7%)10= CN\u00a51.9tThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is CN\u00a53.5t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of HK$314, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 22% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.The AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Tencent Holdings as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.127. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Tencent HoldingsStrength Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry. Debt is not viewed as a risk. Weakness Earnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average. Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Interactive Media and Services market. Opportunity Annual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the Hong Kong market. Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value. Threat Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the Hong Kong market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

            "description": "Bob van Dijk, CEO of e-commerce group Naspers, poses for a photograph in front of the company logo after holding a media briefing in Johannesburg, South Africa, October 9, 2019. REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko Acquire Licensing RightsLONDON, Sept 18 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Bob van Dijk is passing an unsolved problem to his successor. The chief executive of Prosus (PRX.AS), Tencent\u2019s (0700.HK) biggest investor, said on Monday he was stepping down. Interim CEO Ervin Tu can suggest more asset sales to boost shareholder returns. But without a plan for his company\u2019s 25% stake in the $380 billion Chinese e-commerce behemoth, Prosus shares\u2019 discount to the value of their underlying assets will remain the elephant in the room.Prosus is an $80 billion Amsterdam-listed vehicle controlled by South Africa\u2019s Naspers (NPNJn.J), since a 2019 spinoff. The Tencent stake that it owns made up about 75% of the group\u2019s $130 billion portfolio value as of Sept. 15. The rest of Prosus\u2019s valuation derives from a roughly 30% stake in $8.5 billion Delivery Hero, plus a mix of listed and unlisted technology startups operating in emerging markets such as India and Brazil.Van Dijk\u2019s perennial problem was that Prosus shares used to stand at a 60% discount relative to the value of its listed Tencent shares and other assets. One of the reasons why it persisted was the huge tax bill that would get triggered if he tried to sell the stake entirely. His workaround was to instead sell little chunks of Tencent shares, and use the proceeds to buy back Prosus stock. A tweak to Naspers and Prosus cross-shareholdings in June also saw the discount fall to 40%, based on share prices on Sept. 15 and the company\u2019s portfolio tracker.Still, the gap reflects shareholders\u2019 ongoing struggles to value Prosus. Investors are better off buying Tencent shares directly. Neither Prosus nor the 50-year-old van Dijk gave a reason for his exit, but the persistence of the discount won\u2019t have helped.It\u2019s not obvious Tu will have any more luck. The former SoftBank Vision Fund and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) dealmaker can suggest more spinoffs of unlisted assets such as Brazilian food delivery firm iFood and India-based payment startup PayU, on the basis that SoftBank\u2019s Arm float may suggest the IPO market is recovering. He can also keep launching buybacks or paying dividends to shareholders to boost returns. But without a concrete plan for the Tencent stake, the discount will remain.Reuters Graphics(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

            "description": "Bob van Dijk Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe immediate and mutually agreed departure of Naspers and Prosus CEO Bob van Dijk underscores a complicated few years for a firm seen riding on the coattails of its holdings in Chinese tech giant, Tencent . In June, the Dutch-based e-commerce investor, Prosus, which is majority-owned by South African multi-national Naspers won shareholder and regulatory approval to unwind its complex ownership structure. The South African Reserve Bank gave Naspers the greenlight to begin buying back more of its shares from Prosus.'Getting rid' of the cross holdingPrior to the current structure, Naspers (headquartered in South Africa) owned a third of Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings. This was an investment made by current chairman and founder of Naspers, Koos Bekker, as early as 2001, when he paid $34 million for a 46.5% stake in the business. Van Dijk oversaw the decision to split off its holding of Tencent and other tech holdings into Prosus in 2019. In the meantime, Tencent's market capitalization rocketed close to $1 trillion as the stock boomed during the Covid-19 pandemic. This meant Naspers made up nearly a quarter of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange which was a problem for some fund managers. Then in 2021, Naspers developed a crossholding using a share swap deal. Prosus issued new shares to buy a 45.4% stake in Naspers, and this effectively moved a slice of Naspers from the Johannesburg exchange to Amsterdam's Euronext. But that crossholding offered little value to investors with van Dijk telling Reuters at the time: \"They [shareholders] said we don't like this cross holding, it creates complexity. We've listened to them. And we're basically getting rid of that now.\"Stepping upOn Monday the business also announced, on a call with investors, that the unwinding of the crossholding had officially been completed with the business now aiming to maintain profitability going into the first half of the 2025 fiscal year. Erwin Tu, Prosus' group chief investment officer has been named interim CEO, with Citi saying in a research note that it sees \"a good chance of him becoming permanent CEO. \"We suspect the decision has not been sudden, but rather one the company preferred to announce following the completion of the unwind of the cross-holding process,\" the Citi analysts said. Tu was previously a managing partner at the SoftBank Vision Fund where he also co-led M&A and corporate finance for SoftBank Group International. He was also managing director in the technology banking group at Goldman Sachs.watch now",

            "description": "More than 4,000 technology-focused individuals from business, academia and the media are gathering in Shenzhen in early September for the Tencent Global Digital Ecosystem Summit (DES). The annual flagship event, now in its fifth year, showcases Tencent\u2019s latest advances in technology coupled with its newest products and solutions. It is also a forum for attendees to hear from the experts and take part in conversations on the opportunities and challenges in the digital transformation of industries and enterprises.Hunyuan Debut \u2013 Large-scale AI Model for IndustryGenerative AI captured the world\u2019s imagination throughout 2023 and carried through to be a hot topic at this year\u2019s summit. Tencent has been firing up all engines and pouring investment into building its own AI capabilities and DES provides the perfect backdrop for the company to officially launch its wholly self-developed, proprietary large-scale AI model named Hunyuan. The Chinese term hunyuan denotes the origin of all things, something that is all encompassing and without limit. Use of the term reflects Tencent\u2019s aim to create a powerful and versatile AI model for the widest of applications.Featuring strong capabilities in Chinese language processing, advanced logical reasoning, and reliable task execution, Hunyuan was developed specifically for business and industry as a key differentiating factor.\u201cDifferent businesses have different needs. In developing chatbots and other AI services, they have to incorporate their own data to train the model so that the answers generated reflect accurate knowledge of their business offerings. As such, a general-purpose AI model may not be able to meet the specific needs of the business community,\u201d explains Dowson Tong, Senior Executive Vice-President of Tencent and CEO of the company\u2019s Cloud & Smart Industries Group.\u201cTencent\u2019s To-Business approach balances the exciting performance of consumer-facing, large-model AI-powered chatbots, with the pragmatic need of businesses to increase operational efficiencies, reduce cost, and, most importantly, protect privacy and proprietary data.\u201dMaaS \u2013 Making AI Accessible to AllCommitted to open collaboration in the ecosystem and promoting industry-specific solutions to support the continued development of AI, Tencent is empowering businesses of all shapes and sizes to tap into AI technology by making Hunyuan available openly through the new Tencent Cloud Model-as-a-Service.Tools are available at three levels with Tencent Cloud providing end-to-end support.The scale and sophistication of Tencent Cloud\u2019s infrastructure and computing power enable clients to obtain Hunyuan from Tencent\u2019s public cloud platform, finetune and train their own uniquely intelligent service models in a secure environment after incorporating their specific, proprietary data.Companies looking for just simple plug and play solutions may choose from more than 50 large-scale models that have been specifically pre-trained and optimized for 20 major industries such as finance, cultural tourism, public services, media, education and more.Ten proprietary applications including Tencent Meeting, Tencent Docs and WeCom/WeChat are fully AI-enabled to improve user experiences. Leveraging Hunyuan\u2019s natural language processing powers, the applications can provide smart services such as creating meeting summaries and pinpointing information providers to facilitate follow-up questions or actions.Tencent Cloud \u2013 Serving at Home and InternationallyOther than AI, DES provides attendees with insights into Tencent and Tencent Cloud\u2019s international capabilities which support Chinese enterprises to grow in overseas markets while facilitating overseas companies to expand into China with a one-stop China Connect solution.The global cloud computing market remains a bright spot. Operating data center facilities in 26 geographic areas on five continents with 70 availability zones, Tencent Cloud posted double digit revenue growth in the first half of 2023. Asia continues to be the most important market, but healthy activity is being recorded in Latin America and the Middle East. With over 11,000 partners worldwide, Tencent Cloud\u2019s Global Partner Ecosystem is a key driving force for its international business. Partner-driven revenue has grown 66 percent year-over-year as of mid-2023.Supporting Digital Transformation of Industry, Serving People and Society\u201cTencent\u2019s innovations are underpinned by the principle that technology serves industry, people, and society effectively. We will continue to collaborate with our partners to support the digital transformation of businesses while harnessing the power of AI to enable businesses to unleash the potential of their data, driving industry innovation to improve people\u2019s quality of life,\u201d Dowson concludes.",

China doesn\u2019t support cryptocurrency or public blockchains, but WeBank is keen to shift from permissioned consortium blockchains to blockchains \u201cwith a public spirit.\u201dWeBank is one of China\u2019s biggest digital only banks and was founded by Tencent, the owner of the pervasive WeChat app. However, its current stake is around 30%.Its permissioned WeBank blockchain has processed more than 400 million transactions and averages 300,000 daily transactions, according to the Shenzhen Securities Times. It has 30 or so blockchain applications.Henry Ma, WeBank\u2019s CIO and EVP, first proposed a \u201cPublic Alliance Chain\u201d in 2018. He sees advantages in an open ecosystem in which anyone can participate. However, he acknowledged that those who like public blockchains are not keen on supervision. On the other hand, permissioned blockchains tend to be more efficient and scalable and \u2013 in the Chinese context \u2013 easier to supervise.His thinking overlaps with the Hedera and Korean Klaytn blockchains, which have open access. However, large corporates participate in the governing Council, and only Council members control the nodes with permission to write data. That\u2019s no longer the case with Klaytn, and both are taking steps to reduce the Council\u2019s role. Unlike Klaytn and Hedera, WeBank\u2019s Ma is not suggesting using a cryptocurrency.To transition to greater openness, WeBank will soon enable light nodes to support read-only access to its blockchain.FISCO BOS in the shadows of HyperledgerWeBank\u2019s blockchain uses the FISCO BCOS blockchain. In 2017, WeBank contributed its own code to found the open source FISCO BCOS blockchain alongside Tencent, Huawei, ZTE and a hundred other Chinese organizations. From the start, the aim was to be coinless and open to the public. It positioned itself as a challenger to enterprise blockchain Hyperledger Fabric.WeBank is still actively developing FISCO BCOS. According to Ma, 4,000 organizations use FISCO BCOS across 300 applications.It was the first blockchain technology supported by the Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN), which also targets a public-like infrastructure. BSN enables SMEs to adopt blockchain in a cost effective manner.Meanwhile, China continues to develop its high performance blockchain, Chang\u2019an Chain or ChainMaker. It claims to process up to 240 million transactions per secon",

            "description": "A small team of scientists from Nanjing University led by Professor Zhu Bin is trying to cover a small area of the Dagu Glacier, located 5,000 meters above sea level in southwestern China, with a thin white sheet of material in an attempt to prevent the glacier from melting. This is another classic case of David versus Goliath. However, the Goliath in this case is not the glacier itself, but rather the effects of global warming that are causing it to melt.Tucked inside snowcapped mountains and primitive forests, Dagu is home to many different plants and animal species. The glacier was only discovered in 1992 through satellite images and it has been a popular tourist destination since the area was opened to visitors in 2010 with around 200,000 visiting the glacier each year. The influx of tourists has brought benefits to the locals of villages living around Dagu but what the future holds for the glacier remains a matter of concern.Dagu is one of the \u2018youngest\u2019 glaciers but it is suffering the same fate as its more mature counterparts around the world. Climate change is causing glaciers to melt at an alarming rate. Millions of years in the making, Dagu has shrunk 70 percent in just a few decades. The situation is dire as the effects of melting cannot be reversed. There is an urgent need for action to prevent the loss of the region\u2019s ecology which the mountain communities depend on.Dagu Glacier changes: July 2005 vs. July 2023.Professor Zhu Bin is a materials scientist, a research area that specializes in the studies of the properties and structure of different materials. He believes he has a solution that will help to slow down the rate of melting on glaciers until a longer-term solution can be found \u2013 radiative cooling with a nano-thin material he developed from eco-friendly cellulose acetate (CA).\u201cThe technology will, on the one hand, deflect the heat from direct sunlight away from the glacier. At the same time, the glacier\u2019s own energy can be radiated outward through the porous material to keep temperatures low and slow down the melting rate,\u201d Professor Zhu explained.Scientists elsewhere have experimented with conservation methods using different types of materials to blanket and insulate glaciers with varying degrees of success. However, Professor Zhu says the new material is different because of its higher reflective rate of over 92 percent compared with 70 percent reached in other initiatives. Also, the technology can radiate energy beyond the earth\u2019s atmosphere into space, resulting in more effective cooling.After obtaining promising data from laboratory experiments on snow, ice and even ice cream, Professor Zhu and his team began conducting tests on glaciers.\u201cIn our controlled experiments, we laid about 200 square meters of material and was able to slow melting by three to four times compared to the rate of melting without the film. When we got the data, we were very excited.\u201dProf. Zhu's team conducted their first experiment in Dagu Glacier in August 2022.The experiment was later replicated on a larger scale at Dagu in August 2022, marking the largest glacier conservation effort to date using the new material. Tencent made the project possible through a sponsorship under its Sustainable Social Value Innovation strategy. The company\u2019s Carbon Neutrality Laboratory is providing practical support.Dr. Hao Xu, head of Tencent\u2019s Carbon Neutrality Laboratory, says: \u201cExtreme weather events are becoming more frequent and intense, highlighting the urgency to address climate change and secure a sustainable future for our world. However, the window of opportunity for action is closing quickly as the glaciers are melting at an alarming rate.\u201d\u201cThe Dagu experiment holds important social and scientific value. The experiment aligns with Tencent\u2019s \u2018Tech for Good\u2019 value by leveraging the power of technology and innovation to create positive social impacts. This alignment inspired Tencent to contribute to this project.\u201d\u201cThe melting glacier can affect our entire ecosystem. The flowers, fauna, lake and every living organism in the entire scenic area will be impacted. Nanjing University\u2019s effort to develop this new, high-tech material to protect glaciers and the environment is motivating. The more people know about it, the more it will help raise awareness on the need to protect our environment. This is a very meaningful project,\u201d said Shihai Huang, Head of Dagu Glacier Management Bureau.In June of this year, Professor Zhu and his team trekked up to Dagu\u2019s icy peak for a second time in 10 months to lay another 400 square meters of the new material and prepared to take measurements.The Dagu Glacier community also offered its full assistance with local villagers assisting the team to haul up the heavy rolls of material and other equipment.\u201cDagu Glacier is our lifeblood. The glacier makes us who we are,\" said Lie Ganze, an indigenous villager.All these efforts were physically demanding, particularly due to the cold conditions at such a high altitude. Several members of the team were struggling with altitude sickness and had to keep their oxygen bottles close in order to keep working for as long as possible.At the peak, researchers bored deep holes into the ice to firmly secure the new material onto the glacier\u2019s slippery surface. Each hole could take up to 30 minutes to complete. Other team members were inserting measurement tools in order to assess the effectiveness of the new material. The researchers also inserted poles into the holes to determine the glacier\u2019s melting rate and used radars to scan the thickness of the ice.\u201cThis project demonstrates interdisciplinary collaboration at its best,\u201d he proudly shared after putting their research into practice outside of the laboratory for the first time. \u201cAll of my previous experiments have been conducted in the laboratory. I have never undertaken such a large-scale experiment in the field outside of the laboratory. It is remarkable that a team of specialists from various disciplines came together and collaborated seamlessly to take this project off the ground.\u201dIt will take three to five years to assess the effectiveness of the new material. If the data is positive and the material can be produced at reasonable cost, it could be pivotal in helping to preserve Dagu and other glaciers in the world. There could also be opportunities for industrial application.\u201cIn material science, we have a saying. Substances should be developed into tools that can be put into good use.\u201dHowever, deep in Professor Zhu\u2019s heart, there is more at stake in this experiment than just science.\u201cWe have received overwhelming support from the local communities over the past years. The protection of the glacier is more important than ever as it underpins the entire ecosystem as well as the livelihood of the locals.\u201d\u201cPreliminary data suggests that the use of the new material is an effective solution but unfortunately it only brings temporary relief. The root cause of glacier melting is global warming and so cutting carbon emissions is the only way to save the glaciers. It is vital for the world community to take aggressive actions to address global warming to save our planet and ensure the survival of humanity.\u201d",

The news comes days after Baidu revealed a slew of AI-powered applications on Tuesday in the wake of more supportive regulation. Tencent has said it was internally testing its Hunyuan AI model on advertising and fintech. The gaming and social media giant is also set to release an AI chatbot on Thursday, the company said in an online post. Tencent is integrating Hunyuan's capabilities with its existing products for video conferencing and social media, Tong told CNBC. The company operates WeChat, a widely used messaging and payments app in China, and video conference platform Tencent Meeting.Baidu and several other Chinese companies received the green light in the last few weeks to release AI-powered chatbots to the public. Similar to ChatGPT, the bots purport to respond to queries in a human-like, conversational fashion \u2014 but primarily in Chinese. Some, such as Baidu's Ernie bot, also convert text to images and video, with the help of plugins. OpenAI's ChatGPT isn't officially available in China. The chatbot releases follow new Chinese regulation on generative AI that took effect Aug. 15. When asked about the rules, Tong pointed out that such artificial intelligence is so new that no one knows what impact it will have on society.watch now\"It's prudent to put in some guardrails in place,\" he said. That will help make sure the technology or the services being offered are of high enough quality so they don't create and distribute false information, he said. Chinese authorities said the \"interim\" rules that took effect last month would not apply to companies developing the AI tech as long as the product was not available to the mass public. That's more relaxed than a draft released in April that said forthcoming rules would apply even at the research stage.Development constraintsWhile Beijing has shown it is more supportive of generative AI than initially feared, Chinese companies also face U.S. restrictions on obtaining advanced semiconductors. The most cutting edge versions of the high-tech chips, known as graphics processing units (GPUs), allow companies to train AI models. \"The constraint that we're facing will hinder the progress, the speed of development,\" Tong told CNBC in response to a question about U.S. restrictions.watch nowHe noted demand for computing power overall far exceeds supply in China. To mitigate the shortage, he said companies are \"focusing on specific use cases, building models of the appropriate size.\" \"And we are hoping that the supply of the GPU compute will be larger in the coming months, and therefore the development of these technologies can get faster.\"AI for business",

The rules are causing consternation in the industry that publishing apps in the world's second largest economy will become very difficult and many apps may need to be taken down.The new rules, which require mobile app publishers to file business details with the government, gave app stores in China until the end of August to establish their filing systems to oversee new apps.\"The Android app stores have confirmed that new apps require the app filings from Friday onwards, and existing apps must have it from March 31 onwards,\" Rich Bishop, CEO of app publishing firm AppInChina said.\"It forces all global apps on these app stores to either establish a local entity or work with a local partner.\"The new rules show that while authorities appear to have ended a years-long, wide-ranging regulatory crackdown on China's technology sector, it still faces scrutiny as Beijing aims to keep business activities pegged to its socialist ideals.Last week, Android-based app stores operated by Tencent, Huawei Technologies (HWT.UL), Xiaomi, OPPO and Vivo issued notices to app publishers and said they will bar new apps without sufficient paperwork from being featured on their platforms. Some of the notices were seen by Reuters while others featured in blog posts by Xiaomi, OPPO and Vivo.Apple (AAPL.O) has not disclosed how its app store in China will comply with Beijing's new rules.

It provides solutions spanning industries such as internet, gaming, finance, tourism and hospitality, automotive, as well as retail.With the launch of Hunyuan and a thriving international business, Tencent is committed to open collaboration in the ecosystem, with domestic businesses ultimately benefitting from the company\u2019s high-quality model services, while international businesses leverage Tencent to access the Chinese market, in addition to undertaking their own digital transformations using Tencent products and services.On a separate matter, Tencent has also debuted its proprietary foundation model, Hunyuan, at its flagship Global Digital Ecosystem Summit in Shenzhen on Thursday. It is now open to enterprises in China for testing and building apps via APIs on Tencent Cloud.Enterprises in China may now access Hunyuan via Tencent\u2019s public cloud platform and finetune it to their specific needs. The platform features strong Chinese language processing abilities, advanced logical reasoning, and comes with reliable task execution abilities.Tencent\u2019s foundation model supports a wide array of functions spanning the creation of images, copywriting, text recognition, and customer service, to name a few. These will be instrumental in key industries like finance, public services, social media, e-commerce, transportation, games, and many more, the company added.This empowers enterprises to build powerful tools, in addition to training their own unique large models derived from Tencent\u2019s Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) offering, which was first introduced in June this year. The MaaS provides enterprises with economically viable, industry-specific large models, featuring more than 50 solutions spanning 20 major industries, Tencent said. This creates a virtuous cycle in which enterprises refine their large models with Hunyuan to create uniquely intelligent services across their operations, it added.Hunyuan has also been connected to 50 of Tencent\u2019s own products, including Tencent Cloud, Tencent Advertising, Tencent Games, Tencent Fintech, Tencent Meeting, Tencent Docs, Weixin Search, QQ Browser, and other core offerings.Hunyuan will be extended to even more businesses and applications over time, according to Tencent.",

            "description": "The logo of China's Tencent Music Entertainment Group is seen next to the apps of its music services QQ Music, Kuwo and Kugou, in this illustration picture taken March 22, 2021. REUTERS/Florence Lo/Illustration/File Photo Acquire Licensing RightsHONG KONG, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Chinese online content platforms including Tencent Music (1698.HK) and NetEase's Cloud Music (9899.HK) have removed live streaming features that analysts say could be used for illegal gambling, at a hefty cost to their quarterly revenues.Analysts say online content platforms pulled the plug on features such as virtual lucky draws after the government in June started cracking down on live streaming, as part of a wider clampdown on online gambling.While the platforms say they ban gambling, analysts say the extremely popular lucky draws are often manipulated by live streamers colluding with viewers to share the prize.These features have increased the popularity of live streaming, a market which was worth around 152 billion yuan ($21 billion) in 2022, research firm Analysys said.The crackdown spurred Tencent Music and Huya (HUYA.N) to \"pre-emptively disable live streaming features that contain games of chance\", said Ivan Su, an analyst at Morningstar, cutting off a lucractive source of revenue.In their second-quarter earnings posted last week, Tencent's online music arm Tencent Music and its Twitch-like game broadcasting platform Huya said their social entertainment revenues, which include live streaming, declined by 24% and 16% compared to the same year-ago period.On Thursday, Cloud Music, a music streaming service majority owned by NetEase, reported social entertainment revenue, which accounts for about half of total revenue, also fell 24% in the second quarter year-on-year.None of these companies mentioned the gambling crackdown when they reported their earnings, and they did not respond to request for further comment.However, the co-founder of a popular live streaming platform in Guangzhou, who declined to be named citing the sensitivity of the topic, told Reuters that several popular live streaming and live chat apps had to suspend services after police probes.Local media has also reported that between May and July, about 40 live chat apps were shut down for \"business adjustment\".\"We expect the anti-gambling crackdown... to eliminate 20% to 70% of live streaming revenue, depending on each platform's exposure,\" Charlie Chai, an analyst at 86Research, said.\"It should take two quarters for the impact to be fully absorbed a third in Q2, and the remaining two-thirds in Q3.\"In their earnings report, Tencent said it was adjusting its live streaming business to become more \"music-centric\" while Huya said it was working to make the platform atmosphere \"healthier\". Cloud Music said it was reinforcing its \"internal controls mechanism... and adopting stricter monitoring over irregular user activities\".While Chinese authorities say they have ended a years-long, wide-ranging regulatory crackdown on its technology sector, scrutiny has continued as Beijing looks to rectify social and business activities in line with socialist norms.Online gambling remains a concern, with the authorities saying in 2020 that the cross-border flow of funds for gambling posed a national security risk.Analyst Chai said several platforms took down lottery-like features in 2020 in response to regulatory pressure but introduced new ones later with minor modifications.($1 = 7.2872 Chinese yuan renminbi)Reporting by Josh Ye and Farah Master; Editing by Brenda Goh and Miral FahmyOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "description": "Tencent's (OTC:TCEHY) most recent results showcased renewed growth for the Chinese tech conglomerate. After a period of share price underperformance caused by doubts about its prospects, the recent revival has put the stock's low valuation in the spotlight. Despite ongoing concerns tied to Tencent's investment case, including the overall uncertainties surrounding Chinese equities, it seems that the stock now offers an attractive balance of risk and reward. Accordingly, I am bullish on the stock.Growth Re-Accelerating Across the BoardTencent's growth seems to be re-accelerating across the board after the company went through a few tough quarters last year. Specifically, here's Tencent's revenue growth in the five quarters prior to Q2-2023.Q1-2022 revenue growth: 0.12%Q2-2022 revenue growth: -3.1%Q3-2022 revenue growth: -1.6%Q4-2022 revenue growth: 0.5%Q1-2023 revenue growth: 10.7%The relatively underwhelming growth metrics during Fiscal 2022 compared to the double-digit top-line growth Tencent investors were used to can be attributed to several factors. These include the Chinese government's crackdown on big tech, the limitations imposed on the amount of time minors can play video games, and the ongoing tough macroeconomic landscape, which negatively impacted Tencent's advertising businesses, among other challenges.However, with Tencent's businesses successfully absorbing these headwinds last year and the company continuing to invest in growth, Tencent's performance in Fiscal 2023 has been nothing short of impressive. After posting robust revenue growth of 10.7% in Q1, Tencent's most recent Q2 results showcased another quarter of excellent results, with revenues growing by 11.3% to $20.6 billion. Results were driven by a strong rebound in the traction of the majority of Tencent's businesses.Value-Added ServicesTencent's Value-Added Services segment, which represents around half the company's revenues, posted revenue growth of 4% to about $10.2 billion. This segment includes Tencent's Social Networks sub-segment (20% of revenues), its Domestic Games sub-segment (21% of revenues), and its International Games sub-segment (9% of revenues), all of which performed well.Tencent's Social Media segment saw year-over-year revenue growth of 2% to roughly $4.1 billion, driven by increased revenue from mini-games and music subscriptions, while WeChat's Monthly Active Users (MAU) reached a staggering 1.327 billion, up 2% compared to last year.Further, while Domestic Games revenues remained steady year-over-year due to Tencent releasing not-as-commercial content in its most popular games after a strong first quarter, International Games revenues grew by 19% to around $1.7 billion, benefiting from the robust performance of VALORANT, NIKKE, and Triple Match 3D, as well as currency tailwinds.AdvertisingTencent's Online Advertising segment, which makes up 17% of revenues, also posted a strong rebound, with revenues growing by 34% to around $3.4 billion. While such a strong growth rate certainly benefited from comparison against the pandemic-affected, depressed period a year ago, management believes that Tencent outpaced the overall industry.Management attributed Tencent's outperformance to enhancements to the machine learning systems powering its ad platform and robust demand for Video Accounts ads. Further, advertising spending with ads grew at a double-digit rate year-on-year in every principal advertiser category other than transportation.FinTech and Business ServicesLastly, FinTech and Business Services, which comprise 32% of Tencent's total revenues, posted revenue growth of 15% to around $6.7 billion. Specifically, in FinTech Services, daily active users and transactions per user in commercial payments posted growth year-on-year. Online and offline payment volumes also grew in the double digits, as consumption spending generally picked up. Finally, Tencent's wealth management business experienced healthy growth driven by assets under management (AUM) growth.Strong Profitability Prospects Expose the Stock's UndervaluationTencent is now seeing enhanced profitability prospects, primarily due to its strong revenue growth and the company's massive scope unlocking economies of scale. In particular, the company's gross, operating, and net margins in Q2 expanded from 43%, 22%, and 14% last year to 47%, 27%, and 18%, respectively. Accordingly, Tencent's adjusted EPS landed at RMB3.875 ($0.53), up from RMB2.896 ($0.40 last year).Based on the company's half-year results and its ongoing momentum, analysts' consensus EPS estimate for Fiscal 2023 currently stands at $2.12. This implies that Tencent stock is currently trading at a P/E of about 19.2x. Looking 12 months out, Tencent's forward P/E stands at 16.2x, which is the lowest multiple the stock has traded at since 2005. Given the stock's double-digit growth, massive moat, and unmatched economies of scale, this multiple offers both a great margin of safety and upside potential, in my view.While one could argue that Tencent being a Chinese company comes attached with additional risks, which in turn, justifies shares trading at a discount, the company has a prolonged track of excellent execution and shareholder value creation. Hence, I believe the stock should be valued in line with its American peers.Is TCEHY Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?Turning to Wall Street, Tencent Holdings has garnered just a single analyst rating in the past three months. It's a Buy rating, with TCEHY stock's price target coming in at $50, implying 19.8% upside potential.Final ThoughtsTencent's resurgence in revenues in Q2 marks a turning point for the tech titan. Its results underscore its resilience and adaptability to overcome challenges from regulatory shifts and economic headwinds. With robust growth across its diverse segments, Tencent's strategic investments and scalable operations shine through.Further, bolstered margins and the stock's seemingly attractive valuation further accentuate its investment prospects. In an environment where uncertainties persist in Chinese equities, Tencent emerges as a compelling beacon of balanced risk and alluring reward.DisclosureThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

Daniel Zhang concluded his tenure as CEO of Alibaba with a noteworthy report; concurrently, Pony Ma of Tencent and Richard Liu of JD.com also concluded their lengthy transitional periods with strong financial performance.On September 10th, Zhang will relinquish his position at Alibaba. Alibaba's \"1+6+N\" strategy was implemented in March. As details emerge, however, the new overall structure appears more like \"1+5+n-1\" \u2013 Alibaba Cloud will be completely spun off, with Alibaba holding no shares, rendering a \"-\" more accurate than the \"+\" in the initial plan.Zhang's final report as CEO highlights commendable sector-wide performance. Important industries, namely \"International Business,\" \"Local Life,\" \"Cainiao,\" and \"Entertainment,\" all experienced revenue growth in excess of 29%.In addition, \"TaoTian\" (a restructured entity comprised of Taobao and Tmall), which is projected to account for half of Alibaba's revenue, rebounded with double-digit growth, a 40% gross margin, and a 6.5% increase in Taobao's DAU after seven consecutive quarters of decline or single-digit growth.In contrast, Alibaba Cloud's growth was disappointing at 4.1%. Nonetheless, this will also function as a relatively low baseline for the next quarter. With AI-driven revenue growth in its infancy, the company is on the verge of achieving substantial growth.These impressive results validate Alibaba's strategic reorientation since March. With Zhang poised to assume full control of Alibaba Cloud, this report serves as a foundational resource for the company's future direction.JD.comThe most recent report from JD.com highlighted its substantial subsidy strategy, with mixed results.Nevertheless, this quarter marks JD.com's first foray into a new strategic domain. After extensive internal reorganisation, the question was whether the team could exemplify the founder's vision without causing major disruptions.The recent introduction of subsidies left JD.com in uncharted territory. Their decision to cultivate third-party merchants necessitates a reallocation of resources from its own domain. The ensuing information from this quarter, particularly the crucial profit margin from the 3C category, will be crucial.The second quarter metrics for JD.com are instructive: a 417% YoY increase in new merchants and a 11.4% YoY increase in 3C product revenue. Although the operating profit margin was below historical norms at 2.9%, both year-over-year and sequential growth occurred during the quarter.During the earnings call, JD.com's CFO highlighted the company's robust performance in core sectors and double-digit growth across metrics.Richard Liu's transitional period has come to a close as these indicators point to a sustained and intensified price-centric focus.TencentIn contrast, Tencent's reports are typically mundane and frequently downplay WeChat's contributions. This quarter, however, deviated from this norm.Tencent's report revealed the 3 billion in advertising revenue for Wechat's \"Channel\" function. This figure was highlighted 25 times during the earnings call, highlighting the increased user engagement and the beginning of a robust profit stream. Live commerce also saw a 150% increase in transactions year over year.Such insights into the commercial potential of WeChat have long been desired.Historically, WeChat's commercial essence remained concealed, either incorporated within larger revenue narratives or alluded to in earnings calls. This report's unique emphasis on WeChat alludes at a paradigm shift, emphasising WeChat's growing importance in Tencent's commercial and expansion efforts.In conclusion, these financial results are less about the numbers and more about indicating strategic shifts, addressing obstacles, and outlining the future course of action. In an increasingly digital and interconnected world, their future will be determined by the course they chart in response to these revelations.Feature image: Animals Vectors by Vecteezy (modified)",

            "description": "Tencent (TCEHY -0.22%) posted its second-quarter report on Aug. 16. The Chinese tech giant's revenue rose 11% year over year to 149.2 billion yuan ($20.6 billion) but missed analysts' estimates by 2.5 billion yuan. Its net profit grew 41% to 26.2 billion yuan ($3.6 billion), but also missed the consensus forecast by 7.3 billion yuan. Tencent's stock dipped slightly after the report, but it remains up 3% for the year.Let's review the key numbers and see if the bulls or bears are likely to gain the upper hand in the period ahead.The key numbersDuring the second quarter, Tencent generated 50% of its revenue from its value-added services (VAS) business, which collects fees from its video games, social media apps, and streaming media platforms. Nearly 33% of its revenue came from its fintech and business services division, which houses its WeChat Pay digital payments platform, Tencent Cloud platform, and other enterprise-oriented services. The remaining 17% came from its online advertising business, which sells ads across all of its websites, apps, and streaming services. Here's how its three core businesses fared over the past year.Revenue Growth (YOY) Q2 2022 Q3 2022 Q4 2022 Q1 2023 Q2 2023 Value-Added Services0% (3%) (2%) 9% 4% Fintech and Business Services1% 4% (1%) 14% 15% Online Advertising(18%) (5%) 15% 17% 34% Total(3%) (2%) 0.5% 11% 11%What the bulls will tell youThe bulls will note that the company's fintech and business services unit and its online advertising unit are generating accelerating growth again. Last year, the macro headwinds and China's COVID lockdowns curbed the growth of its fintech and business services unit by curbing consumer spending on WeChat Pay and forcing companies to rein in their software spending. Those challenges also prompted businesses to buy fewer ads on WeChat, the super app that served 1.33 billion monthly active users at the end of the second quarter, as well as its other platforms.But those pressures eased after China ended its draconian \"zero COVID\" policies this January. Its fintech business expanded as its daily active users and transactions per user for its commercial payments rose year over year. Its wealth management business also experienced \"healthy growth\" in users and total assets under management, while its business services unit returned to a \"low-double-digit\" growth rate again as it collected more fees for hosting e-commerce streaming videos on its cloud platform. The booming demand for video-based ads also boosted its advertising revenue again.Tencent's total adjusted operating margin also expanded seven percentage points year over year to 34% as it cut costs and streamlined its sprawling business. As a result, its free cash flow (FCF) rose 34% to 29.9 billion yuan ($4.1 billion).For the full year, analysts expect Tencent's revenue and earnings to grow 9% and 28%, respectively. Based on those forecasts, Tencent's stock still looks cheap at 19 times forward earnings.What the bears will tell youThe bears will point out that Tencent's VAS revenue growth decelerated again in the second quarter after briefly bouncing back in the first quarter. Its domestic gaming revenue stayed nearly flat year over year as it released less content for its top games. That sluggish growth offset its 19% growth in international gaming revenue, which was primarily driven by new games like Valorant, Triple Match 3D, and Goddess of Victory: Nikke.The Chinese government finally greenlit some of Tencent's games earlier this year after suspending its approvals of all new video game licenses throughout 2021 and 2022. However, Tencent still faces tight playtime restrictions for minors and intense competition across China's crowded gaming market. Tencent is trying to offset that domestic pressure by expanding beyond China and acquiring more overseas studios, but that expansion could also be disrupted by regulatory and antitrust headwinds.The bears also expect Tencent to keep struggling in the fintech, cloud, and advertising markets as the Chinese economy stabilizes. Its WeChat Pay still faces lots of competition from Alipay, which is owned by Alibaba's fintech affiliate Ant Group. Tencent Cloud also only controlled 17% of China's cloud infrastructure market in the first quarter of 2023, according to Canalys, putting it in third place behind Huawei Cloud (20%) and Alibaba Cloud (34%). As for the advertising business, it still needs to pull advertisers away from formidable competitors like ByteDance's Douyin (known as TikTok overseas) and Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall marketplaces.Even if Tencent overcomes those challenges, overseas investors could continue to shun its shares as long as U.S. regulators threaten to de-list all U.S.-listed Chinese stocks (including OTC ones like Tencent).Which thesis makes more sense?Tencent is still growing, but the bulls would do well to stay away until its gaming business stabilizes and the regulatory issues in the U.S. and China are fully resolved. For now, investors should stick with other tech stocks instead of betting on Tencent's recovery.",

            "description": "Asia In Brief Tencent's chief strategy officer James Mitchell has told investors the Chinese web giant's hyperscale cloud operation is bullish on its AI-models-as-a-service (MaaS) business because customers will find migration away from it hard.Speaking on the company's Q2 2023 earnings call, Mitchell was asked about the potential of the MaaS business and replied that he sees large enterprises as the early adopters, followed by small and medium businesses.Those smaller buyers, he said, will want MaaS because they will want AI but probably won't want to train their own models.He predicted that would mean \"high margin and high recurring revenue is going to be true.\"\"Once the customers start using these services, right, it will be built into their interaction with their customers, which will be much more sticky than if it's in their back-end systems,\" he observed.Tencent's Q2 revenue came in at $20.6 billion, up 11 percent year on year. The conglomerate does not break out separate revenue from its cloud services, but reported \"modest growth.\"Average monthly users of Tencent's WeChat and QQ social networks continued to grow, to 1.327 billion and 571 million respectively.LucasFilm shutters Singapore studioLucasFilm last week announced the closure of the Singapore outpost of its visual effects and animation studio, Industrial Light and Magic (ILM).Parent company Disney reportedly cited \"economic factors\" as the reason for the closure.Singapore's Economic Development Board (EDB) told The Register the decision was \"in response to changes in the industry and business conditions\" and that the global media industry is \"facing disruption from rapid technological advancements, while studios are coping with challenges relating to talent and profitability.\"ILM's Singapore digs were housed in a building known as the \"Sandcrawler\", as its design wa inspired by its Star Wars-affiliated namesake. The building was sold to the Blackstone Group in January 2021. \u2013 Laura DobbersteinChinese media lashes India's tech policiesA strongly worded article has appeared in mutiple Chinese state-owned media, accusing India of using its tax laws to make life hard for Chinese mobile phone brands. The article suggests actions such as the 2022 probe of Xiaomi's tax affairs may have been conducted as part of Indian efforts to grow its tech industries and take advantage of many organizations' desire to diversify their manufacturing operations in ways that reduce reliance on China.The article labels India's activities as \"more ruthless\" than the US's actions against China, possibly \"malicious,\" and also the sign of a certain immaturity.The article concludes with quotes from Lin Minwang, deputy director of the Center for South Asian Studies at Fudan University, who suggested Chinese companies may not need India anyway, with Bangladesh and other south Asian markets offering a comparable growth opportunity.Alipay targets inbound touristsAlipay, the Alibaba-owned digital payment platform, last week updated the international edition of its service targeting tourists visiting China.The update means users of the Alipay app outside China can attach local Visa, Mastercard, JCB, Discover, and Diners Club cards to their accounts, and use them to pay inside China.Airline and hotel bookings are also possible with the enhanced service, which is offered in English alongside a translation service for speakers of other languages.Red Apple celebrates 30 years in ChinaApple last week celebrated the thirtieth anniversary of its presence in China.A Chinese language press release summarized Apple's contribution to the local economy and society, environmental initiatives, and the role its products have played in Chinese lives.\"For 30 years, we've taken pride in serving local people \u2013 sharing the latest innovations with our customers and giving back to the communities where we live,\" said Apple CEO Tim Cook. \"We'll continue to do our part. To enrich the lives of Chinese customers, help them connect and unleash their full creative potential, and do our best to make the world a better place.\"Australia may not be master of its own domain.au Domain Administration Limited (auDA), the administrator of Australia's .au domain space, has warned stakeholders that cyber criminals appear to have accessed its internal data.In a Sunday update, the org said it was alerted to the incident on August 18, and that an entity claiming to be the attacker has since provided evidence of a small sample of data they say is in their possession.That sample includes screenshots of a file list from a computer.\"Our investigation remains ongoing, including to verify the cyber criminal's claims and the provenance of this data,\" the update states. The org has not characterized the information that may have been accessed.\"In the interim, we encourage everyone to remain vigilant to potential malicious online activity such as phishing attempts and scams from persons or organizations requesting, or using, your personal details,\" the auDA notice states, before advising that the org will not ask for passwords or other sensitive information.UPDATED at 3:45PM on August 21: auDA has issued an update in which it states its \"comprehensive investigation indicates that there is no evidence that cyber criminals have accessed auDA systems or have auDA data.\"The update explains that the screenshot mentioned above did not depict auDA files, and that the screenshot instead appears to have been sourced from a ransomware victim who holds and Australian domain name.In other news \u2026Our Asia-Pacific coverage last week included word that Vietnam is running dangerously low on infosec professionals, and needs more in a hurry.The good news for Vietnam is that it's on the list of territories into which mega-manufacturer Foxconn is planning to expand, as it pours billions into India.Speaking of India, it has scored some big wins with its India Stack set of digital government services being deployed in nearly a dozen countries.China's game of tit-for-tat against the United States continues, with dark hints that the US has been hacking into Chinese seismic detectors with nefarious intent.Beijing's steep regulatory requirements and perhaps deliberately leisurely pace granting takeover approvals managed to put the kibosh on a multi-billion-dollar deal between Intel and Israeli foundry Tower Semiconductor.

Download ETBrandEquity App Get Realtime updatesSave your favourite articles Scan to download AppRevenue growth for Chinese social media and gaming giant Tencent Holdings was smaller than expected in the second quarter, as a sputtering economy weighed on its recovery from last year's record downturn. Tencent 's core gaming business experienced weaker-than-expected growth in the quarter through June. Domestic gaming revenue was little changed at 31.8 billion yuan, while international gaming revenue rose 12% to 12.7 billion yuan, excluding the impact of currency movements.In a call with analysts, James Mitchell, the company's chief strategy officer, attributed slow growth in video games to a decision \"to temporarily release less commercially impactful content\" in the second quarter.However, industry analysts said world's largest video game company and operator of the WeChat messaging platform now faces heavy competition from rivals in the industry.Shawn Yang, an analyst at Blue Lotus Capital Advisors, said while Tencent's old hit games have delivered sub-par revenues due to lack of content, its new games face fierce competition from rival game companies such as NetEase Inc and miHoYo.Revenue grew 11% to 149.20 billion yuan ($20.45 billion) in the three months ended June 30, below the 151.73 billion yuan average estimate of 21 analysts compiled by Refinitiv Revenue growth was little changed from a 10.7% rise in the first quarter. Tencent posted a 1% revenue drop in the same period last year on its first-ever sales decline amid Beijing's regulatory crackdown on the tech sector.Regulatory concern has eased this year for China's tech giants, including Tencent, with Chinese authorities keen to boost private sector confidence. But the world's second-largest economy has failed to surge after it lifted COVID-19 restrictions late last year.Net profit rose 41% to 26.17 billion yuan as compared to the same period last year. But it fell under the 33.41 billion yuan average analyst estimate.Revenue from online ads stood out as one of the bright spots. It grew 34% to 25 billion yuan as its TikTok-like short video service Video Accounts experienced increased demand.Revenue from fintech and business services grew 15% to 48.6 billion yuan which the company said reflected expansion in both offline and online payment activities.On Beijng's regulatory stance, Tencent said the government had become supportive of platform companies like Tencent.Asked about the potential impact of Beijing's newly proposed rules to ban children from using smartphones for more than two hours a day, Martin Lau, Tencent's president, said on the call he expects \"no material impact\" to Tencent, which has already banned minors from using its services for a long period of time.Lau again highlighted AI as a key focus for Tencent, adding that Tencent is preparing its self-developed foundation model for a launch later this year.",

            "description": "Lintao ZhangTencent Holdings Limited (OTCPK:TCEHY) is a Chinese tech titan that has seen its stock go nowhere over the past 5 years. The stock is often overlooked by American investors in favor of Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA), but TCEHY offers Facebook-like positioning while also having the same conglomerate set of businesses.Over the last several quarters, TCEHY has improved its balance sheet to a net cash position, and its cost savings initiatives are starting to bear fruit, with the company generating multi-year highs in free cash flow. The company curiously accelerated its share repurchase program near the end of the second quarter, a detail that I suspect many investors may have overlooked, as TCEHY and other Chinese stocks have seemingly traded solely based on perception of U.S.-Chinese political tensions. TCEHY stock trades at too deep of a discount to comparable U.S. operators - patient investors might be rewarded for their bravery here.TCEHY Stock PriceI last covered TCEHY in November 2022, where I rated the stock a buy as it was trading cheaply even before accounting for its equity portfolio. The stock has rallied strongly since then, benefitting from a strong recovery in growth stocks overall.Data by YChartsBut over the last 5 years, the stock has gone nowhere, as its solid growth during that time span has been offset by multiple compression. While TCEHY might not look like it\u2019s trading at the same price as it did 5 years ago, the growth since then means that it\u2019s significantly cheaper - this is a secular growth stock trading at value multiples.Tencent Stock Key MetricsIn this past quarter, TCEHY saw a solid recovery in growth, with overall revenues growing 11% YOY. While TCEHY is largely known for its dominant video game portfolio, we can see below that video games made up around 30% of overall revenues with the remainder coming from social networks, online advertising, fintech, and cloud computing.2023 Q2 PresentationDue to the company\u2019s large size, TCEHY has seen stagnant growth in its gaming and social network businesses, though it did see a 19% YOY gain in international gaming revenues on the backs of some new game releases.2023 Q2 PresentationTCEHY remains optimistic for the long-term growth of its social network business, noting that they have been able to drive notable growth in user engagement, which may help long term monetization efforts.2023 Q2 PresentationTCEHY saw the greatest financial recovery in online advertising, with revenues growing 34% YOY in this segment. This was in part due to easier post-pandemic comparables as well as momentum in their user engagement.2023 Q2 PresentationTCEHY also saw 15% YOY growth in its fintech and cloud businesses. TCEHY saw solid growth from its payment processing due to the Chinese economic recovery, and its cloud businesses finally returned to double-digit growth.2023 Q2 PresentationThe strong recovery in revenue growth came as the company began to reap the fruits from its cost-cutting initiatives, as profits grew by 33% YOY.2023 Q2 PresentationIf we exclude equity-based compensation, then net profits grew even faster at 40% YOY. Together with rationalizing in CapEx, TCEHY has been able to drive a strong upswing in free cash flow generation. After seeing free cash flow (\"FCF\") decline two years sequentially heading into the year, TCEHY has generated $132.4 billion RMB in free cash flow over the trailing twelve months, which would be the highest over any full-year period.2023 Q2 PresentationTCEHY has also managed to swing from a net debt to a net cash position, and that is before counting their $108 billion USD investment portfolio (the market cap recently stood at around $400 billion).2023 Q2 PresentationWhat I am most excited about is to see TCEHY seem to increase the aggressiveness of its share repurchase program, purchasing 36 million shares for $11 billion RMB (for reference, the company purchased $28 billion RMB in all of 2022). We can see below that the vast majority of those shares were purchased in the month of June alone.2023 Q2 ReleaseI was disappointed to see a lack of discussion on the share repurchase program on the conference call, though there also weren\u2019t any questions about it, to be fair. There, management reiterated expectations for recent Chinese regulations targeting under 18 video game usage to have \u201cminimal\u201d impact on their financial results (due to that not being their target audience), but also expressing confidence that the regulatory environment was trending towards normalization. I suspect that such commentary has done little to ease concerns about potential regulatory risk for the company, as that seems to be the main driver of the stock\u2019s persistent undervaluation.Is TCEHY Stock A Buy, Sell, or Hold?TCEHY is a true tech titan in China, having market leadership in industries ranging from social networks to enterprise tech and peer to peer payments.2023 Q2 Business UpdateThe crown jewel of TCEHY is arguably their WeChat app (known as Weixin in China), which has often been called the \u201cFacebook of China.\u201d It might be better known as being similar to Facebook Messenger, though Chinese citizens tend to use WeChat similar as they would Facebook. TCEHY touts over 1.3 billion monthly active users (\"MAUs\") in WeChat alone.2023 Q2 Business UpdateTCEHY is also often overlooked for its enterprise tech product offerings, but it should be considered one of the enterprise tech titans in China, similar to Alphabet\u2019s (GOOGL) positioning with Google Cloud Platform.2023 Q2 Business UpdateIn spite of owning many profitable businesses with strong secular growth stories, TCEHY stock recently traded hands at just under 18x this year\u2019s earnings estimates.Seeking AlphaThat comes in spite of consensus estimates calling for double-digit top line growth over the coming years.Seeking AlphaSure, TCEHY isn\u2019t as cheap as BABA, but its businesses are arguably more deserving of premium valuations, as BABA may be facing some price competition in its e-commerce operations. I note that TCEHY\u2019s equity investment portfolio made up just around 25% of its current market cap, and management has expressed some willingness in prior conference calls to monetize their portfolio in order to highlight the undervaluation of the stock price. In contrast, names like Meta Platforms (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are trading at 22x and 29x earnings, respectively. Assuming a re-valuation to a 20x earnings multiple, TCEHY might trade at around $57 per share by 2024, suggesting around 35% potential upside over the next 12 months. With management being as aggressive as ever in their share repurchase program, I view it as being a matter of time before Wall Street wakes up to the recovery in this growth story.What are the key risks? The risks are high and numerous here. TCEHY may be facing threats from Chinese brand TikTok, and it is not clear if WeChat is losing market share to TikTok in a secular fashion. Like META in the U.S., TCEHY has rolled out short-form video in WeChat in order to fend off the competition, but it remains to be seen if these efforts are sufficient.We mustn\u2019t ignore the elephant in the room: rising geopolitical tensions are not the friend of investors. The Biden Administration has recently issued a ban on certain U.S. tech investments in China, and it is possible that at some point the U.S. may ban investing in Chinese securities altogether. Trading of Russian stocks remains restricted for U.S. citizens, providing some precedent to what might happen for Chinese stocks if geopolitical tensions were to escalate, perhaps if China decides to invade Taiwan. Even if such a ban never takes place, the possibility and fear of such a ban is likely to lead to a valuation overhang that may persist indefinitely.I think that the valuation overhang is too pronounced here (especially after considering the investment portfolio), but it is possible that it widens further. An even more aggressive share repurchase program would arguably be enough to address such issues, but it isn\u2019t clear if TCEHY would be allowed by the Chinese government to approve such a program.While being mindful of the high risk profile of this stock, I reiterate my buy rating, as even after the rally from the lows, Tencent Holdings Limited is still trading at value-like multiples in spite of an improving growth and profitability profile.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

            "description": "Security researchers at Citizen Lab discovered a number of cryptographic vulnerabilities in the Sogou Input Method keyboard software made by Tencent, the most popular input method in China. These vulnerabilities allow adversaries with a privileged network position (such as an ISP or anyone with access to upstream routers) to read the text a user inputs on a device in real-time as it's being typed. Users of the Sogou Keyboard are highly encouraged to upgrade to patched versions that fix this vulnerability:Windows >= version 13.7Android >= version 11.26iOS >= version 11.25The report shows the Windows and Android implementations were vulnerable to eavesdropping, while the iOS version wasn\u2019t. Of particular note, Sogou Input Method has around 450 million monthly active users worldwide. It's used not only in China, but also has a large userbase in the United States, Japan, and Taiwan. It is not known if this vulnerability was previously discovered or exploited. However, given the level of network access and broad latitude afforded to state authorities within China, it\u2019s possible that users of the keyboard (especially those located within China) may have had their private communications leaked to the Chinese state.Home-rolled Cryptography Strikes AgainThe researchers found this vulnerability was due to the use of custom cryptography vulnerable to a padding oracle attack. Implementing cryptographic algorithms is an extremely precarious and rigorous effort. Even when done relatively well, a side-channel attack can undo the basic guarantees these algorithms are meant to provide. Best practice dictates that well-vetted cryptographic libraries which are made available by the system\u2014rather than coded on one\u2019s own\u2014should be used to avoid these attacks and ensure the latest protections are available against weaknesses. As of 2003, the vulnerabilities in this particular implementation were already fixed in TLS implementations.We applaud the scrupulous cryptanalysis and reverse-engineering work done by the security researchers Jeffrey Knockel, Zo\u00eb Reichert, and Mona Wang (who formerly worked at EFF).

That is a 41% year-on-year rise.Tencent is now starting to see the benefits of the cost-cutting drive it embarked on last year, when it exited non-core businesses and tightened marketing spending. The company, which owns China's biggest messaging app WeChat, is now observing a pick-up in its businesses, from gaming to cloud computing.\"During the second quarter of 2023, we sustained a solid revenue growth rate, along with a gravitation toward high quality revenue streams with better margins,\" Tencent said in a statement.\"This transition, combined with careful cost discipline developed in the previous year, resulted in profit growth exceeding revenue growth.\"Tencent has now reported three straight quarters of revenue growth, as the Chinese technology giant recovers from the headwinds of a tough 2022.Firstly, its core gaming business slowed dramatically relative to comparisons with 2021, when people relied more on indoors entertainment because of the spread of the pandemic. Tencent is one of the world's biggest online gaming companies.Secondly, Chinese authorities froze the approval of new games for several months and only restarted the process in April 2022. It took a few months for the regulators after this to approve games published by Tencent.But the weaker-than-expected revenue growth continues to reflect the turbulence of the Chinese economy, which has failed to recover as briskly as many had anticipated after the pandemic.",

REUTERS/Florence Lo/Illustration/File Photo Acquire Licensing RightsAug 15 (Reuters) - China's Tencent Music Entertainment Group (1698.HK), reported a 5.5% increase in quarterly revenue thanks to a rise in user subscriptions but warned that future revenue will shrink because of tighter live-streaming controls.The Spotify-like music streaming company controlled by Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) is making adjustments to its live-streaming business in order to \"better control potential risks the platform may face in the future,\" Tony Yip, its chief strategy officer, told analysts on a call.He did not elaborate on the type of risks and said the company is adjusting live streaming functions and adopting more stringent compliant procedures, describing them as necessary for its platform's \"healthy development in the long run\".The move comes after China launched an anti-gambling crackdown in June that has forced many internet platforms to disable lucrative features such as virtual item trades.Industry experts said many livestreaming platforms offer lottery-like features in which a small amount of money grants a chance of winning high-value virtual items.Although such features do not strictly qualify as gambling, numerous third-party platforms have since emerged to let users trade virtual items, a phenomenon that led to the recent crackdown, Charlie Chai, an analyst at 86Research, said.Tencent Music said its total revenues will experience \"a low to mid-teens percent decrease\" in the coming quarter compared with the same period last year as a result of its risk-control measures.But it said profit will continue to grow this year.Tencent Music's shares gained about 1.68% in Hong Kong on Wednesday.Total revenue rose to 7.29 billion yuan ($1.00 billion) in the quarter to June 30, in line with Wall Street estimates, as the number of paying users of its online music streaming service rose more than 20% to 100 million, a milestone for the company.Net profit attributable to equity holders rose to 1.30 billion yuan from 856 million yuan a year earlier.($1 = 7.2850 Chinese yuan)Reporting by Josh Ye in Hong Kong and Samrhitha Arunasalam in Bengaluru; Editing by Jan Harvey, Miyoung Kim and Gerry DoyleOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

That increase helped quarterly revenues from music subscriptions to rise by 37% year-on-year to RMB2.89 billion ($399 million).The group, which also incorporates more lucrative but slower growing social music activity such as karaoke, saw total revenue in the quarter rise by 6% to RMB7.29 billion ($1.01 billion). Net profit attributable to equity holders weighed in at RMB1.30 billion ($179 million), a 52% year-over-year increase.Revenues from social entertainment services actually decreased by 25% to RMB3.04 billion ($419 million) from RMB4.03 billion in the same period of 2022. \u201cThe decrease was mainly due to the implementation of service enhancement and risk control measures intended to offer a better music-centric user experience,\u201d the company said, while also suggesting that these measures will help in the future.\u201cWe have seen users become increasingly accustomed and willing to pay for copyrighted music, whether for songs they want to listen to or for premium listening features they enjoy. This trend is evidenced by the all-time high paying ratio and [average revenue per uses] recorded by our online music services in the quarter,\u201d said Cussion Pang, executive chairman of TME. \u201cSuch achievements led to revenues from online music services exceeding that of social entertainment services for the first time in our company\u2019s history.

            "description": "For many of us, daily activities such as going to work, meeting friends, or banking and shopping online are familiar routines in life.An estimated 2.2 billion people worldwide, however, live with a visual impairment, many at moderate or severe levels. For them, performing tasks that others take for granted presents unique challenges. These barriers take away not just convenience, but often, their independence too.In their realm, the sense of touch and hearing are vital, allowing them to interact with and decipher the outside world. An alarm that marks the beginning of a day, the sound of an incoming train, the braille on a touchpad indicating street direction \u2013 these audio and tactile cues serve as guides.Instead of making life easier for people with visual impairments, technology and a digitally connected world can, however, make things harder. Noisy environments can make it hard to get around using voice prompts. And relying on screen-reading software and sound for information can lead to misinterpreting important details and increase online risks.Harnessing the Power of Touch: Haptic TechnologyTo that end, we have been working to optimize touch-based solutions to empower those with sight limitations to \u201csee\u201d the world. We want to create an intuitive sensory language that helps blind and low-vision people better perceive and navigate their surroundings.Such is the basis of our haptic technology. Originally developed for use in the game of Peacekeeper Elite- think of your controller's vibration - haptics involves over 200 different and unique pulses to convey information.Tencent Games\u2019 MTGPA team quickly realized the potential application of this technology beyond gaming to have a wider positive social impact. It brought together key stakeholders including Tencent teams across different divisions, academia, research organizations, and community representatives to collaborate on and advance haptics across various use cases to improve the lives of people with visual impairments.The project team created the industry\u2019s first standardized game vibration tactile feedback system and a tactile feedback international standard, a unified solution that is compatible with both Android and iOS platforms. By 2022, MTGPA Haptics had been installed in more than 240 million smartphones.Understanding User Needs and BenefitsNavigating the Physical World with ConfidenceNavigating the physical world safely is a paramount concern for the visually impaired. Traditional aids such as canes or guide dogs can be influenced by external elements, leading to missteps or disorientation. Catching the correct bus or weaving through crowded, noisy environments can become formidable tasks.Tencent Maps with haptics feedback addresses this challenge. By using smartphone vibrations in conjunction with voice prompts, the technology allows users to navigate physical spaces. No vibration indicates the right direction, with vibrations increasing or decreasing according to degree of deviation from the course.Similarly, custom vibrations combined with voice alerts help users identify approaching buses or trains, and notify them upon reaching their destination. This innovation offers visually impaired users a greater sense of control and confidence in navigating their environment.Secure Digital AccessThe digital world poses unique challenges, with data input and privacy being concerns for the visually impaired. Screen-reading software, typically used for interacting with digital platforms, can inadvertently expose sensitive information in public spaces.Tencent's Sogou Input Method addresses this through specialized haptics feedback. Different vibrations correspond to specific alphanumeric characters on digital keyboards, making it easier for visually impaired users to input information accurately and efficiently. This approach also ensures privacy protection and eliminates the need for screen-reading software.Improving Access to Digital Information Across FormatsVisual data, such as line graphs, often pose difficulties for visually impaired individuals in accessing information. Haptic technology overcomes this limitation by enabling touch-based vibrations, allowing users to feel and interpret data. With haptic feedback, they can \u201cview\u201d and comprehend digital information that was previously inaccessible to them.Staying Connected with Family, Friends and ColleaguesKnowing who is calling is a key facet of communication, but relying solely on voice announcements can compromise privacy in public places. Haptic vibration feedback discreetly notifies users of incoming calls, therefore preserving privacy while keeping people connected.User-FriendlinessUsability testing of Tencent\u2019s haptic technology and feedback from visually impaired users demonstrate their appreciation for such innovations. With a quick learning curve of around 30 minutes and an impressive information recognition rate of 90 percent, haptic feedback technology proves to be an effective additional solution. It expands the scope of barrier-free content, stimulates multiple senses, and creates a richer and more inclusive experience.Working Together to Create a Barrier-Free WorldThe adoption of haptic feedback technology, along with open-source initiatives, will pave the way for greater inclusivity and accessibility. Tencent's open patent licensing program allows the haptic patents to be openly used for accessbility applications. It also encourages the third-party developers to contribute and get involved and improves the overall ecosystem.While the visually impaired have been the main beneficiaries, vibration and tactile feedback technology can also assist the hearing impaired and the elderly. It is through these collaborative efforts that we can build a more inclusive society where every individual, regardless of their abilities, can live independently and participate effectively in a digital world.",

They said the company had also ordered almost 70,000 A800 chips to be delivered next year, worth about $US700 million.Alibaba plans to plug all its products into its large-language model, including its online shopping platform Taobao and its mapping tool Gaode Map.AdvertisementMeanwhile, Baidu is making its own ChatGPT-like project, a generative AI chatbot called Ernie Bot.Baidu, ByteDance, Tencent and Alibaba declined to comment.Nvidia said in a statement: \u201cConsumer internet companies and cloud providers invest billions of dollars on data centre components every year, often placing orders many months in advance.\u201dEarlier this year, as excitement about AI gathered momentum, most Chinese internet giants had less than a few thousand chips in stock that could be used to train large-language models, according to a number of Chinese tech company sources.As demand has grown since then, so too has the chips\u2019 cost. \u201cThe price of the A800 in the hands of distributors has risen by more than 50 per cent,\u201d one Nvidia distributor said.In April, Tencent Cloud released a new server cluster \u2014 computing power for others to rent \u2014 wielding the Nvidia H800 GPU, a version of its latest H100 model adapted for China, which can power large-language model training, autonomous driving and scientific computing.AdvertisementAlibaba Cloud has also received thousands of H800 chips from Nvidia, and many customers have contacted the company seeking cloud services powered by these chips to help them replicate ChatGPT in China, according to two Alibaba sources.ByteDance provides cloud computing devices with stockpiled Nvidia chips A800 and A100.

Among other things, \u201cnon-adult\u201d children won\u2019t be allowed to access the internet from mobile devices from 10:00 pm to 6:00 am, the agency said in a draft of rules published on its website. Other restrictions include a maximum of two hours\u2019 mobile usage for kids between the ages of 16 to 18.Beijing since 2021 has pursued campaigns to alleviate the burden on minors and their families and combat what it views as social ills. It imposed limits on online gaming for kids and declared for-profit after-school tutoring illegal, measures regarded as intended to both lessen financial burdens and promote healthier activities. At one point in 2021, state-backed media referred to gaming as \u201cspiritual opium.\u201dRead more: Xi\u2019s Big Private-Sector Push Runs Into Wall of SkepticismTencent\u2019s WeChat and ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s TikTok-like Douyin are among the most popular and heavily used internet services in China, attracting a disproportionate number of minors. The CAC didn\u2019t name any services except to say that platforms will be responsible for ensuring they meet the CAC\u2019s requirements, which include promoting lullabies for children under 3 and educational news and entertainment content to those under 12.Chinese technology shares were down in the late afternoon in Hong Kong, mostly extending losses from the morning. Kuaishou Technology, a short video service, slid about 4% while social media app Weibo Corp. shed more than 5% of its value. Tencent fell more than 3%. ByteDance, the world\u2019s most valuable startup, isn\u2019t publicly traded.Story continuesThe regulator said platform providers will be responsible for enforcement, although it didn\u2019t specify penalties for violations. Companies in China are typically held accountable for implementing such government regulations. Under previous rules limiting game play for minors, companies required real-name registrations for users and then introduced technology to cut off customers outside of authorized times.The agency specified certain measures to ensure compliance, including periodic checks and assessments, as well as access to both technology and data on request \u2014 not atypical requirements in China, which since 2021 has laid down legislation that gave the government greater control of data nationwide.\u201cTo strengthen protection of minors, in past years, the CAC has continued to push the construction of an internet model for youths, expanded its reach, improved its functions and enriched age-appropriate content,\u201d the agency said in the regulations, which seek public feedback and may change. \u201cThey\u2019ve had a positive impact in lessening youth internet addiction and curbing the impact of undesirable information.\u201dThe US Kids and Screen Time Debate: QuickTake(Updates with shares and details of enforcement from the fifth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "description": "Like most Chinese stocks, Tencent Holdings (TCEHY -0.22%) has been on a rough ride in recent years. After its share price reached an all-time high of nearly $100 in 2021, it lost almost three-quarters of its value, and it's still down by more than half.While its shareholders suffered during that period, contrarian investors can consider its aftermath an opportunity to buy shares of one of the best companies in China for cheap.Tencent's 2022 performance was disappointingTencent had been a hallmark of consistent and sustainable growth, with an unbroken track record of growth since it went public in 2004. So when the tech company reported that its revenue and operating profit fell by 1% and 13%, respectively, in 2022, investors would have found it difficult to swallow.Many factors contributed to that weak performance. One was that the company had become gigantic, generating 555 billion yuan ($79.6 billion) in revenue in 2022. It is quite natural for a company of that size to find it challenging to sustain high growth rates.But the bigger culprits were external factors such as China's economic weakness, which was caused in part by that nation's extended and strict COVID lockdowns. Other Chinese government policies also hurt Tencent's financials in 2022. For example, its regulatory crackdowns on the online education and tech industries have severely impacted Tencent's advertising and cloud income.Besides, in the name of common prosperity, the government has indirectly extracted 100 billion yuan (about $15.5 billion) from Tencent. While the Chinese government's new direction will not directly weaken Tencent's competitive advantage (more on this later), it certainly puts its future profitability at risk. Unfortunately, political risks are unavoidable when investing in Chinese companies.On a slightly positive note, Tencent has somewhat recovered from its 2022 woes. It delivered respectable first-quarter 2023 results, with revenue and operating profit up by 11% and 9%, so the worst is probably over for the company.Tencent's prospects remain brightTencent's 2022 results might have disappointed its longtime shareholders, but make no mistake. It still owns some of the best businesses in China.Take its social media networking business, WeChat. With 1.3 billion monthly active users (MAU), its user base includes almost everyone in China. And they use it not only for communication but also to access services such as online payments, ride-sharing, public transportation, entertainment, online gaming, and more. In a way, it's almost impossible for an average Chinese citizen to live in China without using WeChat and its ecosystem of services.With its dominant market position, Tencent has plenty of opportunities to profit from its captive users. To keep making money from its ecosystem, all it has to do is ensure that it remains the preferred communication platform in China. Fortunately, it is the only game in town, and it could keep that position for a while.If that's not enough, Tencent has proven to be an excellent tech investor, having bought stakes early on in what have become some of the region's most prominent companies. Pinduoduo, JD.com, Meituan, and Sea are just some examples.In other words, Tencent has twin engines of internal business and external investments to keep its growth machine humming.A quick word on valuationUsually, shares of a company of Tencent's caliber won't come cheap. But this stock -- still down by more than half from its 2021 peak -- is currently trading at a reasonable valuation.As of writing, Tencent's stock has a price-to-earnings ratio of 16. Its 5-year average ratio is 27. Besides, that existing metric doesn't consider the value of the vast investment portfolio ($117 billion ) the company owns. Adjusting for these investments would result in an even lower price-to-earnings ratio.In short, investors are not in favor of Tencent stock.So what it means for the rest of us?Tencent's recent business performance might not have been inspiring, but the issues that caused it difficulty are likely temporary.While it would be unrealistic to expect Tencent to keep growing at its prior rates -- given that it is now the 15th-largest public company in the world -- it would not be unreasonable for investors to expect growth to return to respectable rates soon, thanks to the twin engines it has to power it. Moreover, buying the stock at its current valuation poses no significant risk of permanent capital loss.Patient investors with investing horizons of more than five years should consider buying some shares.",

            "description": "Chinese tech giant Tencent has acquired Japanese game developer Visual Arts (Kabushikigaisha Bijuaru Atsu), a specialist in galgame (female anime character-based games) and visual novels. The Osaka-based developer announced the news on Chinese social platform Weibo on Thursday.Why it matters: With Tencent\u2019s acquisition, Visual Arts has said it will be able to reach a wider audience and explore new growth opportunities. Tencent, meanwhile, will further its aim of becoming a global gaming powerhouse by acquiring another reputable developer after a series of such moves in recent weeks.Details: Visual Arts\u2019 announcement on Thursday coincided with confirmation of the retirement of its founder Takahiro Baba, which was initially revealed last year.

Driven by our mission, we invest heavily in research and development and invent solutions that enhance business performance, help industry transform, promote sustainability, combat climate change, preserve culture and create barrier-free access to technology.In a new series, Tencent Innovates, we highlight a range of initiatives and cutting-edge advances that make a positive impact.1. Prioritizing Research and DevelopmentResearch and development (R&D) is the foundation of our culture of innovation. We have invested more than US$20 billion (RMB 150 billion) in R&D in the past three years. In Q1 of 2023 alone, our R&D spending is approximately US$2.1 billion, marking five consecutive quarters of high investment.This ongoing commitment to R&D enables us to stay on top of the rapidly evolving technology landscape.2. Empowering Creators and Fostering CreativityPatent protection is vital to safeguarding ideas and inventions and rewarding creators. Tencent's extensive and varied patent portfolio ensures a thriving innovation ecosystem.With over 1,300 patents for data security and 1,000 invention patents in AI medical care, we prioritize protecting critical innovation areas. Diversity is important to us: more than 22,000 patents involve female inventors, accounting for over 35 percent of the total.Globally, we have filed over 62,000 patent applications globally, ranking second among all internet companies for published patent applications worldwide.3. Helping the Hearing Impaired Through Enhanced Audio QualityBackground noise can hinder effective communication, especially for people with hearing impairments. To address this challenge, Tencent Teana Lab has developed advanced noise reduction technology that utilizes AI to enhance audio quality, minimize distracting background noise, and make speech clearer. The capabilities of this technology have earned it multiple technical championships.The technology improves the listening experience for everyone. It enables users with hearing difficulties to communicate more effectively, participate in conversations, and engage in audio-based activities with greater ease and enjoyment.4. Expanding Barrier-free Technology for the Visually ImpairedTencent is applying game technology to cut the digital divide for users with visual impairment s . Our \"Tactile Feedback Industry Standard and Six-dot Braille Vibration Solution\" is one of the latest projects to help them interact with digital devices, making text input and independent navigation easier. Tencent incorporates tactile feedback and vibrations into hundreds of millions mainstream mobile devices, helping millions of users easily interact with the digital world.What\u2019s more, we have opened patents for the relevant tactile feedback technology, allowing independent developers and manufacturers to use it in philanthropy projects. In doing so, we are expanding barrier-free technology not only for the visually impaired, but empowering all users to participate fully in the digital realm.5. Improving Digital Inclusion and Online Safety for SeniorsTencent has prioritized improving digital accessibility and online safety for seniors. Initiatives include creating user-friendly interfaces with alerts, simple text, and audio to minimize errors and boost user confidence. We offer training programs that enhance online safety and make it easier for seniors to navigate the digital world.Five Tencent products and website have been officially recognized in China for their contribution to making the internet into a barrier-free environment for the elderly.6. Supporting Innovative Solutions for a Sustainable Low-carbon FutureThe CarbonX Program is an initiative aimed at reducing carbon emissions and fostering a more sustainable future.Through the program, we invest in innovative technologies and collaborate with industry partners to develop effective solutions for carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). It supports advanced technology pilots and empowers CCUS startups to make significant emissions reductions.Tencent has also worked with Carbfix, a leading Icelandic carbon storage company. Together, we are working to establish a pioneering carbon dioxide mineralization storage project. This initiative captures carbon dioxide emissions and converts them into stable minerals, effectively storing them underground and preventing their release into the atmosphere.7. Improving Pilot Training and Aviation SafetyIn collaboration with China Southern Airlines(CSAIR), Tencent has launched an advanced full flight simulator visual system. It utilizes our game engine, regenerative procedural content generation (PCG), AI-generated content (AIGC) and other gaming technologies to recreate natural environments, resulting in a 10-times increase in asset production efficiency and a 100-times increase in the texture fineness compared to existing systems. These advancements lead to significant time savings, in addition to halving over 50 percent of the production cost.With CSAIR wide-angle infinity display technology, the system can reach the strict industrial standard of 4K 60FPS, zero frame loss and zero lag when running in real-time, making more realistic imaging, efficient modeling and stable operation.The visual system also enhances the efficiency and quality of civil aviation pilot training. The simulator offers an immersive and lifelike experience with hundreds of training disciplines, allowing trainee pilots to develop and refine their skills within a safe and controlled environment. The impact of this innovation extends beyond individual pilots and benefits the entire aviation industry.8. Transforming the Smart Auto Industry Through Cloud TechnologyTencent's advanced smart auto cloud capabilities are transforming the car industry and driving experience, with services provided to more than 100 car and travel technology companies and collaborations with 600 ecological partners.Our cloud-on-cloud self-driving storage solution offers numerous benefits to the industry, including increased capacity, faster AI training, and an average storage cost reduction of 50 percent.Users also benefit from high-precision mapping covering 50 cities, faster updates for voice interactions, and advanced voice assistant features. These enhancements contribute to an improved driving experience, making journeys safer and more convenient.9. Preserving Cultural Heritage for Future GenerationsTencent and the Dunhuang Research Academy have joined forces to create a new type of interactive museum, known as the \"Dunhuang Digital Library Cave.\" This pioneering project utilizes advanced game technology, including high-definition digital photo scanning, game engine rendering, dynamic lighting, and cloud gaming to preserve about 60,000 volumes of invaluable cultural relics. It brings the historical scenes of 66 scripture caves and their precious relics to life.The Digital Library Cave serves as a bridge between tradition and modern technology, making heritage and history accessible to a wider audience. It provides an immersive platform for cultural exploration, inviting a new generation to delve into the captivating world of ancient caves and artifacts.",

Vice-premier Ding Xuexiang was also in attendance.Major internet platforms have been under intense regulatory scrutiny over the past two and half years, as Beijing moved to curb the \"irrational\" expansion of capital and pursue common prosperity.The process saw trillions of dollars wiped off company valuations, thousands of jobs eliminated, and the gap between Chinese and US tech giants widened.But Beijing's attitude took a big turn in late 2022, as it began to highlight the positive role played by internet platforms.Liquid cooled servers on display at the Enflame Technology booth at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai last week.

Alibaba and Meituan both received big fines for abusing their market positions, while Tencent was punished multiple times for failing to report previous merger deals.From January to May, profits of Chinese internet firms surged 43 per cent, reaching 57.6 billion yuan (US$7.9 billion), according to a report released by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology last month.Hong Kong shares of Alibaba closed at HK$89.85 on Wednesday, up 1.24 per cent. In its latest research note, brokerage UOB KayHian set a HK$130 target for Alibaba, implying a nearly 45 per cent upside from the current value.Tencent closed at HK$340, up 1.86 per cent, while Meituan ended the day at HK$127.3, a rise of 4.34 per cent.Tracy Qu contributed reportingThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

It\u2019s said a portion of Meta\u2019s global offerings could be on offer alongside Tencent\u2019s own apps and services.In 2009, Facebook and Twitter were banned in China after breaching Beijing\u2019s notoriously strict censorship laws; the ban is thought to have been a direct effort to quel the July 2009 \u00dcr\u00fcmqi riots that took place in the country\u2019s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.More recently, Chinese executives were allegedly worried that Zuckerberg isn\u2019t seen as \u201cfriendly to China\u201d due to lingering tentions over prior accusations of technology theft by companies such as ByteDance, maker of TikTok.A Meta spokesman declined to comment on WSJ\u2019s report. Tencent didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.This isn\u2019t the first time Meta VR hardware has made a splash on the Chinese mainland. In 2018, Meta (then Facebook) penned a deal with Xiaomi to release a Chinese variant of Oculus Go, sold by Xiaomi as the \u2018Mi VR Standalone\u2019. At the time, this was something of a quid pro quo, as Xiaomi was tasked with manufacturing Oculus Go, giving it exclusive rights to the mainland Chinese market as a result.No such manufacturing deal is in place with Meta Quest 3, which is coming this Fall for $500. In the end, Meta\u2019s current strategy seems less about getting its subsidized hardware into the country, and more about driving a wedge into the Great Chinese Firewall so it can once again tap into the world\u2019s fastest-growing economy.",

That security enjoyed a very pleasant price pop of more than 4% on the day following the note's publication, a rise that easily beat the S&P 500 index's 0.7% advance.So whatWhat helped was that the analyst in question works at a very high-profile bank. He's Alex Yao of JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.23%), and he reiterated his overweight (read: buy) recommendation on Tencent. His price target for the company's Hong Kong-listed shares is 440 Hong Kong dollars, which converts to $56.21. That's well above the current price of the ADRs, which stands at $44.81 apiece.Tencent, a sprawling tech company based in mainland China, is the world's largest video game publisher. It's also the company behind the immensely popular WeChat online ecosystem that marries a host of tech functionalities to fintech services. Finally, it controls the near-eponymous Tencent Music and is very active in the cloud computing sphere.Yet its stock has been something of a yo-yo lately. It suffered from a long crackdown on the domestic tech sector by Chinese authorities, who were particularly concerned with the video game industry. China was also, of course, hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.Now whatIt wasn't clear why Yao maintained his bullishness on Tencent in the face of its recent challenges. Despite those headwinds, though, the company remains a powerful force in many segments of the country's tech scene. Additionally, the government finally seems to be relenting on the tech crackdown generally and its video gaming worries specifically. Tencent could sure benefit from a more relaxed regulatory environment.",

He also said he previously interned at ByteDance and Huawei.WeChat is the most popular instant messaging app in China, with 1.3 billion active monthly users, and in addition to storing account data, keeps sensitive financial information for its online payment services.Tencent had not responded to the Post\u2019s questions at the time of writing.The scandal came to light after an unidentified person posted screenshots of the appearance rating website RUC IR FACE on the university\u2019s internal student forum, causing anger among students.One of the screenshots of Ma\u2019s ranking website that led to his eventual arrest after they were shared online. Photo: The PaperStudents were shocked that the website not only scored female and male students using their stolen photo IDs but also published students\u2019 private information, including names, student numbers and their hometowns.Online searches of the website\u2019s name uncovered a Weibo account that said in a 2020 post they had \u201cdone the wrong thing that I have always wanted to do since sophomore year\u201d, with a screenshot of the ratings website attached.The Weibo account owner had included his real name in his account details, and it was soon discovered that there were multiple social media accounts held by the male owner, surnamed Ma.The case has parallels to the 2003 website Facemash, the predecessor of Facebook. Photo: ShutterstockAccording to Ma\u2019s account on the Chinese question-and-answer website Zhihu, he graduated from the university\u2019s computer science master\u2019s programme and worked on developing the school\u2019s outcome-based education system.Ma also said he was awarded a national scholarship and merit student honour at the university.The ranking website, which was up for three years, is similar in design and function to Facemash, the predecessor of Facebook that Mark Zuckerberg built in 2003 using the ID photos of Harvard students.Under Chinese law, Ma could face imprisonment of up to seven years.The case has renewed debate about the online exploitation of private data, with some criticising the university for failing to protect students\u2019 personal information.In 2021, an artist, named Song Ta, triggered public furore after re-exhibiting a self-proclaimed artwork he did in 2013, in which he secretly filmed thousands of female students on a Chinese university campus and ranked them \u201cfrom the prettiest to the ugliest\u201d.The institution that exhibited the work, OCAT Shanghai, later apologised and removed the work.",

            "description": "Meta has reportedly turned to China\u2019s Tencent to resurrect its business in that country.A potential roadblock to the tech giant\u2019s efforts, however, could be its CEO\u2019s apparent views on China, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday (July 3).Sources tell the newspaper that Meta\u2019s efforts \u2014 to sell its Quest virtual reality headsets in China \u2014 face an obstacle, in part because executives there are concerned Mark Zuckerberg isn\u2019t seen as being friendly to the nation.For example, Zuckerberg has accused China of stealing technology, criticized TikTok owner ByteDance and refused to comply with the government\u2019s censorship rules. This could create uncertainty if the company and Tencent were to pursue licenses and approvals in China.PYMNTS has contacted Meta and Tencent for comment but has not yet received a reply. The WSJ report notes that a partnership could benefit both Tencent \u2014 the largest video game publisher in the world \u2014 and Meta, which could tap the Chinese market to recover some of the billions it has spent on its metaverse project.The news follows last week\u2019s announcement by Meta of a new subscription service for games on its virtual reality (VR) headsets.Subscribers will get access to two titles per month that can be redeemed on the internet, in a headset or via the Meta Quest app.PYMNTS wrote in March that Meta had sold about 20 million of its $400 Quest 2 headsets since 2020 and had slashed the price of the Quest Pro, its premium device, from $1,500 to $1,000 amid lackluster sales.The VR industry was apparently more excited about the impending launch of Apple\u2019s mixed-reality Vision Pro headset.As noted here earlier this month Tipatat Chennavasin, co-founder of the Venture Reality Fund, called the Apple headset \u201cthe next ecosystem where millions of developers are making millions of dollars selling to billions of people.\u201dHowever, that project too has run into roadblocks, according to reports Monday that Apple had lowered its production forecast for the headset and paused plans for a more affordable version of the $3,500 device.\u201cApple\u2019s fan base and others who can afford Vision Pro\u2019s hefty price tag may be waiting for the product\u2019s eventual launch, but it is too soon to say if the broader consumer population will buy in,\u201d PYMNTS wrote last month.\u201cGiven the similar concerns about high consumer costs for Vision Pro\u2019s predecessors \u2014 and their relatively low costs in comparison to Apple\u2019s offering \u2014 the wearable prospects for future success are murky, even though many of the augmented reality innovations stemming from these wearables could have real-world benefits.\u201d",

Mark Zuckerberg/InstagramHis recent outreach to Tencent may be necessitated by Apple\u2019s entry into the Zuckerberg-dominated metaverse. Apple, which topped $3 trillion in market cap last week, unveiled an augmented reality headset called the Vision Pro.The headset\u2019s $3,499 price tag is three times the cost of the priciest headset from Meta.The social media company\u2019s flagship VR headset Meta Quest Pro is currently priced at $999.99, down from its launch price of $1,499.99, and Quest 2 is being sold for $299.99, according to Meta\u2019s website.Meta in March had cut the prices of its headsets as its bold bets on the metaverse failed to make a big splash.3 Zuckerberg is said to be holding talks with Chinese tech firm Tencent on a partnership to market Meta\u2019s VR headsets. Getty Images for SXSWIn 2021, Zuckerberg wondered aloud why US tech unicorns such as Tesla and Apple could freely peddle their wares in China while his company was shut out from the Asian giant, The Journal reported.He has also hit out at TikTok\u2019s Chinese-owned parent company ByteDance, which has eaten into Facebook\u2019s user base.In 2019, Zuckerberg told students at Georgetown University that TikTok posed a threat to American values and did not share Facebook\u2019s commitment to free expression, The Journal reported.Zuckerberg is also reported to have personally lobbied then-President Donald Trump as well as lawmakers on Capitol Hill over the potential danger that Chinese tech companies presented to American businesses.\u201cI think it\u2019s well-documented that the Chinese government steals technology from American companies,\u201d Zuckerberg told House leaders.3 Zuckerberg in years past has spoken critically of Chinese tech firms. Chinese President Xi Jinping is pictured. APLast year, it was learned that Meta hired a top GOP consulting firm to gin up rage against TikTok and deflect political scrutiny away from its two main social media platforms \u2014 Facebook and Instagram.TikTok has been the subject of intense scrutiny from lawmakers over its Chinese corporate parent\u2019s links to the ruling Communist Party in Beijing.TikTok and ByteDance have long denied claims that American users\u2019 data is vulnerable to collection by the Chinese government.",

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration Acquire Licensing RightsSummaryCompanies Company introduced cross-holding structure two years agoRemoval of structure will help in continuing buyback, it saidAnnual profit fell to $10 bln on lower Tencent contributionJOHANNESBURG, June 27 (Reuters) - Dutch-listed technology investor Prosus NV (PRX.AS), said on Tuesday it would end a cross-holding structure with its South African parent Naspers (NPNJn.J), sending both companies' stock higher as investors welcomed the simplification.\"They (shareholder) said we don't like this cross holding, it creates complexity. We've listened to them. And we're basically getting rid of that now,\" CEO Bob van Dijk told Reuters in an interview.The announcement sent shares of both the companies up almost 10% in early trade. The companies also reported full year earnings which showed a fall in profit due to lower earnings at China's Tencent (0700.HK), in which Prosus holds a 26% stake.The cross-holding had been set up in 2021 via a share swap deal under which Prosus issued new shares to buy a 45.4% stake in Naspers, effectively moving part of Naspers from the Johannesburg bourse to Euronext in Amsterdam.The deal had been aimed at shrinking a discount between the value of the two companies and that of their biggest asset Tencent, a software, gaming and social media giant.It also reduced the weight of Naspers on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) where it had made up more than 25% of blue chip indexes.However it did not reduce the discount, forcing the company to launch a share buy back scheme last year which has had more success.Several minority shareholders of Naspers were irked at the complexity of the cross holding.Van Dijk said the removal of the cross-holding structure means the company will be now able to continue share buy-backs for \"many, many years\".The company currently holds around $10 billion in cash.\"It is a relief that the group is reversing some of the previous convoluted structuring,\" said Richard Cheesman, senior investment analyst with asset manager Protea Capital Management.\"It is unfortunate that it has been such a long journey with significant costs along the way,\" he added.Prosus' net profit for the year ended March 31 fell to $10 billion from $18.6 billion, mostly due to Tencent.Among e-commerce companies Prosus considers part of its core operations, revenue grew by 10% to $5.8 billion, the company said, while its trading loss increased to $617 million.Reporting by Toby Sterling and Promit Mukherjee; editing by Edmund Klamann, Jason Neely and David EvansOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "description": "The company shares marketing insights and trends to help luxury brands reach consumers in China more effectivelyConsumers in China are more digitally entrenched than ever. Average mobile internet usage clocked in at nearly six hours a day in 2022, around 30 percent higher than the global average, and the figure continues to rise. Navigating through the endless churn of online offerings, Chinese consumers have become discerning connoisseurs of enriching, integrated content that seamlessly satisfies their appetite for social interaction, entertainment, authentic information and engaging retail experiences. The changing landscape is a reflection of rapid digital transformation in recent years to enhance customer experiences and drive business growth.Kiki Fan, General Manager of Industrial Sales Operations, Tencent Marketing Solution, provided valuable insights into China\u2019s fast-changing digital market and evolving consumer behaviors in a keynote speech on June 21 to leading advertisers at the prestigious Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity in the south of France. Fan also shared new trends for strategies in the digital space that help brands achieve successful marketing results.\u201cAccelerated growth in online engagement and purchasing is driven by continuous innovation in China's digital ecosystem. It is unique in its extraordinary connectivity and diversity, with an array of different media and engagement formats,\u201d Fan explained.\u201cTaking Tencent\u2019s Weixin platform as an example, we have progressed a long way from being a promotional channel to becoming a business enabler, where brands can combine their websites featuring advertising and sales services with social media to interact directly with customers in an integrated manner.\u201dSome noteworthy new trends in China\u2019s digital marketing space highlighted by Fan include a shift towards online live streaming of events that breaks the boundaries of location, capacity and time; digitalizing offline content that fuels social interaction; creating immersive personalized experiences in the metaverse; and launching new formats such as vertical video or interactive content. More brands are also leveraging Weixin as a key business platform, setting up \u2018Always-on Mini Program Stores\u2019 to provide a diverse range of products that are available all year round. The incorporation of technology like augmented reality helps to make the shopping experience more visual and realistic. Fan summed this up with a concept dubbed \"brand.com 2.0,\" which signifies that brands can leverage all the consumer touchpoints to complete a seamless online journey.On the eve of the event, Tencent Marketing Insight (TMI) published a research report on the Chinese luxury market entitled \u201cA New Chapter to Digital Future: Report on Digital Trends of China\u2019s Luxury Market,\u201d* with analysis from the Boston Consulting Group (BCG).Other than substantiating the points made by Fan on the latest digital marketing trends in China, the TMI report pointed out that luxury brands would find opportunity in three key consumer segments: heavy spenders, Gen-Z and customers in tier two and below cities. Together, they are forecast to account for 70 percent of future growth in the sector. Furthermore, digital channels would be an indispensable part of any marketing strategy as they influence over 90 percent of all luxury purchases in the country. More significantly, 46 percent of all luxury transactions are now completed online, compared with only 29 percent in 2019.Overall, the report notes that the outlook is promising for the luxury market in China. Year-on-year, Chinese consumer spending in the sector is expected to grow a robust 15 to 20 percent in 2023 to RMB550 billion (US $77 billion). Some 80 percent of that spending will be domestic, due in part to prolonged constraints in international travel. More telling though, is a shift in consumer preference to buy at home as a result of improved product range and supply, better service and narrowing price gaps. Brands are also fostering stronger bonds with domestic customers by incorporating Chinese elements and themes in their products and communication.The report finds that Chinese luxury customers appreciate diverse, innovative marketing approaches that resonate and connect with them directly. They consider luxury brands that incorporate traditional elements to be more genuine. Tailor-made campaigns for the China market such as those celebrating Lunar New Year and Chinese Valentines Day have been particularly well-received. Creativity, energy, use of local celebrity endorsers, application of new technology such as virtual idols, integrated online/offline activities and collaboration with non-luxury brands all help boost the appeal and enhance a brand\u2019s standing, especially among younger Chinese consumers.Social commerce is a new buzzword for both luxury and non-luxury brands charting a roadmap for growth in China\u2019s vast and diverse market. Digitally advanced consumers are demanding seamless online customer journeys that connect them across multiple touch points. As well, they seek ever more innovative and sophisticated content that resonates deeply and directly. In the rapidly changing digital landscape, marketers may turn to next-generation intelligent tools to more precisely analyse consumer behavior and maximize the efficiency of marketing efforts.*Due to differing consumer behavior and tariffs, the report covers only consumers in Chinese mainland. Consumer behavior in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan are not tracked. Research Sample: 2,700 luxury brand shoppers between April 2022 and April 2023",

            "description": "Yijing LiuInvestment thesisThis year, Tencent's (OTCPK:TCEHY) stock significantly underperformed the U.S. stock market and many investors might think that the stock is undervalued. However, my valuation analysis suggests that the current share price looks overvalued. Moreover, the company is in a secular decline in profitability metrics which I consider a red flag. The latest quarter was stronger YoY, but I need a few more quarters of a clear profitability improvement path before I change my \"Hold\" rating.Company informationTencent is a Chinese conglomerate founded in 1998. Since then, the company has grown into one of the world's largest companies with a diverse portfolio of businesses, including social media, entertainment, gaming, e-commerce, and financial services. Its flagship platform, WeChat, has become an integral part of daily life for millions.The company operates five segments: Social Networks, Domestic Games, International Games, Online Advertising, and FinTech & Business Services [FBS]. According to the latest earnings presentation, FBS revenue represented almost a third.Author's calculationsFinancialsTencent demonstrated stellar revenue growth over the past decade with a 23% CAGR. The first red flag that I see is that the gross margin deteriorated notably, despite a nine-fold increase in revenue. The operating margin also softened substantially from 29% to 16%. Expanding profitability metrics while the business scales up is crucial for me as a long-term investor.Author's calculationsThe free cash flow [FCF] margin without stock-based compensation [SBC] also deteriorated significantly over the past decade, which is the second big red flag for me. Some people might argue that the company invests heavily in CAPEX to fuel long-term growth. But CAPEX was decreasing over the past three years while the FCF margin deteriorated from 18% to 8%, which is massive.Data by YChartsThe key to the shrinking FCF margin is in the cash flow from operations [CFO]. In the below table, you can see that the CFO margin deteriorated significantly over the past three years and is currently at the lowest point in the decade. Therefore, I have a high conviction that the company's operating efficiency is deteriorating rapidly.Author's calculationsNow let me narrow down my financial analysis to the quarterly level. The latest quarterly earnings were released on May 17. The company delivered higher-than-expected revenue but missed on the EPS.Seeking AlphaRevenue grew at about 2% YoY. This can be considered a positive sign because, in the previous three quarters, the company demonstrated a YoY decline in sales. The positive sign is also that profitability metrics improved compared to the Q1 of 2022. On the other hand, profitability ratios are still weaker than the ones demonstrated during the Q1 of 2021.Seeking AlphaThe positive trend is expected to continue in Q2 of the current fiscal year. Consensus expects revenue at about $21.2 billion, indicating a 7% YoY growth. It is important to note that EPS is expected to expand from $0.43 to $0.61. Tencent's financial performance is likely to demonstrate strong momentum. However, I need a couple more quarters to have a conviction that the company is on the path to sustainable profitability improvement.Tencent's balance sheet looks in good shape, with robust liquidity ratios and a substantial outstanding cash balance. The leverage ratio is conservative, though the company is in a net debt position.The company returns money to shareholders via stock buybacks and dividends. In FY 2022, the company spent about $4.7 billion on a share repurchase program. On the other hand, the dividend yield is not attractive since the TTM yield is below 1%.Seeking AlphaValuationTCEHY stock price demonstrated a 5% year-to-date decline. The stock significantly underperformed both the broader U.S. market. On the other hand, the iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI) demonstrated weaker performance with a 9% decline. Seeking Alpha Quant assigns TCEHY the lowest possible \"F\" valuation grade. This is due to the high multiples compared to the sector median. On the other hand, 5-year average valuation ratios are higher than the current multiples.Seeking AlphaI consider Tencent's dividend yield low and do not have enough confidence regarding the dividend growth rate. Therefore I will not use a discounted dividend model approach for TCEHY. I implement the discounted cash flow [DCF] approach to cross-check valuation multiples instead. I use a high 15% discount rate for the valuation of Chinese companies due to inherent political risks. For a base case scenario, I expect revenue growth at a 7% CAGR over the next decade. I expect a 7.5% FCF margin for FY 2023 that will expand by two percentage points yearly.Author's calculationsAs you can see, based on the above assumptions, the DCF template returns a business's fair value at about $354 billion. It means the stock is about 13% overvalued. Tencent bulls might argue that the discount rate is unfairly high, so let me simulate a scenario with a lower WACC. For the second scenario, let me use a 12% WACC. Other assumptions are unchanged.Author's calculationsI think that even under a much less tight WACC, the stock still does not look attractively valued. I think that a 7% upside potential is unlikely to be worth the risk.Risks to considerTencent is one of the largest Chinese companies, therefore there is a substantial risk related to anti-trust issues. Anti-trust regulations' goal is to promote fair competition and prevent monopolistic practices. Given Tencent's dominant position in numerous sectors, including social media, gaming, and fintech, there is a significant risk that regulators may impose restrictions or initiate investigations to ensure a fair game for competitors. Regulatory actions could adversely affect Tencent's business operations and financial performance.The company is highly dependent on its key platforms and the closer they are to full saturation, the fewer options to drive sustainable revenue growth the company will have. Yes, the company invests in many new ventures, but there is no guarantee that these investments will ultimately pay off.Bottom lineTo conclude, I do not consider Tencent a good investment option. The main reason is the current valuation, which I consider unattractive. The second important reason is that my financial analysis revealed secular weaknesses the company is experiencing. In companies with strong growth potential, profitability metrics have to improve as the business scales up. Looking back at the company's financials over the past decade, we can see that it was vice-versa for Tencent. Therefore, I assign TCEHY stock a \"Hold\" rating.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.Tencent Cloud's LLM solutions will cater to industries ranging from finance, media, travel to education, with clients including China's state media China Media Group, the Shanghai University, and Fujian Big Data Group among others, according to the WeChat post.Together with clients, the company has launched over 50 LLM-enabled industrial solutions covering over 10 industries, Tang Daosheng said at the event, a senior executive vice-president at Tencent and chief executive of its cloud and smart industries group.\"Tencent will keep opening its ecosystem to provide quality [LLM] services for corporate clients,\" said Tang, who added that the company will assist its clients in training multimodels and speed up exploration of applying LLMs in more industrial scenarios.Tencent's foray into the local LLM arena will pit it against rivals including Baidu and Alibaba Group Holding, which are both looking to roll out their respective LLM applications for wider adoption among many businesses. Alibaba owns the Post.Story continuesChatGPT's success has goaded global tech firms into an artificial intelligence (AI) arms race, with Chinese Big Tech firms falling over themselves to develop rival services.Baidu was among the first domestic firms to launch a competitor service called Ernie Bot in March, with a promise to embed the AI chatbot into its existing services, including search.At the March launch event, the Chinese search engine giant said that more than 650 companies have signed up to embed Ernie Bot into their services.Alibaba's cloud business, meanwhile, has also started baking its ChatGPT-like artificial intelligence (AI) into a range of service offerings, including meeting assistant Tingwu and Slack-like office collaboration platform DingTalk.Other than the industrial LLM service launched on Monday, Tencent is also working on a foundational AI model dubbed Hunyuan, which is yet to be released. Tencent founder and CEO Pony Ma Huateng, said earlier that his company was in no rush to launch unfinished products.\"[AI] is a once-in-a-century opportunity like the invention of electricity during the industrial revolution,\" Ma said at the company's latest earnings call in May.\"In the grand scheme of things, introducing the light bulb a month earlier wasn't that important.

The cluster features Tencent's self-developed StarLake server and Nvidia's latest H800 GPU \u2014 the first of its kind in China \u2014 ensures optimal performance, high bandwidth, and minimal latency, thereby facilitating large model training, autonomous driving, and scientific computing.The company is focused on broadening the scope of China's LLM ecosystem through active collaboration with clients and partners. Together with its clients, Tencent has introduced over 50 LLM-powered industrial solutions spanning more than ten industries, as revealed by Tang Daosheng, a senior executive vice-president at Tencent and chief executive of its cloud and smart industries group, at the MaaS launch event.\"We will assist its clients in training multimodels and speed up exploration of applying LLMs in more industrial scenarios,\" said the executive.Major Chinese cloud providers such as Alibaba and Baidu are also seizing these opportunities by launching a suite of LLM-enabled cloud services.Other than the industrial LLM service launched on Monday, Tencent announced that it will soon launch an AI assistant for online meetings, providing services such as key information extraction, taking meeting notes, content analysis, and meeting management; as well as an AI code assistant offering a copilot service similar to GitHub's.",

It sees MoreFun bringing a hardcore shooter experience to mobile, similar to titles such as Escape from Tarkov. The title will begin in soft launch in Brazil and the Philippines beginning on June 26.The official description of the game reads, \u201cIn Arena Breakout, players will put boots on the ground in Kamona, a no man\u2019s land recently torn apart by civil war. Search the combat area for a chance to strike it rich, but be prepared to fight for survival. Other operatives, squads, militants and scavengers are out there turning over everything for a piece of the pie, so it\u2019s up to you to choose when to fight or disengage. Build and modify ultra-realistic guns, patch your wounds, and refill your empty mags in preparation for the fight ahead. Each battle is a high-risk, winner-takes-all gamble, so don\u2019t bring what you\u2019re not willing to lose.\u201dSoftly softly, launchy launchyThe most notable aspect about Arena Breakout is how it\u2019s billing itself as a hardcore shooter. Titles such as Escape From Tarkov are notoriously punishing for players, but have earned loyal fan bases as a result. While it may seem unusual to bring such a hardcore experience to what is commonly accepted to be a more casual mobile marketplace, it does reflect that there is a potential audience for whom games like Tarkov are not an option (as it\u2019s currently only available on PC) or perhaps simply not convenient enough. But it seems that MoreFun believes Arena Breakout will meet a hunger for difficult but rewarding gameplay.It also should be noted that Tencent are focusing their efforts in soft launch on Brazil and the Philippines. The former is of course where the company recently pushed their mega-hit MOBA Honor of Kings, to good reception, and the Philippines remains closer to their home market of China while being out of the reach of its strict regulatory measures. However, the Chinese gaming giant has faced other difficulties in markets such as India due to a tense political atmosphere.",

Since 2013, more than 300 Tencent employees have volunteered to travel to the remote Tengger Desert in northwestern China to plant trees to stop the desert from encroaching on what little arable land exists there.Their efforts have seen more than 600 acres, or the equivalent of over 300 football fields covered in hardy Haloxylon, or saxaul trees, with a remarkable 85 percent survival rate of saplings.This project not only showcases Tencent\u2019s commitment to environmental protection and social good. It has also been a valuable team bonding exercise, taking volunteers on a rewarding journey of camaraderie and self-discovery along the way.Below is an edited extract of a daily journal kept by one of the volunteers. It is a personal account of how the project works in action and the highs and lows, challenges and rewards that come with such an ambitious initiative.Day 1: Strangers Gather in the DesertEach year, a group of Tencent employees journeys to China\u2019s northwest to plant trees in the Tengger Desert, a faraway but ecologically important area.A group of 40 gathered from across China to fly from Lanzhou airport to Tenggar Desert, where we will be camping. Once there, it was straight down to business.Two local teachers shared the history of the region and today\u2019s challenges. They told us about the principles of sand control and the importance of saxaul trees, which are drought-resistant, work as shelter belts, help stabilize sand dunes and store water. We learned that the fruits of previous efforts can already be seen, with some small wildlife returning to the desert.Equipped with shovels and gloves, we dig pits, which have been carefully marked out, plant seedlings, and water the trees. Despite the scorching sun, we work hard, regularly reviewing to ensure everything is done correctly to maximize the survival of the saplings.The volunteers are planting trees at the designated locations.Day 2: Sandstorms, Cleaning and RebuildingOvernight \u2013 disaster! A powerful sandstorm swept through the camp, damaging tents and covering the site in sand. Howling wind prevented some of us from sleeping. When day broke, we worked to clear the sand and repair tents. Breakfast was prepared with limited resources, and demonstrated the volunteers\u2019 resilience and creativity.To get through, we shared stories and found a sense of community in the desert. Watering the freshly dug tree pits became a therapeutic experience, with volunteers focusing on each pit\u2019s transformation and nurturing tree growth. There is an art and science to watering plants that can only be learned by doing it. After the storm, the need to combat desertification became even clearer, making us more determined to create a greener future.Day 3: Finding RhythmAs the tree planting continued, the physical toll of 12-hour work days became evident. Fatigue, sunburn and minor injuries occurred, but with support and encouragement, we pushed forward, finding our own rhythm to focus on quality work. Faced with the daunting prospect of two more days of round-the-clock planting under the scorching sun, endurance became a test and we dreamed of our next shower.Day 4: Witnessing the Result of Past EffortsOnce again, howling winds overnight disrupted our sleep and forced many of us to move to the large communal tent. We waited for the wind to subside, but it persisted throughout much of the next day, causing us to change our plans. It was another reminder of the power of nature in the desert.Although the idea of losing another day of planting was frustrating, we found other ways to make the most of our precious time, gathering in the big communal tent to get to know each other better. Common traits united us: caring, action-oriented, hungry for knowledge and energetic.When the wind subsided in the afternoon, we visited the \u201cTencent Forest\u201d of camps and woodlands where previous volunteers had planted trees. The once barren land had transformed into a thriving forest. Veteran volunteers could see how the trees had slowly grown. Sitting on the sandy slope, we felt a deep connection with those who came before us.Day 5: The Fruits of Our LaborOn our last full day\u2019s afternoon, we visited Sifang Pier, a historic landmark dating back thousands of years to the Han Dynasty, which used to be a long way from the planting site. The edge of the forest has expanded to be closer to it, and we were able to walk over to the pier.We climbed the pier, which boasted panoramic views of the desert, and it allowed us to see how tall the oldest trees had grown and how much progress has been made. Visiting Sifang Pier and the place where the first tree was planted in 2013 brought a real sense of accomplishment and awe.As we bid farewell to the desert, we reflect on the past decade and the growth of our volunteer team. The memories and achievements will forever be preserved in the trees and fallen tree trunks. With the spirit of Tencent driving us, we leave the desert with a sense of pride and hope for the future.During our final meeting, we shared love and beauty in the intensity and peace that coexisted in the desert. We let go of the past, embraced the present and looked forward to the future.A group photo of the Tencent volunteers.Day 6: Farewells and Memories to Last a LifetimeWe packed up our belongings, clean the camp and say our goodbyes with a mix of reluctance and sadness.We came as volunteers but leave as friends, 40 individuals from across the country who joined hands to plant 10,000 trees in the Tengger Desert and leave small seeds of change in the vast desert.As we return to our own lives, we carry our stories and growth with us. The bonds we formed with our teammates, the moments of shared experiences and the memories we created will remain with us. The seeds we planted, both literal and metaphorical, will continue to thrive within us.",

            "description": "Simply sign up to the Chinese business & finance myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.Chinese online entertainment platform Bilibili was worth $54bn two years ago, as Wall Street investors rushed to bet on the rising tech giant.Today, the Nasdaq-listed group\u2019s market capitalisation has fallen to about $6.5bn, a collapse that has brought forward debt repayments that threaten to sap its remaining cash, leading to drastic cost-cutting at the company.Bilibili\u2019s travails are symptomatic of broader problems across the Chinese tech scene. Overseas investors are selling shares even in profitable internet giants such as Tencent and Alibaba, while becoming reluctant to back the country\u2019s most promising start-ups.Venture capital giant Sequoia Capital last week became the latest group to bow to rising geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington, announcing a plan to split its China business into a separate entity.Adding to the flight of foreign capital is an unsteady economic recovery that has deflated Chinese tech stocks that had briefly jumped on hopes for the country\u2019s post-coronavirus pandemic reopening. The downward trend has left employees and investors concerned that the depressed valuations for Chinese tech groups listed in New York and Hong Kong may be long-lasting.\u201cChina is getting cancelled and the economy is a dumpster fire,\u201d said a Hong Kong-based equity analyst. He noted that JPMorgan Chase\u2019s controversial labelling of Chinese internet stocks as \u201cuninvestable\u201d last year now looked better judged.The trend is even hurting cash-rich groups such as Tencent and Alibaba, which have tightened their belts and funnelled savings into share buybacks. Employees at those companies said endless cycles of cost-cutting and sinking pay had hit staff morale.Recent positive financial updates from the internet giants have done little to lift their stock prices, with Tencent shares down 19 per cent and Alibaba\u2019s down 29 per cent from January highs.Since the start of the pandemic, China\u2019s 10 largest tech groups have collectively lost $300bn in market value, while their largest US peers have added almost $5tn, according to S&P Capital IQ.For many investors, spiralling US-China tensions are a constant reminder of the fate of those who backed Russian companies, with billions of dollars of value evaporating soon after Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, leading to crippling western sanctions.Adding to the complexity are Washington\u2019s possible expansion of restrictions on US investment in China, which would add to export controls designed to limit Beijing\u2019s access to vital technologies such as advanced semiconductors and chipmaking equipment.Big foreign investors are backing off as a result, including western pension funds that have historically been leading backers of Chinese tech in both private and public markets.The Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan, Canada\u2019s third-largest pension fund, had almost $1bn invested in shares of Alibaba and Tencent two years ago. Neither company ranks among its top investments today and the group recently cut its Hong Kong-based team, which led such deals.Warren Buffett has quietly sold down more than half his stake in Chinese electric car group BYD over the past year. Buffett bought and then promptly sold a large stake in TSMC, the Taiwanese chipmaker, this year after re-evaluating \u201cits location\u201d at the centre of a potential US-China geopolitical flashpoint.Winnie Wu, China equity strategist at Bank of America, agreed that the future did not appear bright for Chinese internet groups in particular. \u201cStocks and sectors once well-owned by foreign investors are suffering higher cost of capital and more derating,\u201d she said.There are now 252 Chinese groups trading in the US or Hong Kong that meet the definition of a \u201cnet-net\u201d \u2014 companies with current assets minus total liabilities greater than their market value, according to S&P Capital IQ. This group includes deeply depressed stocks such as Tencent-backed DouYu, a profitable video game streaming platform with $880mn of net cash and a market cap of just $323mn.\u201cGlobal long-only [investors] have been out for a long time,\u201d one trader at a Chinese brokerage group said of the country\u2019s internet stocks.With the downturn unabating, tech groups have prioritised share repurchases and slimming down. A big Chinese tech investor and director at several leading companies said such strategies were sensible with stock prices so low, adding that he hoped it would help lift share prices so his company could sell long-held positions.The depressed valuations are most problematic for smaller, unprofitable groups such as Bilibili, where employees said management had cut bonuses and laid off staff while also curtailing business lines as they fought to reach break-even.The company\u2019s cratering share price has made the challenge more acute. Investors who lent the group $2.9bn, betting its stock would continue climbing, now have the option and impetus to recall their convertible notes early.Bilibili will by mid-June have spent $1.7bn repurchasing the convertible notes, shrinking its cash pile to about $2bn. It faces another $900mn of debt payments next year, potentially problematic when coupled with its large losses, which totalled almost $900mn over the past 12 months after adjusting for certain non-cash charges. Bilibili declined to comment.\u201cThere is not enough financing to support their cash burn,\u201d said a person close to the company, noting management \u201clacked imagination on how to grow\u201d.Even China\u2019s biggest tech companies are taking drastic action. Alibaba has spent the equivalent of about half of its free cash flow repurchasing shares over the past year and cut 24,000 positions. Employees widely expect the group\u2019s continuing split into six entities will entail further job losses.Staff said they were being hit doubly hard by the declining value of stock compensation, which for some made up half of their pay, and increasing workloads.A developer at Tencent said the pay was no longer worth the pressure. \u201cEveryone is doing three people\u2019s work,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of cash now so they want to lower costs and raise efficiency. The golden time for internet companies is gone.\u201dAdditional reporting by Andy Lin in Hong Kong",

The verification method will first be tested on the Airport Express Line in Beijing, China before expanding to other locations and settings including offices, retail outlets, college campuses, and restaurants.Users simply need to hold their hands over designated scanners, currently situated at select metro station turnstiles, and an automatic payment is made. The technology which is developed by the AI lab YouTu, scans both the surface-level palm prints as well as hand veins to make a read.For now, eligible users include residents in mainland China who have completed the real name verification process for WeChat Pay.

China was hit particularly hard, experiencing a lengthy hiatus on new game licences and grappling with new restrictions on playtime in an attempt by the government to curb \"youth game addiction\". This saw operating revenue shrink in every one of the country\u2019s top ten game developers in Q1, with the exception of Tencent and NetEase.Additionally, seven of China\u2019s top ten mobile games in Q1 were published by NetEase or Tencent, showcasing the powerful position each company has in the world\u2019s biggest mobile gaming market.Market DominanceTencent accounted for roughly 50% of domestic market revenue for the quarter, compared to 40% in Q1 2022. The company\u2019s operating revenue rose 11% to 48.3 billion yuan ($6.8 billion), while domestic revenue rose 6.4% to 35.1 billion yuan ($4.93 billion). Overseas revenue rose by a record 25%, hitting 13.2 billion yuan ($1.86 billion).NetEase, meanwhile, saw a 7.6% year-on-year increase in operating revenue from games, reaching 20.1 billion yuan ($2.86 billion). Gaming represented 80% of the company\u2019s total revenue, highlighting the mobile gaming market\u2019s resilience in the face of turbulence in the market.However, Yicai Global notes that the release of more licences could see this current dominance challenged, offering more opportunities for local game makers to increase their market share by releasing new titles. Notably, the recent launch of MiHoYo\u2019s Honkai: Star Rail broke records with 20 million downloads in its first two days, with the Financial TImes stating that the company is aiming to challenge Tencent for the crown of China\u2019s gaming market.We listed NetEase, Tencent, and MiHoYo as three of the top 50 mobile game makers of 2022.",

These projects stood out for their innovative use of AI, data and assistive technologies to maximize the effectiveness of initiatives that make a tangible and positive difference to society.The roadshow of the third Tencent Light Innovation Camp.As we wrap up the event, here are some highlights of innovative projects we saw this year.Guardian Star Project: Transforming Autism Rehabilitation for ChildrenAn estimated 13 million people are diagnosed with autism in China. Early detection and intervention are important to treatment outcomes, and that\u2019s where the Guardian Star Project comes in. The program, led by Dumbo Elephant, aims to improve access for children with the condition to autism rehabilitation and medical diagnostic facilities by leveraging AI technology.The team developed inclusive screening and diagnostic tools that minimize data input errors and provide accurate assessments through standardized questionnaires and scoring methods. AI databases help generate personalized training plans for rehabilitation instructors to use, which in turn lead to improved treatment outcomes for autistic children.A member of the Dumbo Elephant team is presenting the functionality of their application.The project significantly reduces patient assessment costs by over 70 percent, and rehabilitation training costs by over 50 percent, making evaluation and rehabilitation services more affordable for families.Yi Xing: Ensuring Safe Return for Lost Elderly IndividualsIn China, many elderly individuals go missing, with 500,000 reported cases annually. The chances of finding them within four hours are less than 50 percent. Yi Xing, which means \"easy travelling,\" was developed to ensure the safe return of lost elderly individuals with a virtual guiding companion.Designed with accessibility in mind, the app incorporates AI-based intelligent speech recognition and natural language processing (NLP) technology, which supports 36 Chinese dialects and accommodates users with literacy or accent issues. Elderly users can input their home address and contact information, enabling them to navigate their way back home or contact relatives using simple voice commands. The app also features an inherent QR code that can be scanned by others to help them return home when found.A team member explains how AI is applied to their application.The app significantly improves the chances of quickly locating lost individuals, increasing the recovery rate and reducing the risk of danger. It enhances the safety and well-being of lost elderly while providing peace of mind for their families and caregivers.Zhiyue: Safeguarding Ancient TreesA 2004 report on \u201cZibo Ancient and Famous Trees\u201d identified 479 Zibo ancient trees. To help safeguard ancient trees in China, the Zhiyue app was developed to address a lack of comprehensive information about them.Powered by AI technology, the app establishes accurate identities for each registered tree and creates a national map of the trees. Leveraging advanced NLP, it standardizes information and assigns unique IDs to each tree for improved recording and mapping. This enables effective monitoring of trees\u2019 health and proactive measures for their protection to be put in place.Zhiyue can play an important role in conserving biodiversity and preserving the cultural and natural heritage associated with ancient trees.The details of a tree are displayed by Zhiyue, including its age, size, and vigor level.AIGC: Predictive Wildlife ProtectionThe Altai Mountain Nature Protection Team undertook an AI-generated content (AIGC) project focused on monitoring and predicting endangered wildlife habitats in China\u2019s Altai Mountains. The project addresses challenges posed by traditional research methods in these mountainous regions, such as low research efficiency and inaccurate data collection due to prolonged ice and snow coverage.To overcome these challenges, the AIGC project utilizes AI technology to enhance effectiveness in monitoring and predicting wildlife habitat conditions. The team analyzes crucial factors such as weather, hydrology, soil and vegetation to establish rules for identifying suitable habitats and estimating critical thresholds of food availability for endangered species, such as the Mongolian beaver. This proactive approach enables targeted reforestation efforts to reduce conflicts with and harm to wildlife.A member is setting up a device for monitoring the wildlife habitat conditions.In order to support efficient monitoring and prediction, the team has developed a network platform that integrates wildlife image data with continuous observation of habitat factors. They apply AIGC and digital twin technologies to create the platform, which aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of wildlife habitats and enable successful biodiversity conservation efforts.The Power of Light Drives Positive ChangeTencent Light Innovation Camp showcases the transformative power of technology in addressing societal and environmental challenges. By building a bridge between the internet and society, it encourages community organizations to leverage AI, cloud computing and assistive technologies to collaborate and create meaningful impact for humanity and the planet.",

REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration/File Photo/File Photo Acquire Licensing RightsBEIJING/HONG KONG, June 1 (Reuters) - Chinese startup MiniMax, working on AI solutions similar to that of Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT, is close to completing a fundraising of more than $250 million that will value it at about $1.2 billion, people familiar with the matter said.The deal comes amid a global AI buzz kicked off by ChatGPT that has spread to China, shoring up stocks in artificial intelligence firms and prompting a flurry of domestic companies, such as Alibaba (9988.HK), Huawei (HWT.UL), and Baidu (9888.HK), to announce rival products.MiniMax's latest fundraising drew in new investors such as an entity linked to technology giant Tencent, two people said, on condition of anonymity as the information was not public.MiniMax and Tencent (0700.HK) did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.MiniMax was founded in 2021 by some former employees of SenseTime (0020.HK), including Yan Junjie - a former vice president at the Chinese AI firm, two other people said.Its fundraising highlights growing investor interest in what could be China's answer to OpenAI, even as venture capital investment faces pressures in the country amid a teetering economic recovery and U.S. controls on chip exports.Chinese regulators have proposed greater oversight of the emerging popular technology, with some investors and advisers predicting meaningful deal activity in the country's broader AI-generated content sector in the second half of this year.Big tech companies are already pouring massive resources into developing their own AI models, while new startups headed by big-name entrepreneurs like MiniMax are also coming onboard.Wang Huiwen, co-founder of on-demand service giant Meituan (3690.HK), said he has founded a new AI company called Beijing Lightyear Technology with $50 million from investors.Google China's former chief, Kai-Fu Lee, has unveiled his new startup - Project AI 2.0. Wang Xiaochuan, founder of China's No.2 search engine Sogou, said in April that he had founded Baichuan Intelligence with a startup capital of $50 million.MINIMAX'S GLOWWhen starting out, MiniMax received funding from miHoYo, the maker of hit game \"Genshin Impact\", the two other people said, without providing further details.Its other early investors include China's Yunqi Partners and Future Capital, statements from the venture capital funds show.MiHoYo did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.MiniMax's app, Glow, currently allows users to create virtual characters, give them background stories and then chat with them about topics ranging from relationship advice to how to deal with hair loss. MiniMax's AI model can also be used to solve a wide range of tasks.MiniMax's technology has received positive feedback, said Charlie Chai, an analyst with 86Research.\"Kingsoft Cloud Group is working with both MiniMax and Baidu's ERNIE Bot for office productivity use cases. The feedback seems to favour MiniMax,\" Chai said.\"Of course, it was early-stage development, but the remarks were quite surprising to me since I held Baidu in high regard.\"Reporting by Roxanne Liu in Beijing and Josh Ye in Hong Kong; Editing by Himani SarkarOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

Despite macroeconomic challenges, the sector\u2019s growth prospects are promising, thanks to the proliferation of digital technology and the surging demand for digital entertainment.Hence, I think quality entertainment stock Tencent Music Entertainment Group (TME) could be an ideal buy. However, I think it could be wise to wait for a better entry point in Sony Group Corporation (SONY), considering its weak fundamentals.While the entertainment business faced challenges in recent years, there is a growing recognition of the factors influencing the industry\u2019s trajectory. This awareness is empowering entertainment businesses to navigate the changing landscape more effectively and capitalize on emerging opportunities.OTT media services have emerged as a major disruptor, revolutionizing the industry and offering new avenues for content creators and distributors to thrive. The global entertainment and media market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 6.3% to reach $3.36 trillion by 2027.Moreover, streaming media is on the path to becoming fundamental to the entertainment and media landscape currently. Furthermore, reality and live content continue to grow, facilitated by on-demand services and social media platforms.However, with the cost of living continuing to rise, many consumers are trying to cut back on spending. The impact of this reduced spending could result in consumers canceling some subscription services to save money which would impact the entertainment industry.Stock to Buy:Tencent Music Entertainment Group (TME)Based in Shenzhen, China, TME operates online music entertainment platforms to provide music streaming, online karaoke, and live streaming services in the People\u2019s Republic of China.Its trailing-12-month EBIT margin of 14.27% is 69.3% higher than the 8.43% industry average. Its trailing-12-month net income margin of 14.69% is 422.6% higher than the 2.81% industry average.TME\u2019s total revenue increased 5.4% year-over-year to RMB2.60 billion ($368 million) in the fiscal first quarter, which ended March 31, 2023.

Given his previous roles in survival-themed films like Men In Black, I Am Legend, and I, Robot, his inclusion in Undawn seems fitting and captivating for players.The developing studio officially confirmed the \u2018Men in Black\u2019 star\u2019s involvement in Undawn through a YouTube video, showcasing his character and brief interactions within the immersive open-world environment created by Lightspeed Studios.The revealing video begins with Smith's character gearing up to defend himself against a swarm of enemies, skillfully dispatching them with an AR (Assault Rifle) and showcasing impressive combat moves. The attention to detail in his character model design is evident through a zoomed-in shot, highlighting the level of craftsmanship involved.The Undawn x Will Smith trailer concludes with a shot reminiscent of Smith's character Robert Neville walking through an abandoned city street in I Am Legend, offering players a glimpse of the expansive open world.The revealing video also showcases pre-registrations for the game, rewarding players with in-game currency, useful equipment, and items.While the trailer does not explicitly reveal the extent of the Hollywood icon\u2019s role in the game, it remains uncertain if he will be a playable hero or an NPC that players can engage with for quests and objectives.With over two million players already signed up for Undawn, the inclusion of the \u2018Aladin\u2019 actor as the star of the game is expected to attract even more players upon its release.ALSO READ| Assassin's Creed Mirage gameplay trailer unveils a return to the franchise's rootsThis new project not only adds to Smith's impressive list of credits but also demonstrates his willingness to explore new creative avenues beyond traditional film roles.

In December 2015, OtherSide Entertainment acquired the rights to develop System Shock 3 from Nightdive Studios, but in May 2020, OtherSide released a statement that multinational corporation Tencent had taken over the development. In March 2022, OtherSide co-founder Warren Spector (who also created the original System Shock) clarified that OtherSide had ceased developing System Shock 3 at all after 2019, and the project belongs exclusively to Tencent now.Nightdive CEO Stephen Kick has reiterated that the rights to System Shock 3 (and potentially additional sequels) belong to Tencent, but Tencent has not commented on the project\u2019s development since acquiring it. If Tencent has a studio developing the game, it has not made that information public.When OtherSide was developing the game, it received a non-gameplay teaser trailer in March 2019, and in September 2019, it received a pre-alpha gameplay trailer. The latter looked pretty good and suggested the game would take place at a TriOptimum Blacksite. It is unclear if Tencent is retaining anything that OtherSide developed though \u2014 and it is also unclear if System Shock 3 is even currently in active development.So, the answer to if System Shock 3 is still happening is \u2014 possibly, but Tencent has not acknowledged its development publicly, which is deeply concerning.",

Tencent on Wednesday attributed its 11 percent revenue climb in part to a rebound in digital payments as Chinese consumers began to spend money again after a long dry spell.

Recognition of a unique palm print triggers an automatic payment through the user's WeChat account.To register, palm prints must be taken at a designated machine at a metro station. Passengers can then use their palms at turnstiles with a green circle, Tencent said in a statement on Monday.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.The technology relies on recognition of both surface-level palm prints and the hand's veins, according to Tencent. It was developed by the company's YouTu artificial intelligence lab.\"In our aim to improve efficiency and greatly simplify user experience, we are making new technology more user-friendly for the elderly and accessible to people with disabilities,\" the company said in the statement.Tencent said it is gradually rolling out palm payments for use in other settings including offices, campuses, retail outlets and restaurants.The new payment method drew heated discussions on social media, as many netizens have grown increasingly privacy-conscious in a country where biometric data theft is a common occurrence and facial recognition payments have been available for years.\"Is it really safe to collect biometric data?\" asked one user on the microblogging platform Weibo in one of the more popular comments on the topic.Some people said they expect it to be more convenient than current payment methods. \"It's quite useful when my phone runs out of battery and I can still pay with my hand,\" another user commented.Story continuesThe service is currently only available to residents in mainland China who have completed real name verification, a requirement for WeChat Pay.Other big tech companies have also been working on palm payments. Alibaba Group Holding, China's largest e-commerce firm and owner of the South China Morning Post, is working on similar technology for its competing Alipay service, a patent filing shows, as reported by media outlet Tech Planet in February.WeChat Pay and Alipay together account for more than 90 per cent of the mobile payments market in mainland China.In the US, e-commerce giant Amazon.com launched its own hand-scan technology called Amazon One in offline stores in 2020, later expanding it to various locations of its grocery chain Whole Foods.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

But the tech giant has bigger ambitions \u2014 it is gradually rolling out palm payments at offices, campuses, retail outlets, and restaurants.The Jing Take: The release of the automatic palm payment has generated excitement online. Netizens have been actively discussing the pros and cons of the new transaction method on China\u2019s microblogging platform Weibo. Thus far, the hashtag #WeChatpalmpaymentrelease has garnered 7.15 million views, and is topping Weibo\u2019s Hot Search List.However, some are skeptical about the new payment method. Weibo user @liuguangruoshi asks: \u201cAren\u2019t face scanning, fingerprint, and digital passwords not enough? Why do we want to use palms now?\u201dSome tech bloggers, such as @techfuit, have said that palm prints are more private than other biometric identifications and faster, but warn that improved convenience may hurt consumers\u2019 wallets. \u200b\u200bAccording to Tencent, the system involves the collection, processing, and storing of information on users\u2019 palms and veins. It says it will delete the original samples and pictures of users\u2019 palms once the required information has been extracted. Consumers\u2019 willingness to divulge more personal information is yet to be seen.Arch WeChat Pay rival Alibaba Alipay is also working on palm payments, media outlet Tech Planet reports. As the two combined account for more than 90 percent of Mainland China\u2019s mobile payments market, palm payments are likely to become a transaction fixture.The palm print payment method can be linked with fitness memberships, cinema tickets, travel cards, and more. In light of this, luxury brands targeting young consumers in China should keep palm payments on their radar as the service expands.For maisons, palm print tech could enable boutiques to more easily identify clients, their worldwide transaction record, VIC status, and preferences, hence better positioning businesses to provide hyper-personalized shopping experiences. Additionally, the tech reduces the risk of abandoned transactions because a potential consumer forgot their wallet or phone, or their device has run out of power.Keeping it old-school won\u2019t work with the younger generations of shoppers. Even for high-ticket items, speedier, more convenient transaction processes will likely prevail over traditional payment methods.The Jing Take reports on a piece of the leading news and presents our editorial team\u2019s analysis of the key implications for the luxury industry.

It owns WeChat (also known as Weixin), the leading \"super app\" in China, which bundles together mobile messages, social networking tools, digital payments, online purchases, integrated games, and other features in a walled garden.Tencent owns China's third-largest cloud infrastructure platform, after Alibaba Cloud and Huawei Cloud, as well as WeChat Pay -- which holds a near-duopoly in China's digital payments market with Ant Group's AliPay. It also owns the streaming video platform Tencent Video and the streaming music leader Tencent Music (TME).But over the past five years, Tencent's stock declined nearly 20%. The tech leader lost its luster as China's regulators cracked down on the video game sector while closely scrutinizing the company's past and planned acquisitions. The pandemic, China's subsequent lockdowns, and the macro headwinds all exacerbated that slowdown.Should investors buy Tencent now and expect it to recover over the next five years? Or will it remain a lackluster investment as its core businesses mature?What happened to Tencent over the past five years?Between 2017 and 2022, Tencent's annual revenue had a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18% as its adjusted net income rose at a CAGR of 12%. Those growth rates look stable, but a closer look reveals a troubling slowdown.Metric 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Revenue growth 56% 32% 21% 28% 16% (1%) Adjusted net income growth 43% 19% 22% 30% 1% (7%)Tencent's growth decelerated over the past two years for three main reasons.First, China's regulators tightened their video game playtime restrictions for minors and throttled their approvals for new video games. China froze all of its new video game approvals in August 2021 while slowly resuming that process last April, but didn't actually approve any of Tencent's games until last December.Second, Tencent's advertising business -- which serves up ads across WeChat, its older social networking platform QQ, its media platforms, and its other websites and apps -- faced intense macro and competitive headwinds. On the macro front, China's intermittent COVID lockdowns curbed the market's appetite for new ads. Government crackdowns across the gaming, e-commerce, and online education markets also caused its ad sales to those verticals to slow to a crawl.As for the competition, Tencent's advertising platforms struggled to stay ahead of Gen Z targeted platforms like ByteDance's Duoyin (known as TikTok overseas) and Bilibili.Lastly, Tencent's expansion of its \"fintech and business services\" through WeChat Pay and Tencent Cloud -- which was intended to diversify its business away from games and ads -- ran into regulatory, competitive, and macro challenges.WeChat Pay struggled with slower consumer spending and tighter restrictions on digital payments. Tencent Cloud struggled as the macro headwinds forced companies to rein in their spending on big cloud upgrades. Intense competition from Alibaba, Huawei, and others also forced Tencent Cloud to slash its prices and abandon some of its loss-leading strategies.What will happen over the next five years?The past few years were tough for Tencent, but the next five years might be better. China's regulators are now consistently approving Tencent's new games again, and it continues to diversify its gaming business away from China with overseas hits like Valorant, League of Legends, Triple Match 3D, Goddess of Victory: Nikke, and Warhammer 40,000: Darktide.Tencent's advertising business still faces a lot of competition, but WeChat will remain China's dominant super app for the foreseeable future, with its 1.32 billion monthly active users. Tencent Video and Tencent Music should also continue to dominate their respective markets.Therefore, Tencent's total ad revenue should rise as China's economy experiences its post-COVID recovery. That rising tide should also boost consumer spending on WeChat Pay and bring more businesses back to Tencent Cloud. As those headwinds dissipate, analysts expect Tencent's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 12% between 2022 and 2025. However, they only expect its net income to increase at a CAGR of less than 1% as it ramps up its investments in new games, ads, and services.If Tencent hits those targets and grows its revenue at a CAGR of 10% from 2025 to 2028, it might generate 1.03 trillion yuan ($150 billion) in revenue by the final year -- which would be nearly double its 555 billion yuan in revenue in 2022.We should take those long-term estimates with a grain of salt, since China's post-COVID recovery remains fragile and the competitive and regulatory challenges are unpredictable. But assuming Tencent still trades at roughly 4 times sales in 2028, its stock could potentially double over the next five years -- so it might be a good time to revisit this Chinese stock.",

            "description": "HYBE, the South Korea-based entertainment company behind BTS, has entered into a music distribution partnership with Tencent Music Entertainment (TME), a major player in the Chinese music streaming industry.The partnership was reported by Seoul Economic Daily on Tuesday (May 23), a week after TME revealed in its first-quarter results that it established a \u201cstrategic collaboration\u201d with HYBE. The news was also reported by Reuters.The deal will see the catalog of HYBE artists including Seventeen and Tomorrow x Together available on Chinese streaming platforms QQ Music, Kugou and Kuwo.The deal comes at a time when TME continues to grow its paying user base. In the first quarter, TME\u2019s paying users reached 94.4 million, up 17.7% from a year ago.In addition to existing music, the agreement between HYBE and TME also covers upcoming songs by HYBE artists. The specific terms of the contract were not disclosed by a HYBE official who confirmed to Seoul Economic Daily the signing of the agreement earlier this month.This collaboration is significant for HYBE as it enables the company to accurately track sales and profits in the Chinese market. Without an official distribution contract, HYBE artists were unable to fully collect revenues from China, resulting in only 1% of HYBE\u2019s overall sales in 2022 coming from the country, according to the report from Seoul Economic Daily.In contrast, Japan accounted for 32.7% of HYBE\u2019s sales in Asia, excluding Korea, in the first quarter.The agreement will also allow HYBE to capitalize on the growing music market in China. In 2021, sales of Chinese record producers reached $1.06 billion, topping that of their South Korean counterparts, according to the Korean news outlet.TME\u2019s revenue from online music services in Q1 surged 33.8% YoY to 3.5 billion yuan (approx. USD $496 million).Meanwhile, HYBE\u2019s revenue jumped 44.1% YoY in Q1 to 410.6 billion South Korea won ($311 million), driven by strong album sales, which in turn was boosted by solo releases from BTS members Jimin and Suga, as well as robust album sales from Tomorrow x Together and Seventeen.HYBE rival SM Entertainment has already been making strides in the Chinese market. In 2019, it signed a similar agreement with TME. That deal allowed SM artists such as SUPER JUNIOR, Girls\u2019 Generation, SHINee, EXO, Red Velvet, KANGTA, BoA, TVXQ!, NCT and aespa to distribute their music on TME\u2019s platforms in China.Nearly a year ago, SM also struck a licensing deal with Chinese tech giant NetEase\u2018s subsidiary Cloud Village, which operates music streaming service NetEase Cloud Music. The agreement allowed Cloud Music to distribute SM\u2019s music catalog in China.The agreement with TME could also complement HYBE\u2019s artificial intelligence moves as HYBE recently released a track with AI-powered vocals in six languages, which the agency says is the \u201cfirst-ever multilingual track produced in Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese, Spanish and Vietnamese.\u201dTME has also been actively involved in producing songs using AI. Back in November, TME made waves by announcing the creation and release of over 1,000 tracks featuring vocals generated by AI, closely emulating the nuances of the human voice.One of these AI-generated tracks has already surpassed 100 million streams, TME said at the time.Music Business Worldwide",

            "description": "In this article BIDUBABABABA700-HK Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNTChinese tech giants Tencent and Alibaba touted artificial intelligence as a transformative technology on company earnings calls this week. Costfoto | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesChina's technology giants are banking on artificial intelligence to bolster their businesses, touting new features for their existing services as well as novel generative AI tools, as hype around the technology reaches dizzying heights. Alibaba , Tencent and Baidu , collectively known as \"BAT,\" all sung the praises of generative AI \u2014 a subset of artificial intelligence that deals in tools that can dream up text, images and other content in response to user prompts \u2014 on company earnings calls this month. Styled on ChatGPT, the popular Microsoft-backed AI chatbot that has become renowned for its ability to hold more humanlike conversations, such systems have attracted huge interest from investors and a heated race among companies seeking to incorporate the technology or develop their own alternatives. In the Chinese companies' case, generative AI tools are expected to be more restrictive in terms of what users can or can't say due to Beijing's tight grip on internet services in the country. But the Chinese government hasn't opted to kill ChatGPT-like products, though ChatGPT itself remains inaccessible in the country. Instead, Beijing introduced new rules to manage how companies develop such tools. China's tech giants have made no delay in using that more open attitude to new technological innovations \u2014 a stark contrast with its approach to cryptocurrencies \u2014 to their advantage.China's tech giants last week outlined their belief that they see generative AI as a technological revolution. \"Generative AI represents a tremendous opportunity for us. It can be compared to the introduction of the internet and smartphones,\" Robin Li, Baidu's CEO, said on the company's first-quarter earnings call.watch now\"To capture this opportunity, we leveraged our technology capabilities and our extensive experience in search, knowledge graph, and dialogue,\" he added. Baidu said it was awaiting regulatory approval for its Ernie Bot chatbot service, a rival to OpenAI's ChatGPT. On Wednesday, Tencent confirmed the existence of a so-called foundation model it is working on, called HunyuanAide. Foundation models are large AI programs trained on vast amounts of data so that they can be adapted to solve a wide range of tasks. Meanwhile, Tencent President Martin Lau said the firm is \"making good progress\" with the technology. \"I think one key strength for us is obviously the use cases,\" Lau said on the firm's first-quarter earnings call. \"We have different products [and] teams already planning some interesting offerings alongside \u2026 their products.\" Alibaba, which developed its own ChatGPT-style generative AI tool Tongyi Qianwen earlier this year, said its system could help accelerate customer adoption of its cloud computing service. So far, Alibaba has seen ample demand for Tongyi Qianwen, with 200,000 enterprise customers applying for trial access. \"The development of AI technology presents a huge new opportunity for the cloud business because artificial intelligence applications will result in an exponential increase in demand for computing power,\" Daniel Zhang, the company's CEO, said on its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call. \"This kind of computing power needs to be provided as a kind of public service or infrastructure. So, this is a huge opportunity for us going forward.\" Zhang's commentary came as Alibaba announced plans to spin off its cloud computing unit as a separately listed entity. The tech giants' ambitions on AI reflect an escalating global arms race that is now underway as countries seek to gain leadership over the technology. Microsoft and Google , two of the largest technology companies, currently dominate the conversation surrounding AI with their respective advanced language processing technologies.watch nowDan Ives, managing director of equities at Wedbush Securities, told CNBC that generative AI is seen as a \"paradigm shift\" in the tech industry. China, specifically, \"has some of the most advanced AI tech in the world,\" he added. \"We believe this is a Game of Thrones also playing out in the China Tech market as the gloves are on for this battle,\" Ives said. \"The Big Tech stalwarts such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu among others are trying to put an iron fence around its installed base on AI. Many innovative vendors are going after this market and China tech is now in the midst of a secular shift around AI.\" The comments from some of China's top tech companies last week hint at how Beijing is seeking to ramp up its rivalry with the U.S. on AI. There have been concerns, however, that a U.S. ban on Chinese companies from buying advanced chips and chipmaking equipment may stunt China's AI progress. Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent don't produce their own chips, instead relying on chipmakers like Nvidia to get the processors needed for their cloud computing operations. This makes them vulnerable to sanctions from the U.S. Over the weekend, China banned its domestic companies from purchasing equipment from U.S. chipmaker Micron in retaliation to the U.S. sanctions. \"I think, going forward, obviously AI requires a lot of computing power so, as a result, it's hard to see how China can manage to win this competition if it just keeps having this crucial technology being banned to its AI industry,\" Hao Hong, chief economist of Grow Investment Group, told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" Monday. For its part, Tencent said chips are still \"largely available\" for the time being and that there are \"some workarounds\" that enable it to continue maintaining access to graphics processing units in China. These GPUs are used to power AI applications.A.I. with limitsOne thing that was clear from the Chinese tech giants' earnings statements and calls last week was that they're aware of \u2014 and keen to comply with \u2014 an impending regulatory tightening on AI.\"We felt the government's general stance is supportive of regulation \u2014 but the industry has to be regulated,\" said Tencent's Lau. \"And I think this is not something that's specific to China \u2026 If you look at the U.S., there's a lot of public discussion about having regulation.\" Baidu's Li said the company \"put a lot of effort into both technology and compliance development to ensure our products and services meet applicable regulatory requirements.\" \"For important and sensitive topics, we have to make sure AI will not hallucinate. Given that LLM is more or less a probabilistic model, this task is not trivial at all,\" he added. LLMs are large language models, meaning advanced AI algorithms trained on huge sets of data to process, understand and produce human language. \"The requirements are not final yet, so we have to continue to update our strategy as it evolves.\" It comes on the heels of a harsh crackdown from China on its domestic tech businesses which has only begun to subside after wiping $1 trillion off the combined industry's market value. China had taken strict measures against some of its most valuable tech firms, from Alibaba and Tencent, to Didi and Meituan, in moves that were interpreted as keeping the companies in line and preventing them from abusing their market power.

            "description": "Investors were focused on whether the reopening of China's economy will give a boost to the country's tech giants, including Tencent. China's economy grew 4.5% in the first quarter, the fastest pace in a year.Net profit \"increased at a faster pace, reflecting a positive revenue mix shift, operational efficiencies, and an easy base period,\" Tencent said in the report Wednesday.The results mark a strong bounce back to growth for Tencent after a succession of negative and flat quarters. The company said in its earnings that it benefited from a solid recovery in domestic consumption in China, which finally began easing its aggressive Covid-19 restrictions in December.Tencent reported results after the market close in Hong Kong Wednesday. Shares of Prosus, a major Tencent shareholder in Europe, were barely changed.Here's how Tencent did in the first quarter, versus Refinitiv consensus estimates:Tencent reported an 11% jump in quarterly revenue Wednesday, marking its fastest growth in more than a year, as the company saw a big rebound in payment volumes, ad sales, and gaming.The company's popular locally released Honor of Kings game saw record-high gross receipts in the quarter, Tencent said. The firm saw increased revenues from other established titles including DnF and CrossFire Mobile, as well as recently launched game Arena Breakout.Tencent said its gaming business benefited from a return to growth in domestic game sales.The Chinese tech industry as a whole faced intense scrutiny as part of a broader regulatory tightening by Beijing that began in late 2020 and wiped off more than a combined $1 trillion from the country's biggest companies.Tencent, which is a major owner of and investor in tech businesses worldwide, has been shedding some of its equity investments as Beijing remains on high alert about the size of domestic tech companies.But more recently, there have been signs the central government is softening its stance toward internet titans like Tencent, Alibaba, and Didi.In 2021, Chinese regulators froze the approval of new video game releases, which badly impacted Tencent. However, over the past few months, Beijing has loosened its grip on the industry greenlighting more titles for release.Tencent said Wednesday that limitations on when kids can play games had a big impact on the contribution of minors to its overall gaming revenue. Minors contributed 0.4% of total time spent and 0.7% of total gross receipts for domestic games in the quarter, down 96% and 90% respective year-over-year.Amid a tougher gaming market at home, Tencent has boosted its focus on international markets. Tencent said the international gaming business saw strong growth, with its battle royale title Valorant seeing year-on-year gross receipts growth of 30%.PUBG Mobile, another popular battle royale title, resumed sequential growth in daily active users, Tencent said.The bulk of Tencent's overall revenues came from its value-added services, which refers to virtual goods including video games. This segment accounted for 57% of the company's total sales.Of that segment, international gaming was the biggest driver, Tencent said, with overseas game sales growing 25% year-over-year to 13.2 billion yuan.Domestic game sales, by contrast, grew by 6% year-on-year to 35.1 billion yuan.Social network revenues, which includes Tencent's WeChat and QQ instant messaging apps, increased by 6% to 31 billion yuan driven by in-game virtual item sales and the company's music subscription service.Fintech and business services, which includes Tencent's WeChat Pay payments service, accounted for 32% of revenue. Revenues in that segment grew 14% year-on-year to 48.7 billion yuan, an acceleration from the fourth quarter of 2022, thanks to recovery in commercial payment volumes due to a rebound in China consumption, Tencent said.Business services growth was primarily driven by a jump in sales in Tencent's cloud services division, which has become an greater focus for the company lately.",

Chief Financial Officer John Lo will conclude with a financial discussion before we open the floor for questions. Now, I will pass it to Pony.Pony Ma -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Wendy. Good evening. Thank you for joining us. During the first quarter, we resumed a double-digit revenue growth rate as our payment volumes benefited from and facilitated domestic consumption recovery.Our games revenue improved and our advertising revenue sustained rapid growth. Our non-IFRS net profit increased at a faster pace, reflecting a positive revenue mix shift, operational efficiency, and an easy base period. We are investing in our AI capabilities and cloud infrastructure to embrace the opportunities brought by foundation models and expect AI to be a growth multiplier that enables us to better serve our users, customers, and society at large. Now, let me go through the headline financial numbers for the quarter.Total revenue was 150 billion RMB, up 11% year on year and 3% quarter and quarter. Gross profit was 68 billion RMB, up 19% year on year and 10% quarter on quarter. Non-IFRS operating profit was 48 billion RMB, up 32% year on year and 23% quarter on quarter. Non-IFRS net profit attributable to equity holders was 33 billion RMB, up 27% year on year and 10% quarter on quarter.With our key services, we focused on upgrading our technologies and product innovations. Our franchise in communications and social networks remained strong. Combined MAU of Weixin and WeChat grew 2% year on year to 1.3 billion, while QQ mobile devices MAU grew 6% year on year to 597 million. For games, we expand our leadership via extending popularity of established franchise and success of new released in China and international markets.For digital content, we retained our first-place position by subscription account with high-quality content across video, music, and literature. In fintech services, commercial payment volume rebounded sharply as consumption activities recovered in China. For cloud, we operate one of China's largest infrastructure as a service platforms and announced our high-performance computing cluster in April, which will significantly enhance the efficiency of our foundation model chain. We are the second biggest provider of PaaS in China by revenue, and we operate leading SaaS tools such as Tencent Meeting, the most widely used stand-alone video conferencing app.I will now hand over to Martin and James for business review.Martin Lau -- PresidentThank you, Pony. Good evening and good morning to everybody. For the first quarter of 2023, our total revenue was up 11% year on year. VAS represented 53% of our total revenue.Within which, social networks subsegment was 21%, domestic games subsegment was 23%, and international games was 9%. Online advertising was 14% of total revenue, and fintech and business services was 32% of total revenue. For our value-added services segment, the revenue was 79 billion RMB, up 9% year on year. Social networks revenue was up 6% year on year to 31 billion RMB, reflecting growth of in-game item sales and music subscription revenue.Our long-form video subscription revenue decreased 6% year on year due to delayed content releases during the first quarter. However, we have taken steps to address this situation, including, number one, enhancing our content to cater to evolving user demands. For example, we released our self-commissioned drama series, The Long Season, in April, which became the highest-rated domestic drama series in the past five years per the Douban review aggregation site. And number two, extending our collaboration with short-form video services, which would help long-form content reach more users and capture more monetization opportunities.Music subscription revenue increased 30% year on year, driven by growth in paying users and ARPU. We upgraded the listening experience and strengthened cooperation with labels and artists, which resulted in higher user engagement and paying propensity. Domestic games revenue resumed growth to 6% year on year and reached 35 billion RMB on top of solid performance from key titles such as Honour of Kings, DnF, and CrossFire Mobile. New game Arena Breakout, which we released in third quarter last year, also contributed notably to the growth.International games revenue increased by 25% year on year or 18% in constant currency terms to 13 billion RMB. The robust performance of Valorant, as well as contributions from 2022 releases Nikke and Triple Match 3D, drove up revenue. For communications and social networks, Weixin video accounts consumption continued to grow with rapid increases in time spent and video views. In order to drive its continued organic growth, we are nurturing a healthy and active creator community.First, in order to attract more creators and help them reach their target audience more efficiently, we have upgraded our onboarding programs with greater traffic incentives, wider creator coverage, and more effective content creation tools. Second, we have enhanced the e-commerce infrastructure, enabling creators to be benefiting from sales commissions associated with e-commerce transactions. For example, we enriched the customer management functionalities in video accounts shop, facilitating creators to better engage with customers and increase sales conversion. As a result, our creator community is increasingly vibrant.The first quarter daily active creators and daily video uploads more than doubled year on year, while the number of creators with over 10,000 followers more than tripled year on year. On QQ, we deployed a new architecture to optimize development efficiency across operating systems on a unified code base. This new technology foundation also enhances user security with strengthened data encryption mechanisms and improved users' graphical experience with more advanced rendering solutions. We believe this upgrade will enable faster innovation in QQ's user experience going forward.Moving on to domestic games. Before discussing product and financial trends, I want to highlight that as a result of our continued and dedicated minor protection program, users aged under 18 contributed less than 1% of total time spent and gross receipts in the quarter. Time spent and gross receipts from users aged under 18 reduced by 96% and 90% from three years ago, respectively. We continue to take our societal responsibility with regard to games content and minor protection very seriously.Looking into the performance of our most popular games. Honour of Kings launched highly appealing ShanHaiJing-themed outfits with targeted marketing programs during the Chinese New Year season, contributing to record-high quarterly gross receipts. CrossFire, a PC game we have operated since 2008, successfully attracted returning players with promotions targeting internet cafes. CrossFire Mobile, which was launched in 2015, released a popular themed map outfit and weapon items based on the virtual idol group created for the game.Both CrossFire and CrossFire Mobile achieved record-high gross receipts in the quarter. Additionally, new games we launched recently in high-potential genres have generated strong traction. The Fight of the Golden Spatula, which has stayed as the No. 1 auto-battler game since launch in 2021, increased its gross receipts by more than 30% year on year in the quarter.We recently launched a fast-paced game mode that appeals to returning and new players, driving average DAU to a record high of over 10 million in April 2023. With Arena Breakout, the most popular extraction shooter game in China, we have been nurturing a highly engaged user base since launch in July 2022 and stepped up marketing activities during the Chinese New Year. In the first quarter, the title grew and achieved new milestones in DAU and gross receipts. We launched Metal Slug: Awakening in April, moving a classic arcade game IP to a mobile and multiplayer experience.Metal Slug ranked No. 1 among new action games released year to date. Now, with that, I'll pass on to James.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerThank you, Martin, and good morning or afternoon or evening, everyone. For international games, we increased gross receipts by a double-digit percentage year on year, with strengthened performance from key titles. Valorant grew its MAU year on year on a new map and a new agent and drove up its gross receipts by over 30% year on year, with popular Japan-themed and alien-themed weapon items in the quarter. PUBG Mobile resumed sequential daily active user growth in the quarter after several quarters of decline, benefiting from new combat features and enhanced player-versus-player gameplay.We introduced a map editing tool to facilitate user-generated content, enhancing user engagement and longevity. Our subsidiary Miniclip launched Triple Match 3D in April last year, which has become a breakout success in the highly competitive match game genre, leveraging creative gameplay and effective user acquisition. Triple Match 3D is the only title released within the last two years which has broken into the top 10 games in the match genre, driving Miniclip's gross receipts to a record high in the quarter. Turning to online advertising.Revenue was 21 billion RMB in the first quarter, up 17% year on year. As a reminder, during the same period last year, our revenue included a several percentage-point contribution from the Beijing Winter Olympics. The rapid year-on-year revenue growth was supported by the new revenue stream for video accounts ads, solid demand for mini program ads, and the continued recovery of our mobile ad network. Sequentially, revenue declined 15% due to adverse seasonality.Ad spend grew year on year across most categories, benefiting from the consumption recovery in China. For example, fast-moving consumer goods advertisers increased spending to capture retail sales growth, travel advertisers increased spending due to rebounding offline activities, and large e-commerce platforms increasingly recognize us as a key user acquisition channel, boosted their spending with us accordingly. We upgraded our machine learning advertising platform to deliver higher conversions for advertisers. For example, we helped our advertisers dynamically feature their most relevant products inside their advertisements by applying our deep learning model to the standard product unit attributes we have aggregated within our SPU database.Advertising on Weixin properties, which contribute over half of our total advertising revenue, outgrew the overall ad business. Video accounts revenue ramped up as we attracted new advertisers and incremental spending from existing advertisers. The average revenue per thousand impressions of video accounts ads sustained at a premium level versus revenue per 1,000 impressions from other short-form video platforms. The content platforms' music ad revenue grew rapidly year on year, driven by the monetization of ad-supported music content, as well as live concert sponsorships.Our long-form video ad revenue declined year on year due to fewer releases of popular content. Our mobile ad network revenue increased robustly year on year. On the supply side, we increased ad inventory and high conversion rate properties such as the smartphone manufacturers' app stores. On the demand side, we attracted higher spending through return on investment-focused advertisers such as the e-commerce platforms.Looking at fintech and business services, segment revenue was 49 billion RMB, up 14% year on year. The fintech services revenue resumed double-digit year-on-year growth, benefiting from the recovery of payments activities. Offline payment transactions rebounded more sharply than online as categories such as retail, travel, and dining services benefited from people going out and about more frequently. Meanwhile, year-on-year revenue growth in wealth management and consumer loans continued at healthy rates.For business services, year-on-year revenue growth turned positive in the first quarter, benefiting from stabilization for our cloud services after a period of extensive restructuring, plus the initial contributions from technology support fees that we've begun generating on the video accounts livestreaming e-commerce transactions. Business services gross margin and gross profit increased notably year on year as we reduce loss-making activities and optimize costs and as we began the livestreaming e-commerce monetization. Within cloud services, our smart transportation solutions are assisting the digitization of large-scale transportation projects. For example, we leveraged our expertise in areas such as cloud infrastructure, digital mapping, and 3D rendering for smart highway projects in Sichuan and metro systems in Guangzhou.And now, I'll pass to John.John Lo -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you, James. Hello, everyone. For the first quarter of 2023, total revenue was 150 billion RMB, up 11% year on year. Gross profit was 68.2 billion RMB, up 8 -- 19% year on year.Net other gains were 0.9 billion RMB, down 93% year on year. Operating profit was 40.4 billion RMB, up 9% year on year. Net finance costs were 2.6 billion RMB, up 37% year on year, due to increased interest expense. Share of profit of associates and joint venture was 0.1 billion RMB, compared to a share of loss of 6.3 billion RMB for the first quarter of 2022.On a non-IFRS basis, share of loss was 0.1 billion RMB, improving from share of loss of 2.2 billion RMB last year. This was driven by improved profitability of certain domestic associates due to their revenue growth and cost control measures. Income tax expenses increased by 118% year on year to 11.5 billion RMB due to pre-tax profit growth, increased withholding tax provision, and a one-time deferred tax adjustment related to an overseas subsidiary. IFRS net profit attributable to equity holders was 25.8 billion RMB, up 10% year on year.Diluted EPS was 2.639 RMB, up 10%. Now, I'll share our non-IFRS financial figures. Operating profit was 48.4 billion RMB, up 32% year on year. Net profit attributable to equity holders was 32.5 billion RMB, up 27% year on year.Diluted EPS was 3.353 RMB, up 28% year on year. Moving on to gross margins. Overall gross margin was 45.5%, up 3.4 percentage points year on year. By segment, gross margin for VAS was 53.9%, up 3.5 percentage points year on year, driven by high-margin games revenue rebound.Gross margin for online advertising was 41.7%, up 5 percentage points year on year, thanks to strong demand for video accounts in-feed ads, leading to higher revenue growth with low incremental [Technical difficulty] Gross margin for fintech and business services was 34.5%, up 2.9 percentage points year on year. This was due to efficiency improvements and initial revenues from technology support fee for livestreaming e-commerce and video accounts. On operating expenses, selling and marketing expenses were 7 billion RMB, representing 4.7% of revenues. This reflects a year-on-year decline of 13%, primarily due to reduced marketing spend.R&D expenses were 15.2 billion RMB, down 1% year on year. G&A expenses, including -- excluding R&D, were 9.4 billion RMB, down 16% year on year. This reflects a reduction in staff costs, including those relating to share-based compensation. At quarter-end, we have approximately 106,000 employees, down 9% year on year or 2% quarter on quarter.Let's look at our operating net margin ratios. For the first quarter of 2023, non-IFRS operating margin was 32.3%, up 5.3 percentage points year on year. Non-IFRS net margin was 22.3%, up 2.9 percentage points year on year. To conclude, I will highlight some key cashflow and balance sheet metrics.Total capex was 4.4 billion RMB, down 37% year on year. Within total capex, operating capex was 1 billion RMB, down 81% year on year, reflecting our efforts to optimize spending and improve utilization of servers and equipment. Nonoperating capex rose by 91% year on year to 3.4 billion RMB due to ongoing construction projects. Free cash flow for the quarter was 51.8 billion RMB, up 240% year on year.The strong growth was driven by higher operating cash flow, thanks to games revenue rebound, as well as decreased payments for capex and media content. Net cash position was 31.5 billion RMB, compared to net debt of 14.8 billion RMB in the previous quarter. The sequential improvement was due to strong free cash flow generation. Thank you.Wendy HuangThank you, John. We shall now open the floor for questions. [Operator instructions] First question comes from Alicia Yap from Citi.Alicia Yap -- Citi -- AnalystHi. Good evening.Wendy HuangAlicia, can you speak up?Alicia Yap -- Citi -- AnalystYeah. Good evening, management. Can you hear me?Wendy HuangWe can't hear you clearly. Maybe you turn up the volume.Alicia Yap -- Citi -- AnalystOK. Hi. Can you hear me better now?Wendy HuangYeah. It's much better now.Alicia Yap -- Citi -- AnalystOK. Thank you. Thanks for giving me the chance to ask questions and congrats on the solid set of results. First question is related to your gaming business.It is delighted to see numbers of the old franchise title regain strong popularity and also achieve a record gross receipt during the quarter. So, based on your observation and what you have seen from your game performance, are there any notable differences in user gameplay behavior or the spending frequency or the willingness pattern that you could highlight that are quite different from what we saw during the pre-pandemic period? Just wondering if, you know, some of these robust game activity that you experienced during the quarter is more attributed to your effective promotional campaign or this is more, you know, the entire industry phenomenon. Second question is on your business services. So, wondering what's management view on the recent price cut action by the major peer and how would that affect Tencent's planned initiative and also industry landscape.Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerYeah. Thank you for the questions, Alicia. So, on the game business, not to be pedantic, but we feel very strongly that what you referred to as old games are, in fact, evergreen games. And if you look at our game portfolio, many of the biggest, most successful titles, including Honour of Kings, League of Legends, CrossFire, CrossFire Mobile, Peacekeeper Elite, PUBG Mobile, Arena Breakout, are competitive games, often team-based competitive games that are designed to be balanced, fair, and playable for years or for decades.And that is the reality that we're seeing across the industry with other similar team-based competitive games. And that is the reality -- you know, what we've really sought to nurture with these big evergreen games. So, in terms of why the games performed well in the first quarter, then we believe it comes down largely to appealing content. We released appealing content.You know, players responded to that appealing content by investing, in some cases, more time and, in other cases, more money or both. And the more money translates into more gross receipts and, therefore, more revenue. In terms of whether there were special promotional campaigns, you know, we always promote the virtual outfits. I think, over time, we've become progressively better at promoting the right virtual outfits at the right time of the calendar year.So, the business has become more akin to luxury goods. And that there are certain virtual outfits we promote to tie into the Lunar New Year. There are others we promote tie into the May Day holidays, into the summer period, and so on and so forth. But that's an ongoing trend as opposed to a single-quarter phenomenon.And then in terms of how user behavior has changed from pre-COVID to today, you know, we don't see a dramatic change. I think it's probably fair to say that in the three years since China went into COVID, despite mixed economic trends, purchasing power has generally increased. The removal of the minor game players skews up the spending power from those who are still playing games who are older. So, therefore, it's natural that there's more ability to spend more on high-quality content now than was the case three years ago.So, that's in terms of the games and particularly the evergreen games. There's many other kinds of games, including content-driven games, and we're seeking to reinforce our position in those other kinds of games. But the big games that we really talked about this quarter were typically these evergreen games. On the business services side and specifically cloud and the impact of price cuts, the impact of these price cuts on Tencent as a whole is not notable.As you know, cloud only represents a mid-single-digit percentage of our total revenue. You know, within that, the price cuts only apply to infrastructure as a service, which is a subset of that mid-single digits. And then even within infrastructure as a service, if you look at the price cuts that have been widely announced in the industry in recent weeks, they apply to long-term prepaid contracts, and those long-term prepaid contracts are generally entered into by small- and medium-sized businesses, but not by larger enterprises. So, you know, this is an industry where, over time, the input costs of servers and bandwidth and so forth are generally falling and it makes sense that the participants in the industry pass on those falling input costs into falling pricing to their customers.But the percentage of our revenue that is impacted by this particular round of price adjustments is in the few basis points range. So, it's not a major moving part for Tencent as a whole. You know, what's more important for us is just continuing to double down on our competitive strengths within cloud and continuing to provide the best possible service to our customers, of which price is one, but not the only facet. Thank you.Alicia Yap -- Citi -- AnalystThank you.Wendy HuangThank you, Alicia. We will take the next question from Alex Yao from J.P. Morgan.Alex Yao -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- AnalystThank you, management, for taking my question and congrats on a strong quarter. I have two questions. Number one is on the balance sheet. The current deferred revenue increased sharply by 18% year on year this quarter.This is a big change compared to the trend in the past several quarters. Can you elaborate the reason and should we expect a strong VAS in the gaming revenue in the next perhaps two to three quarters? And then the second question is around the fintech development. We noticed you guys recently launched an installment loan product to select Weixin payment users. Can you discuss how fast will you roll out the product to the rest of the Weixin paying users and how should we think about the financial impact on your fintech segment? Thank you.John Lo -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah. Firstly, I would like to explain a little bit about what is inside the deferred revenue. Actually, there are a lot of components, you know, including the virtual game items, including business cooperation agreements, prepaid advertising, prepaid [Inaudible] to pay tokens, a lot of different prepaids in there. So, in terms of year-on-year growth, I think it's more due to the fact that, you know, the online games, you know, actually doing very well in terms of the cash consumption.However, you know, well, if you look at, you know, the -- we should look at the total deferred revenue rather than just, you know, the current deferred revenue because, you know, it represents some of the items that might extend, you know, beyond one year. So, if you look at the total deferred revenue, actually, it dropped by 1%. And on year -- quarter-on-quarter basis, it increased by 17% due to reasons that I've mentioned. And I think, you know, for PCA, it's quite natural that, you know, it will drop quarter over quarter because this -- you know, it's amortized according to the original contract.And in terms of, you know, the prepaid advertising, actually, you know, it dropped, you know, partly due to seasonality and partly due to the PCA amortization that I've just mentioned. So, if you look at the deferred revenue, I suggest we should add the two up to arrive at, you know, the actual, you know, deferred revenue for the whole company.Martin Lau -- PresidentIn terms of the installment loan product, that's actually tied to consumption. So, this is more like a if somebody buys an item of high value, then it actually allows the user to select to pay for the item on an installment basis. And this is a product which we're pilot testing right now, and we're not in a hurry to roll it out on a broad basis. And this is a product which is designed alongside with some principles which we design our fintech products.Number one, it's actually sort of in due compliance of the regulatory authority's regulation. And number two, this is something which our users want. So, it is designed with a very key focus on generating user value because the users, when they want to buy an item and it's a clear consumption need and if they have the creditworthiness, then we are in a good position to give them an installment loan. And in some cases, the merchants, actually, want to see that happen as well.And then in terms of risk management, we're actually very focused on risk management in these products, and that's why we are pilot testing it and want to understand all the credit performance first before we roll it out on a gradual basis. And over time, we would want to work with licensed financial institutions in terms of expanding this product. So, overall, I think this is consistent with our gradual expansion of our range of financial value-added services to our users, as well as to merchants, that are using our payment platform. But at the same time, we have a very strong focus on the factors that I talked about, as well as self-restraint in terms of the overall scale growth, because we felt this is actually the ultimate risk control mechanism.Now, if we grow this product on a gradual basis, while at the same time, we accumulate a lot of experience and know-how, then the risk management will be done at a high-quality way. And this is how we want to manage our financial products going forward.Wendy HuangThank you, Alex. We will take the next question from Ronald Keung from Goldman Sachs.Ronald Keung -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystThank you. Hi. Thank you, Pony, Martin, James, John, and Wendy. I guess our first question maybe on the macro and the advertising side that how was our view on the consumption outlook from here now that we've passed the two quarters of reopening thus far? If we look at the ad revenue and video accounts kind of contribution adding, should we think of a kind of two-year CAGR growth rate, should we see further improvement in the rest of 2023 as e-commerce and other parts of the business ramp up? And then a second question is, just want to hear how we think about the foundation model AI landscape.If you could share some of where Tencent sees to be and to see kind of where will kind of we see this foundation model mostly be of commercial value to our business, knowing the different regulations, any kind of different players trying to come in, and the availability of infrastructure and chips, how do we see this business driving our future multiple growth drivers and the cloud growth into the second half and next year? Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerSo, Ronald, on the advertising question, you know, we believe China is experiencing a broad-based consumption upturn. You know, the upturn is not uniform across every category, but it's more pronounced for everyday low-ticket priced items, more patchy for high-ticket priced items. Now, in terms of how that translates into our advertising revenue, we're experiencing strength basically across the board. So, fast-moving consumer goods, e-commerce, finance, online services, healthcare, travel, are all behaving robustly.On the weaker side, there are no categories that are notably weak at this point in time. And there are categories such as automobiles or electronic products where the end demand is erratic, but what we can see is that companies in those categories are still very keen to drive sales. And one of the ways they do that is by advertising on our platform. On your question about the two-year CAGR, I believe that in the first quarter, the two-year CAGR for our advertising revenue was minus 2%.So, while we don't give guidance, I think the answer to your question logically should be in the affirmative. As a reminder, in the course of 2021, we began that year with -- you know, our biggest advertiser category was education-related spending, which dropped very sharply during the course of the year. We also lost several important advertising formats such as the full-screen ads in our ad network during the course of the year. So, the two-year comparison does get notably easier for the industry and for us as we move forward over the coming months.So, I hope that's helpful on the advertising side.Martin Lau -- PresidentOn the AI and foundation model side, I think you actually asked a lot of questions, and it's actually very difficult to answer one by one. But I'll try to pick on some of the key items. So, in terms of going forward, we do believe that, number one, there's going to be many models in the market going forward. For the large companies, I think each one of us have a foundation model.And the model would be supporting our own use cases, as well as offer it to the market, both on a 2C basis, as well as on a 2B basis. And at the same time, there will be many start-ups which will be, you know, creating their own models. Some of them may be general foundation models, some of them may be more industry and vertical models, and they would be coming with new applications. I think, overall, it's going to be a very vibrant industry from a model availability perspective.And then in terms of applications, I think there will be a lot of different applications. Overall, the user-to-machine interactions, in particular, search and information generation, and those type of applications would actually be more disruptive. And at the same time, there will be more of a rush of applications appearing in those use cases. So, general search, vertical search, in terms of content aggregation, a lot of these kind of applications would see new disruptors coming into play.In terms of the user-to-user interaction type of services like social network and short video network and games, long video content, there will be, you know, a lot of usages that helps to increase the quality of content, the efficiency at which the content is created, as well as lowering the cost of content creation, and that would be net beneficiary to these applications. Now, in terms of -- you asked about regulation, and we felt the government's general stance is like, you know, is supportive of regulation, but the industry has to be regulated. And I think this is not something that's specific to China, even around the world. And if you look at the U.S., there's a lot of public discussion about having regulation.And even the founder of OpenAI has been testifying and asking for regulation in the industry. So, I think that is something which is necessary. But we felt under the right regulation and regulatory framework, then the government stance is supportive of innovation and the industry will actually have room for healthy growth. And then availability of chips at this point in time, chips are largely available and there are some workarounds of GPUs that can be sold in China.And I think everybody is actually trying to get supplies. There may be short-term shortages here and there and everybody is actually clamoring for allocation, but over time, these chips will be available. And, you know, all the players who want to build foundation models will be able to get the chips to build the models.Ronald Keung -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystThank you. This is super useful. Thank you, Martin and James.Wendy HuangThank you. We'll take the next question from Kenneth Fong from Credit Suisse.Kenneth Fong -- Credit Suisse -- AnalystHi. Good evening, management. Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on the strong results. I have two questions.The first one is regarding the gap between revenue and earnings growth. Notice that in our quarter, our earnings have outpaced top-line growth meaningfully on the back of a video account monetization, operating leverage, as well as cost optimization. How should we think about this gap over the next few quarters, consider all these moving parts and drivers? And my second question is related to the tax. Our effective tax rate is quite high this quarter, driven by one-off deferred tax of overseas subsidiaries.But we didn't seem to find the adjustment in the non-GAAP net profit. So, how should we think about this one-off impact in our adjusted net profit, if any? Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerYeah. Thank you, Kenneth. So, as you observed, the gap between revenue growth and non-IFRS net income growth was unusually wide this quarter on a year-on-year basis. On the other hand, if you look at the two-year CAGR, then the revenue growth and the operating profit -- non-IFRS operating profit growth was basically identical on a two-year CAGR.So, what's the right message to take for looking forward? It's somewhere in between, meaning that the breadth of the gap this quarter between revenue and non-IFRS profit growth was abnormally large because of the low base non-IFRS profit in the same quarter a year ago, and we do expect that gap to narrow as the base effect normalizes. On the other hand, we believe we are a structurally more cost-conscious, more efficient company going forward than we were in the past, which would be helpful for margins. And many of our newer revenue streams such as video accounts, such as monetization of the e-commerce livestreaming, such as the mini program and mini game revenue is coming in at relatively high gross margins, which is a positive margin mix shift for us versus in previous years. We've been generally subject to negative margin mix shifts.So, overall, I think that we can aspire to potentially grow profits in line with or faster than revenue. But the delta between profit growth and revenue growth was unusually wide in the first quarter because of the base effect and some of the other factors that we mentioned.John Lo -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah. The deferred tax adjustment is not non-IFRS adjustment. The -- we usually look at the effective tax rate on a yearly basis rather than on a quarterly basis as there are bits and pieces of true-up happening from time to time, including, say, for instance, this time there might be, you know, some withholding tax in order as we want to remit more money out of the country, as well as, you know, adjustment on some of the deferred tax in here. But to give you an overall view of the effective tax rate, we expect that on a non-IFRS basis in the course of 2023, it would be in the range of 18% to 20%.Kenneth Fong -- Credit Suisse -- AnalystThank you, James and John. Very clear.Wendy HuangThank you, Ken. Next question will be from Esme Pau from --Esme Pau -- Macquarie Group -- AnalystHi. Thank you, Wendy, and also, management, for the opportunity to ask questions, and also congrats on the solid results. So, I do have a follow-up question on generative AI. So, I think, in the previous question, you very helpfully explained the use cases and also monetization strategy.So, just to follow up, in March, so the media reported that we may have already started developing the HunyuanAide. So, keen to hear more updates on the potential product launch. And [Inaudible] follow-up will be in relation to the training data of Hunyuan. Does that encapsulate open internet data? And also, what's the impact on interoperability and also digital walled gardens? Thank you.Martin Lau -- PresidentOK. So, in terms of our foundation model-building exercise, Hunyuan, and the -- I think the headline is that we're making good progress. And if you look into the different components, right, so the model building is actually progressing well. I think you mentioned about data, and data collection is basically across the entire internet and with specific addition of the data in China.And in terms of data in China, it's on high-quality public data, as well as high-quality public data within our content ecosystem. As you know, we have actually a lot of contents that are in-house, and that is quite unique addition to the overall data. In terms of the training, we are scaling up our training organization and the entire production line of training. And in terms of infrastructure, it's a core strength for us given our cloud business.And we have also recently, as Pony mentioned, announced our high-performance computing cluster based on NVIDIA H800 GPUs. And so, that would actually give us an additional efficiency in terms of the training. And I think one key strength for us is obviously the use cases, right? We have different products teams already planning some interesting offerings alongside with their products. So, overall, I think it's actually making good progress, and we continue to believe that AI is a growth multiplier for the industry and, in particular, for Tencent because, as we mentioned last time, our core user-to-user services is not subject to disruption but can benefit greatly from being enhanced by foundation models because it can actually help these services to generate content -- appealing content on large scale at a low cost.And all these are helpful to improve the quality of the service, improve monetization, and also lower the cost. And then foundation models also facilitates our introduction of user-to-machine services. For example, it provides a new angle for us to provide to our search, both within Weixin and on our browsers, as well as if you look forward a bit longer, there could be interesting digital assistance that could be launched in our services. And of course, cloud is actually very important as well because we felt that the foundation model, over time, can actually provide very compelling services on the cloud for our enterprise clients and also enable our PaaS and SaaS to be more competitive.Esme Pau -- Macquarie Group -- AnalystRight. Sure. Thanks. That's helpful.Martin Lau -- PresidentThank you.Wendy HuangThank you, Esme. Next question comes from William Packer from the BNP.William Packer -- Exane BNP Paribas -- AnalystHi, management. Many thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, last quarter, you provided a helpful update on develops around the domestic regulatory backdrop. Specifically, could you update us on recent news flow around domestic gaming, short-form video, and fintech? And as a follow-up, the domestic gaming momentum improved markedly in the quarter.With comps easing over the course of the year and new content coming to the market, could we expect growth to accelerate and potentially to return to double digits for that business line? Thank you.Martin Lau -- PresidentOK. In terms of the regulatory environment, I think, on the overall basis, regulatory environment continues to trend toward normalized regulation and the government is actually very focused on economic development, as well as supporting healthy development of the digital economy and industry. Some new -- the latest news bite is on April 28th, President Xi chaired a meeting of the Politburo, and he called for promoting regulated, healthy development of platform companies and encouraging innovation of leading platform companies. I think this is very significant continuation of the expression of support for the overall industry.And in terms of the different industries that you talked about, right, in terms of domestic gaming, I would say it continues a status of normalized regulation, and game licenses have been approved on a regular basis. And that's part of the reason why we're seeing a pretty good traction on the overall gaming industry in China. In terms of short-form video, I think there has not been much update, and it's not a focus of regulatory action, so far. In terms of fintech, I would say the industry is starting to move into the process of normalization of regulation.And if you look at the entire history, right, in the year of 2021, the PBOC started requiring self-review of fintech services by platform companies for the entire industry and it also conducted a routine inspection on Tenpay, which was widely reported. Through that process, we have been fully cooperative, and we have proactively adjusted our operations accordingly -- according to the requirement of PBOC. So, I think that inspection now is approaching and conclusion of the inspection results are in the process of being finalized. When such results are concluded and released, then we believe we would then see the regulators will be focused on normalized regulation, and they will also devote more resources in supporting the development and innovation in the overall industry.So, that's the regulatory update, both on a macro basis and with respect to the different industries.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerAnd, Will, on games, I recognize your question was primarily around the domestic China game business, but if you take a step back, then, you know, our global game revenue grew at a low double-digit rate year on year in the quarter, which was gratifying. And we believe that the industry globally has now worked through some transitional challenges, including a sort of post-COVID hangover in the West, including the lack of new game licenses in China. And as a result, the industry can revert closer to its historic high single-digit growth rate CAGR. And whether we outperform or underperform the overall industry will be largely a function of the quality of the content we can bring to bear.But generally speaking, over time, we have been able to outgrow this global game industry growth rate of high single digits through a combination of operating some of the biggest, best, most evergreen games that I talked about earlier, as well as housing some of the most successful and creative studios in the game industry, as well as operating high growth game platforms such as our emerging mini game platform. So, for all those reasons, we think that there's everything to play for and that the industry is back on a growth track globally, and we should work toward growing with or faster than the industry globally. Thank you.Wendy HuangThank you. We will take the next question from Charlene Liu from HSBC.Charlene Liu -- HSBC -- AnalystThank you. Thank you for taking my question. I would like to ask about overseas M&A. Clearly, we've seen really strong numbers in the international game segment in Q1.I would like to get an update from the management on M&A strategy for this segment and, you know, your view on competitive landscape, especially after some of the M&A activities from our competitors and how should we think about growth for the rest of the year. I'll have one follow-up on advertising. Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerSo, thank you for the question, Charlene. The competitive landscape for the acquisitions of game companies outside China has been fairly stable for the past few years. And while there are a number of companies that are acquisitive in this space, often their objectives do not overlap with our objectives, meaning they may be companies with a big console installed base and they're trying to acquire game studios to supercharge that console installed base, or they may be companies which are valued on near-term earnings and they're trying to bolt on additional earnings, versus in our case, we're not married to any single hardware device. And so, we've been acquisitive with mobile game studios, acquisitive with PC game studios, periodically active with console game studios as well.And in addition, we're very willing to look forward three or five or seven years when we do these investments in acquisitions. And so, it's often the case that we're looking at a company that has released a successful niche game the previous year, and we know for a certainty that that company's revenue will be declining for the next couple of years because it will be digesting the success of the first game. And in many cases, we know the company will be loss making for a period of time because we're scaling up the team to work on a much bigger sequel, but we don't get to have the bigger revenue from the bigger sequel, and, you know, that fits us. It doesn't fit everyone.And therefore, there are certain studios that naturally come to us and certain studios that naturally go elsewhere, which is fine. So, I wouldn't say that we've seen a dramatic change in the game industry acquisitive landscape, so far. Now, of course, you know, depending on whether certain big deal is one particular very big deal goes through or not, then we could see more change in the future, and we'll need to be active and reactive around that.Charlene Liu -- HSBC -- AnalystThat's good to know. And my second question on advertising. Earlier, you know, the management team mentioned that Weixin contributed over half of the total ad revenue. Can the management elaborate on revenue contribution by app products, for example, in the previous quarter -- in the first quarter across Moments video accounts, you know, ad network, etc.? And going forward, how should we think about revenue mix across these products and GPM trend? Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerWell, in terms of the revenue position, we won't be super specific, but Weixin, as we said, is the majority. Within that, Moments is historically the largest contributor. Mini programs and official accounts are substantially smaller and roughly similar to each other. And video accounts have sort of leapfrogged over mini programs and official accounts because there's a lot of inventory in video accounts, and that's very high revenue per 1,000 impressions in video accounts.You know, outside Weixin, then the biggest set of properties is the mobile ad network, which has had quite a pronounced bounce back in the last six to nine months. And then beyond that, there's a drop off to the long-form video, music, news, and some smaller properties around QQ and Qzone. So, that's the composition. In terms of the margin profile, then basically, all of the owned and operated properties, with the exception of long-form video, are high gross margin, versus long-form video and the ad network are inherently much lower gross margin.Charlene Liu -- HSBC -- AnalystUnderstood. Thank you.Wendy HuangThank you, Charlene. Next, we will take the question from John Choi from Daiwa.John Choi -- Daiwa Capital Markets -- AnalystOK. Thank you for taking my question. I have a question on -- you know, a follow-up on the gaming side. I think if you look at domestic game, you know, this quarter, we've seen a very strong game revenue due to existing, you know, I think, James, you mentioned evergreen.But as we go into the second quarter, second half, we do have much more gaming -- new game launches for the domestic market. So, I mean, can you kind of elaborate the growth trends? In terms of the revenue growth, as we head into the second half, should we be seeing accelerating growth, you know, as -- from -- back of that? And just a quick, you know, some housekeeping question. This quarter, I think we noticed very strong operating cash flow, more than 60 billion, but also the investing outflow cash flow was 65 billion. So, any color there? Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerSo, on games, I'm not necessarily going to answer your question because we don't provide guidance as to where the revenue lines are accelerating or decelerating beyond observing that, firstly, the strength in the first quarter was partly due to what I referred to as evergreen games, but we also saw very good growth from a number of games released in the last one to two years. And it's often the pattern with us that when the quarter we release a game, it generates relatively little monetization. And of course, that monetization doesn't translate into our P&L because of our deferral policy. But then, over subsequent quarters, if it's a good game, we see the monetization improving, we see the revenue -- the deferral starting to flow through into reported revenue.If it's a really good game, we see the daily active user count increasing. And so, recently, a number of games have fit that profile, including the Arena Breakout, which is the leading extraction shooter game in China, where we've seen good growth in DAU and in monetization as players become familiar with this new type of game that didn't exist before. We've seen very good growth in terms of both users and monetization from the auto chess game, Golden Spatula, that has over 10 million daily active users, which is, you know, rare for a new game in China and very rare for a game to build to that level over the course of two years as opposed to it gets that level very quickly and then fade away. And also quite good trends in the first quarter for our League of Legends: Wild Rift mobile game.Now, obviously, looking through the rest of this year, we have a number of big games that we intend to release domestically that we're excited about. But again, with some of those games, they'll monetize well from day one. With others, they'll monetize more gradually over time. Thank you.John Lo -- Chief Financial OfficerIn respect of the net cash flow, using investing activities of 65 billion, actually, is a little bit tricky because it usually increases some items, which is pretty normal in nature. Say, for instance, you know, out of that 65 billion, 50 billion is related to net fixed-term deposit placement, and other than that, you know, items just like capex, media content, and M&A, and each of those items maybe around 4 billion to 4-point-something billion RMB each.Wendy HuangThank you. Next, we will take the question from Jerry Liu from UBS.Jerry Liu -- UBS -- AnalystHey. Thanks, management. Yeah. I wanted to go back to the advertising business and ask about e-commerce.So, first, you know, e-commerce as a category has been an area of strength. So, I just wanted to ask whether we think some of this is share gains Tencent is taking in the ad industry from other players. And second of all, how do we think about the development of e-commerce, especially within video accounts? I remember, previously, we talked about how this is something that could take some time to ramp up. But I'm also seeing that in the first quarter, we started to generate more technology fees from e-commerce livestreaming and video accounts.So, I'm wondering if we could see more ramp-up of e-commerce-related monetization here. Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerYeah. So, in terms of the big e-commerce companies advertising with Tencent, then we're certainly experiencing share gains. I think that those share gains arise for a number of reasons. One is changing perceptions about sort of ecosystem competition, meaning that in the past, there were some companies that chose not to advertise with us because they viewed us as an ecosystem rival, and they may have reassessed that perspective over time.And then secondly, we're deploying much more sophisticated machine learning now to our advertising targeting that is particularly beneficial for big e-commerce companies with gigantic range of SKUs because now we can ingest those SKUs and then display the right SKU to the right user within the e-commerce companies' advertisements. So, that's on the e-commerce companies advertising with us.Martin Lau -- PresidentSo, in terms of e-commerce in relation to livestreaming and video accounts, we felt there's actually a very big opportunity, and part of it is already proven in the other short video companies. When you have short video, you can actually lead to livestreaming, and livestreaming can lead to e-commerce transactions. But in addition to that, we felt we can have some unique value-added component that we can provide to the merchants because we have private domain. We also have mini programs, which can actually allow us to connect with the video accounts.And as you know, there's actually a very big transaction ecosystem that's already happening on mini programs. And if you can actually start connecting that with the video accounts and livestreaming, then it would actually make the overall e-commerce ecosystem much more vibrant. And we also have payments, which is a very important enabler. So, when we have all these additional components added to the video accounts and livestreaming, we felt there's actually a very large headroom for us to grow in e-commerce.But we want to do it on a gradual basis so that we can build the infrastructure right. We can actually provide the best balance between UX experience, as well as the ROI for the merchants. And at the same time, most importantly, we actually want to make sure that the transaction ecosystem is actually of high quality. So, instead of having a lot of one-time buyers of low-quality products or certain products which are very high margin for the merchants and they basically sort of spend all the money on advertising instead of on the product quality, we actually want to make sure that the ecosystem is built right so that it delivers the right value for the users, as well as for the merchants, and the overall transaction ecosystem is healthy.So, that would take some time. But we felt if we do all this right, there's actually a very long runway for us to grow this part of the business.Jerry Liu -- UBS -- AnalystUnderstood. Thank you.Wendy HuangThank you, Jerry. We will take the last question from Robin Zhu from Bernstein.Robin Zhu -- AllianceBernstein -- AnalystHi. Thank you. Thanks, management, for taking the question. I guess two questions, if I may.One, just on your operating expenses. I mean, you're clearly showing impressive cost discipline and with operating expenses trending the way they have. Just curious to hear your thoughts on at what point does the company pivot more toward spending on growth, whether it's on new games, whether it's on AI and kind of related services or, you know -- and/or what's in your mind is the trigger to kind of go back on the front foot and spend more if the consumption recovery to date hasn't done that already? And the second question on gaming, James, you mentioned a while back that macro was having an impact on kind of willingness to pay and gaming ARPU as a result. Just curious to hear your thoughts on whether the recovery in Q1 is pent-up demand and, therefore, you know, would there be questions about sustainability and how the recovery looks between kind of, you know, games -- high ARPU games where whales dominate versus these large DAU games where everyone kind of buy skins and ARPU is generally lower.Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerThank you. So, on the second question, we saw quite a broad-based recovery for our game business. I think out of our top 15 games, 12 of them were up year on year. So, this wasn't a matter of one or two games bouncing while the others languished.Our overall portfolio uplifted. And whether that's due to pent-up demand or just underlying demand, time will tell, but I explained earlier why I think it's underlying demand. On the operating expenses, then there will be situations, whether it be a new game launch or buying and then depreciating GPUs for our large language model where we need to invest, and we will invest aggressively. But that said, I think that we will also keep operating expenses under quite tight control going forward.And one reason is because we've become structurally more efficient. Second reason is that, generally, we're mix shifting toward inherently higher-margin activities, as with bulk those up while exiting some inherently low-margin activities. And more broadly, you spoke about when do we need to pivot to investing for growth? And now, I think, actually, if you dig into our range of businesses, there's a number of emergent growth drivers, be it the video accounts advertising monetization, be it the e-commerce livestreaming monetization, be it the mini program and mini games. And what's interesting is each of those are very sizable opportunities, which are becoming meaningful and have very long runways to expand over time.But in none of those do we need to spend a great deal of extra money to make them more popular. You know, we aren't incurring gigantic subsidies on providing community group buying food solutions. We aren't inducing users who would otherwise be on another short video service to install video accounts and spend time on video accounts instead. You know, we're just providing what we think are very attractive and somewhat differentiated experiences to users within our big apps, particularly Weixin, and letting users -- over time, you discover those, enjoy those, socialize those, and spend more time and ultimately more money on those.So, I don't think that we're in a sort of nongrowth mode and, you know, at some point in the future, we need to flick a switch and dramatically increase sales and marketing or subsidies to go back to growth mode. I think we're in growth mode right now. It's just that the nature of our growth drivers is that they do not require heavy subsidies, they do not require heavy sales and marketing activity.

            "description": "HONG KONG, May 17 (Reuters) - China's Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK) marked a return to revenue growth in the first quarter as it recovered from COVID-19-related disruptions and China's crackdown on video games a year earlier.The world's largest video game company and operator of the WeChat messaging platform on Wednesday posted an 11% rise in revenue, beating analyst expectations.Revenue reached 149.98 billion yuan ($21.70 billion) for the three months ended March 31, topping the 146.09 billion expected by 17 analysts polled by Refinitiv.Net profit rose 11% to 25.83 billion yuan, missing the 29.61 billion expected by analysts.Tencent posted its first annual revenue decline last year, impacted by China's now-abandoned zero-COVID policy and a months-long freeze on gaming licences by regulators.But it is likely heading for a rebound this year after the government resumed licence approvals last year and gamers continue to splurge on its existing games. The firm unveiled a long pipeline of games on Monday, including seven titles ready to go online this summer.Two of Tencent's most popular games -- Honour of Kings and CrossFire -- earned record revenue thanks to new added features and promotions, while newly launched games also recorded solid sales and user growth.Domestic gaming revenue gained 6% to 35.1 billion yuan while international gaming revenue rose 25% to 13.2 billion yuan.A Tencent logo is seen in Beijing, China September 4, 2020.

Revenue from fintech and business services grew 14% to 48.7 billion yuan.Martin Lau, Tencent's president, told analysts China's regulations for fintech were moving towards normalization. China's central bank started an inspection of Tencent's payment service WeChat Pay, also known as Tenpay, in 2021.\"The inspection results are in the process of being finalized,\" Lau said.Lau said Tencent was \"making good progress\" in building AI models and the Chinese government was supportive of innovations in the area.While the U.S. imposed export controls on AI chips that can be shipped to China last year, Lau said chips were largely available \"and there are workarounds of GPUs that can be sold in China.\"($1 = 6.9121 Chinese yuan renminbi)Reporting by Josh Ye; Editing by Christopher Cushing and Edwina GibbsOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "description": "HONG KONG, May 17 (Reuters) - Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) is cutting prices for cloud services by up to 40% from June amid similar moves from rivals that have plunged the sector into a price war.The fierce competition comes amid soft corporate demand, with the Chinese economy in the midst of a wobbly recovery since abandoning strict COVID-19 restrictions last year.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (9988.HK) said last month it would slash prices for some cloud products by up to 50%. State-owned China Mobile (0941.HK) joined Tencent on Tuesday in announcing cuts, saying prices for some services would be reduced by up to 60% for a limited time.Charlie Chai, an analyst at 86Research, said Chinese cloud service providers had in the past made efforts to avert a price war but \"at the end of the day they still went down this path\". He noted the companies had expanded aggressively and now had too much capacity.Wei Yunfeng, a researcher at data firm IDC, said the price cuts were triggered in part by high sales targets despite slowing growth for the market.Chai said a more challenging cloud market would force companies to focus on product differentiation and that Baidu (9888.HK) was well positioned as it had \"unique, AI-centric products\".A man walks outside the Tencent headquarters in Nanshan district of Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China September 2, 2022.

            "description": "On Monday, Tencent Games held its annual gaming conference Spark 2023 online, introducing dozens of new gaming-related titles and projects. The Chinese gaming giant also highlighted a slew of \u201csocial value\u201d projects using gaming technology, in an attempt to show that the gaming industry can have a positive impact upon society as it emerges from a lengthy period of regulatory scrutiny in China.Why it matters: China\u2019s gaming industry has faced heavy regulation since the summer of 2021 but saw signs of this easing earlier this year as licenses for new games continued to return to regular levels. Tencent Games, the leading company in China\u2019s gaming sector, is eager to prove to the regulators that the industry can provide value to society, outside of just producing popular entertainment.Details: Tencent introduced a series of new projects using gaming technology for \u201csocial value,\u201d including a flight simulator, a game-driven robot-learning project, a 3D online tour of the Great Wall, and games related to clinical research. The gaming unit also announced 26 updates on its more traditional gaming titles, including new games and new updates on hit titles such as Honor of Kings.Tencent will launch a full-motion flight simulator next month. The simulator is based on a gaming engine developed by Tencent Games\u2019 CROS (Common R&D and Operation Systems) unit and was created jointly with Nanhang Xiangyi, a subsidiary of China Southern Airlines. Tencent said during the event that the simulator aims to create a more realistic and efficient training scenario for pilots.A new robot-learning project initiated by Tencent Games\u2019 START Team and Tencent Robotics X Lab was also announced. It uses AI to generate the actions and decision-making of the robots, combining gaming and robot development. Tencent claims that the training efficiency of a single robot is improved by 20 times after CPU optimization via the project.Tencent\u2019s online tour of the Great Wall combines photo-scanning modeling, game engine, and cloud gaming technologies. The project uses gaming technology to achieve fine-detailed rendering and immersive digital imagery usually seen only in AAA games rather than cultural heritage projects. The tour is accessible through a mini-program on WeChat and has received more than 40 million views since it was launched last June. The project won one of the 2022 Global Awards for World Heritage Education Innovative Cases awarded by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The gaming giant also unveiled a similar project featuring detailed scans of the historic Buddhist artworks at the Unesco-protected site of the Mogao grottoes near Dunhuang.Another \u201csocial value\u201d project came with the showcasing of narrative puzzle game Pavlov: Brain\u2019it On, which looks to harness clinical research to \u201chelp players exercise various cognitive capacities, such as attention, thinking speed, memory, inductive reasoning, and spatial imagination,\u201d according to Tencent. The title was developed by the Chinese tech giant\u2019s Social Value Exploration Center in collaboration with NExT Studios and the Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Institute (TCCI).The firm\u2019s Social Value Exploration Center also worked on Room 301 NO.6, which aims to help the public better understand the world of Alzheimer\u2019s patients. The narrative game \u201callows users to experience, feel, and understand the lived experience of patients with Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d Tencent claims.In terms of new out-and-out gaming titles, Valorant and Lost Ark attracted significant attention at the event. Valorant is a first-person tactical hero shooter game developed and published by Riot Games in 2019, but which will now be available in China for the first time after Tencent announced a distribution deal. Valorant hit a new record with an estimated total of more than 20 million active players throughout April 2023, according to Tracker Network. The China version will start beta testing in June.Lost Ark is a 2019 MMO (massively multiplayer online) action role-playing game co-developed by Tripod Studio and Smilegate. Lost Ark will be launched for the Chinese market this summer, with unlimited pre-release reservations now open. In February, Lost Ark recorded more than 1.3 million concurrent players on Steam, according to Studio Loot. With this number, it overtook CS:GO to claim second place in the all-time concurrent peak charts, behind leader PUBG.Context: The National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA), China\u2019s gaming regulator, announced 86 new licenses for domestic games in April, the latest sign that the licensing freeze that spanned August 2021 to April 2022 has now thawed. But despite a return to relative normalcy, many gaming companies are still feeling the pressure of a tighter approval environment.Facing heavy regulation and stagnant growth at home, Tencent Games has been accelerating its expansion in overseas markets in recent months. In March, it brought its highest-grossing mobile game in China, Honor of Kings, to Brazil, where it quickly became the most downloaded mobile game in the country.",

            "description": "One of my stops in China was Shenzhen, the southern city that\u2019s home to many Chinese tech companies, like Tencent, Huawei, and DJI. I had several reasons to go to Shenzhen, but there was one that made me nervous: I wanted to go to Tencent\u2019s mysterious customer service center to get my 15-year-old social media account back.If you didn\u2019t know, the first software that launched Tencent\u2019s empire was QQ, the go-to instant messaging platform in China during the desktop internet era. From there, Tencent grew into a powerful conglomerate offering blogs, email services, music and video streaming, gaming, and eventually WeChat. For a long time before WeChat\u2019s success, a QQ account was essentially a digital identity\u2014people used it to connect with each other and access all kinds of Tencent services.I have personal archives\u2014including diary entries, chat histories, and professional emails\u2014in QQ that span more than a decade. But I haven\u2019t been able to access them since November 2021, when my account was suddenly suspended. In the months before that, I had used it to report on a story about QQ\u2019s censorship of LGBTQ content and to connect with sources for other stories I was working on. But it wasn\u2019t clear whether that activity resulted in the suspension.I tried to recover my account, but I hit a wall because it was registered with my childhood mobile number, which had long been deactivated. I basically gave up on it\u2014until I learned about the customer service center in Shenzhen.Dealing with customer service can always be frustrating: long wait times, boilerplate responses, and unhelpful representatives are the norm. Tencent offers a physical center as a last resort. If you are willing to travel to Shenzhen, you can meet with a representative in person to make your case.In January, a 16-year-old Chinese teen went viral after he traveled over 800 miles by himself to the Tencent customer service center. Like me, he\u2019d had his QQ account suspended. After months of communications with Tencent and formal complaints that went nowhere, he finally got his account back thanks to his visit.I arrived at the customer service center on a humid April day. The center is on the first floor of an office building unrelated to Tencent, yet only a few miles away from the company headquarters. It felt weirdly secretive: there was no sign on the exterior signifying what it was. A security guard stood outside the door and was eager to question all passersby about why they were there.When I walked into the reception room, six people were in the line in front of me. We were directed to go through a security detector and store all our bags and drinks. No recording, photography, or loud conversations are allowed in this center, the signs on the wall said. I tried to record audio but was soon noticed by one of the three security guards there. \u201cSir, you cannot record here,\u201d he said, before watching me delete the recording.",

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.Douyu did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside office hours in China.The Nasdaq-listed company saw its shares plunge as much as 15 per cent during pre-market trading on Monday.China's video gaming industry has been impacted by an intense regulatory crackdown that began in 2021, with the government implementing some of the world's toughest rules to clean up content and combat youth gaming addiction, including a strict online game time limit for minors.However, authorities have eased their scrutiny in recent months, with China's National Press and Publication Administration having resumed its monthly approvals of new video games, including those developed by Big Tech firms, such as Tencent, ByteDance, and Post owner Alibaba Group Holding.The Tencent headquarters in Shenzhen, southern China.

Douyu was accused of allowing the spread of \"harmful information\", such as pornographic, superstitious and gambling-related content.People play online games during the 19th China Digital Entertainment Expo & Conference in Shanghai, China, in July 2021.

Photo: VCG via Getty Images>Despite the CAC's frequent enforcement moves against online service providers, on-site inspections remain a rarity. The last time that the CAC announced such a visit was in March 2022, when its Beijing bureau dispatched a supervision team to social media platform Douban.While the regulator did not disclose the issues that led to that inspection, Douban had been known as a haven for relatively liberal online discussions, in a country where unconventional views are usually heavily censored.Prior to that visit, a consortium of officials from seven government bodies, led by the CAC, entered the offices of ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing in July 2021 to conduct China's first-ever cybersecurity review, which resulted in a US$1.2 billion fine a year later.Tencent, majority owner of China's two largest video game live streaming sites Douyu and Huya, previously wanted to merge the two platforms in 2020, but the move was later blocked by China's antitrust regulator. Following the failed merger, Tencent planned to take Douyu private, according to a Reuters report last year.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

It exited the last of its positions either late last year or early in 2023, the London-based fund manager said in an interview. His comments come even as both stocks are trading below their 10-year average valuations.A number of Asia\u2019s heavyweight tech stocks have rebounded this year amid speculation global central banks may be near the end of interest-rate hikes. That\u2019s after valuations were dragged lower in 2022 due to geopolitical tensions and a downbeat semiconductor cycle.TSMC is currently trading at about 4.2 times book value, whereas one of its main rivals Samsung Electronics Co. is at just 1.1 times.Shares in the Taiwanese chipmaker would need to fall about 15% to 20% before the fund considers investing in them, Pines said, citing the impact from a potentially recessionary environment on its logic-technology business and geopolitics as another possible negative.Warren Buffett said in an interview last month that he divested the majority of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\u2019s $4.1 billion stake in TSMC partly due to geopolitical concerns. TSMC reaffirmed its target for capital spending in its latest earnings announcement but warned demand from mobile and PC industries remains soft.Story continuesREAD: Top Greater China Fund Raises Concern Over TSMC After BuffettGrowing CompetitionMeanwhile, Tencent\u2019s growth has slowed but its shares continue to trade close to 20 times forward earnings, Pines said. The company\u2019s reliance on the international expansion of its gaming unit may be tenuous given it\u2019s a \u201clightning rod\u201d for US-China geopolitics and there\u2019s growing competition from TikTok Inc., he said.Pines\u2019 fund has been increasing its overweight in South Korean stocks over the past three-to-six months, given its view that earnings for chip heavyweight Samsung Electronics Co. are bottoming, and corporate governance in the market is improving.TSMC shares have dropped 5.6% this quarter, while Samsung\u2019s have gained about 1%, in a reversal of the former\u2019s outperformance at the start of the year. Tencent shares have slumped 15% since the end of March after more than doubling during China\u2019s reopening rally.\u201cSamsung has the ability to heavily influence the profitability of the industry,\u201d Pines said.

It says it has 640 potential orders.It had about $157.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and other financial assets as of March 31.Reporting by Shivansh Tiwary in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'SouzaOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "description": "Publicly listed electric vertical take-off and landing jet developer Lilium has announced plans to raise $250 million. According to an SEC filing, historic backer Tencent pre-funded the purchase of $100 million in shares, as well as committed to pre-fund the purchase of an additional $75 million in shares, contingent upon Lilium being able to secure a matching $75 million via \"equity, debt or grants from certain third parties\".Should the deal complete, Lilium\u2019s post-IPO equity raise would total $819 million, and bring the company\u2019s total funding raised to just shy of $1.2 billionBorn in a time of relative prosperity, today\u2019s market conditions aren\u2019t boding so well for Lilium. Back in March of 2021, the company went the SPAC route and listed on Nasdaq at a $3.3 billion valuation. Fast forward to November of last year, and the company was selling shares, $119 million worth to be exact, that were to be used for \u201cgeneral corporate purposes, which may include payment of Lilium\u2019s suppliers and working capital uses.\u201dNo one will argue that hardware is hard and there\u2019s a tremendous amount of capital that needs to be poured into a project like Lilium\u2019s before any discernible ROI makes itself known. However, with concerns over cash burn rate, a seemingly narrowing liquidity runway, and a stock price that\u2019s dropped nearly 86% year-over-year, it\u2019s a tricky situation for both Lilium and its existing investors.Adding to Lilium's headaches, the company's stock price dipped below Nasdaq's $1 share price threshold as of 1 March of this year and has remained south since. Standard operating procedure for Nasdaq is to issue a warning notice after 30 days of trading below the $1 threshold, and an additional 180 days of advance notice are provided before delisting.If Lilium is quoting $250 million to keep the lights on, Tencent\u2019s reaction and position is pretty clear, particularly considering the caveat. We\u2019ll back you with $100 million, but only provide another $75 million if you can find a matching backer - we\u2019re not going all in on this all alone.According to a statement issued by Lilium, the $250 million will see the company through to achieving its first manned flight. This flight is a crucial milestone for the company, as it then unlocks around $250 million in pre-delivery payments.\u201cThe capital raise announced today marks an important development in our ongoing mission to revolutionise the aviation industry. With this financing, we are excited to continue our development program at full pace,\u201d commented Lilium CEO Klaus Roewe. \u201cWe remain in multiple constructive discussions with existing and potential new investors. We hope to announce further updates soon.\u201d",

            "description": "Credit: Westend61/Getty ImagesA new generation of advanced machine learning has given us impressive technologies like ChatGPT, Nvidia's DLSS game sharpening, and image recognition in Google Photos. There are also deepfakes, which are no less amazing but much more problematic as they can create realistic videos featuring real people that never happened. Rather than shy away from the technology, Chinese mega-firm Tencent has announced a deepfake cloud service. Interested parties can create a digital version of a real person for a few bucks. What could go wrong?According to Tencent Cloud, the new service needs a little data to start. Customers must upload three minutes of live-action video and 100 spoken sentences to train the model. Then, in as little as 24 hours, a new digital human will be born. The result will be a video of someone saying and doing things they never did. Naturally, Tencent doesn't call this a deepfake, but that's what it is. Tencent cites the possibility that an AI-generated person could host live-streamed infomercials, a popular component of e-commerce in China. Rather than pay a person to host all those streams, a company could just order a new video for each new stream based on the data they've already collected.The fee for this service is 1,000 Yuan (about $145) for each video. Tencent will offer various video styles, including 3D realistic, 3D semi-realistic, 2D realistic, and 2D cartoon. Digital humans can be generated as full-body models or from the waist up. Tencent Cloud also boasts it can create custom Q&A videos with realistic voice tone and inflection. The service is available in Chinese as well as English.Credit: TencentDeepfakes have proliferated on the internet for several years, sometimes with legitimate uses. However, the technology is perhaps most closely associated with pornography. With enough high-resolution photos, it's possible to digitally alter a performer's face to make them appear to be someone else.It's a thorny issue. Most sites and services, including Reddit and PornHub, have banned deepfake content. There are also concerns that deepfakes could become so good they are effective for propaganda. One of the only things holding them back is a high barrier to entry\u2014you need some basic programming skills to use the necessary tools. Tencent is tearing down that barrier. It might become a profitable business model but also cause more trouble than it's worth. The Chinese government has sought to regulate deepfake content, but it's unclear how much moderation will occur before Tencent generates new digital humans.",

The two sides will also leverage the vibrant Weixin ecosystem to promote the digital transformation of various industries in the city-state.\"We look forward to the return of Chinese tourists, for whom Weixin Pay is a popular digital tool, and we hope this strategic partnership will enable tourists to enjoy even more lifestyle experiences in Singapore,\" said Andrew Phua, Executive Director of Singapore Tourism Board for Greater China. He also added that Singapore merchants can leverage Weixin's ecosystem to further upgrade their digital capabilities to better serve Chinese consumers.Weixin Pay's Li noted Singapore is a popular destination for outbound Chinese tourists and a market that Weixin Pay attaches great importance to. \"In the past, we have collaborated with the STB to promote the popularity and development of digital payment. We will work together further to provide digital solutions based on the Weixin ecosystem to create high-quality cross-border smart travel experiences for Chinese tourists,\" said Li.The strategic partnership came ahead of China's May Day holiday, also known as Golden Week holiday. The signing ceremony also highlighted multiple measures to attract Chinese tourists to Singapore from May 1 to Oct 31, in partnership with dozens of top key merchants in Singapore, including Jewel Changi Airport, CapitaLand malls, Mandai Wildlife Reserve and Sentosa. For example, Chinese tourists can enjoy a 20% discount on at selected stores when spending via Weixin Pay.According to China's online travel agency Ctrip, orders for outbound travel from the Chinese mainland as of April 6 increased 18-fold over the same period last year, while the search volume for international air tickets for the upcoming May Day holiday has increased by more than 9 times year-on-year. Singapore is among the top 10 popular destinations for outbound Chinese travelers, and their arrival is expected to help stimulate economic growth in the country.Against this background, local merchants in Singapore are actively embracing the Weixin ecosystem to welcome the return of tourists from China. Grab, Southeast Asia's leading superapp, launched its Weixin Mini Program in December last year, enabling Weixin users to directly access ride-hailing services in more than 500 cities across eight Southeast Asian countries, including Singapore. The Mandai Wildlife Group also made comprehensive use of Weixin Pay and other features of the Weixin ecosystem, such as Official Accounts, Channels and Mini Programs, to enhance customer experience and loyalty. Visitors can now easily purchase tickets, rent baby strollers and access other services through a Mini Program.The STB has also made active use of the Weixin ecosystem to deepen its connection with Chinese consumers. In addition to opening an official account and an account on Channels to promote the country's tourism, the STB has also newly revamped the \"Visit Singapore\" Mini Program, which includes travel information, policy introduction, itinerary planning and other functions. This provides one-stop services to Chinese tourists, such as travel tips and FAQs, to make the most of their trip.Today, Weixin Pay is available in all kinds of everyday services that matter most to Chinese tourists abroad, such as F&B, retail, department stores, hotels and other popular attractions. Furthermore, drawing on the practices of supporting the digital transformation of small and medium-sized enterprises in China, with the easy-to-use tools, Weixin Pay has helped nearly 10,000 Singapore hawkers go digital, enabling Chinese tourists to immerse themselves in authentic local culture.",

The researcher who investigated the incident, Facundo Mu\u00f1oz, told The Record that it was a \u201chigh-profile international NGO\u201d operating in two Chinese provinces.Researchers attributed the activity to the advanced persistent threat (APT) group Evasive Panda, also known as Bronze Highland and Daggerfly. Active since at least 2012, Evasive Panda conducts espionage against individuals and government entities in mainland China, Hong Kong, Nigeria, Myanmar, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.The campaign inside China began in 2020 and continued throughout 2021, ESET said. Evasive Panda delivered malware to victims through the QQ messaging software developed by Chinese tech giant Tencent.The software was infected with Evasive Panda\u2019s flagship backdoor called MgBot and was able to perform automatic updates, the report said.The MgBot backdoor installer was detected and removed when it was downloaded on the victim's computer, according to Mu\u00f1oz. \u201cTherefore, we assess that the attempts to compromise victims were not successful,\u201d he said.MgBot is a Windows backdoor that has existed since at least 2012 and is used to steal files and credentials and record keystrokes. In April, Evasive Panda used the malware to target a telecom company in Africa.The majority of MgBot\u2019s plugins are designed to steal information from popular Chinese applications such as QQ, WeChat, QQBrowser, and Foxmail \u2014 all developed by Tencent.Supply chain or something else?It is currently unclear how the hackers were able to use legitimate updates to deliver the malware, the report said.ESET is considering two scenarios: a supply chain compromise of Tencent QQ's update servers, or an adversary-in-the-middle attack, in which hackers intercept data in transit between two devices or by impersonating a legitimate website or network.If the QQ update servers were compromised, hackers could use this access to distinguish which users would receive either the compromised or legitimate updates, according to ESET. The company has previously investigated a comparable supply-chain attack that was used in an espionage operation aimed at online gaming communities in Asia.The adversary-in-the-middle attack would be possible if the attackers were able to compromise vulnerable devices such as routers or gateways. In 2019, ESET researchers discovered that the Chinese APT group known as BlackTech was performing this type of attack through Asus routers and delivering malware through the devices' software updates.\u201cWith access to ISP backbone infrastructure \u2014 through legal or illegal means \u2014 Evasive Panda would be able to intercept and reply to the update requests performed via HTTP, or even modify packets on the fly,\u201d Mu\u00f1oz said.Without further evidence, ESET cannot prove or discard one hypothesis in favor of the other.\u201cMany questions are left unanswered,\u201d the researchers said. \u201cWe reached out to Tencent\u2019s Security Response Center, but it could not confirm whether the full URL from where the malware was downloaded was legitimate.\u201dRecorded Future Intelligence Cloud.

Stat Of the Week is supported by Cinq Music Group, a technology-driven record label, distribution, and rights management company.Tencent Music Entertainment has published its Annual Report for 2022.Within the report, the China-based music streaming giant, which operates flagship music app QQ Music, as well as Kugou, Kuwo, plus online karaoke service, WeSing, provided an update on the number of independent artists registered on its platform.TME works directly with indie artists through a platform called \u2018Tencent Musician Platform,\u2019 previously known as \u2018Tencent Musician Program,\u2019 which launched in 2017.Since then, the company reports, the Tencent Musician Platform \u201chas empowered them to create more than 2.3 million musical works by the end of 2022\u2033.Plus, according to TME, it ended the year with a total of 390,000 registered indie artists on the platform.TME reported in its previous annual report (for 2021) that the number of registered musicians on the platform reached more than 300,000 by the end of 2021. This means that TME added 90,000 more artists on the program in 2022.By the end of Q3 2022, TME reported to have 350,000 registered indie musicians on its platform, which means that in the fourth quarter of 2022 alone, the company registered 40,000 indie artists on the Tencent Musician Platform.TME\u2019s latest count, however, lags behind its rival NetEase Cloud Music. By the end of 2022, NCM\u2019s version of the Tencent Musician Platform counted more than 611,000 registered indie artists, producing about 2.6 million tracks.TME says in a recent stock exchange filing announcing its annual 2022 results that Tencent Musician Platform is an online service for select aspiring musicians \u201cto showcase their talent, passion and original works for the broadest possible audience.\u201dThe platform provides tools and collaborative opportunities to help artists create, grow, engage and monetize their art. These resources aid indie artists from song production and domestic and overseas promotion, to artist and repertoire development, incentive plans, performance resources, copyright protection and career training.The platform helps artists distribute their music to over 150 platforms worldwide including Spotify, YouTube and Apple Music.Last year, TME said it rolled out several incentive programs to help artists gain exposure across its platforms. TME is one of the most dominant players in China\u2019s music streaming market. It operates its flagship music app QQ Music, as well as Kugou, Kuwo, plus online karaoke service, WeSing.In July, the company launched a real-time data and analytics suite for artists and their teams called \u2018TME Business Intelligence for Artists.\u2019That follows the launch of a distribution service in April called \u2018One-Click For All,\u2019 which allows indie artists to register to the Tencent Musician Platform.TME Chief Executive Officer Ross Liang told analysts during an earnings call in March that over 60,000 indie artists on the Tencent Musician Platform have used the One-Click feature by the end of 2022 to publish their original songs on WeChat Video Accounts, Tencent\u2019s challenger to TikTok, Kuaishou and other popular short-form video-sharing platforms in China.Tencent Music executives last month revealed more plans in the pipeline for indie artists.\u201cWe are creating more room for our indie musicians to grow into promising live streaming performance.\u201d Tony Yip, Tencent Music Entertainment\u201cWe are creating more room for our indie musicians to grow into promising live streaming performance. For instance, in the fourth quarter, our self-produced hit songs like Puppetry, helped their singers grow the number of fans substantially, thereby increasing both copyright revenue and live streaming income,\u201d said TME Chief Scientific Officer Tony Yip.In December, TME unveiled a record release feature, allowing independent artists to upload their original albums and earn revenue from listeners.These efforts come amid the exploding indie artist market in China.By the end of last year, TME had 88.5 million paying users, up 16.1% from 2021. Its revenue from online music services jumped 8.9% YoY to RMB12.48 billion (approx. $1.8 billion), \u201cdriven by strong growth in music subscription revenues, supplemented by growth in revenues from long form audio, despite a decrease in sublicensing revenues and advertising revenues.\u201dCinq Music Group\u2019s repertoire has won Grammy awards, dozens of Gold and Platinum RIAA certifications, and numerous No.1 chart positions on a variety of Billboard charts.

            "description": "In the lead-up to the Shanghai Auto Show, we've interviewed Shuman Liu, Vice President of Tencent Intelligent Mobility, about the importance of cloud-based solutions in the development of autonomous driving (AD), some technical highlights and why Tencent is the right cloud technology partner for its rollout.Shuman Liu, Vice President of Tencent Intelligent Mobility.What conditions are required for the development of AD technology?With its complicated road systems, mega cities, dense populations and unique traffic behaviors, China poses challenges for AD development. It also provides richer scenarios, plentiful data and greater numbers of rare and unexpected so-called \u201ccorner cases\u201d essential for the safe and effective evolution of AD technology.Add to that a unique Gen-z demographic that plans to purchase a car with Level2+ standards of driver assistance functions and you have ideal training conditions for AD. That\u2019s why global original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are establishing major research and development (R&D) teams in China and promoting those solutions worldwide.How is Tencent meeting the AD and cloud needs of international companies?Tencent has taken the lead and launched a one-stop Intelligent Vehicle Cloud platform that can meet technological requirements at every stage of the AD development process. The foundation of the platform is the company\u2019s security and compliance capabilities, along with all the necessary toolchains.Our advanced cloud data storage ecosystem addresses challenges around the huge data volume and high storage costs involved in the development of AD. Tencent\u2019s flexible out-of-the-box, low-cost tools also ensure a smooth user experience. Meanwhile, end-to-end security and compliance in our cloud-to-vehicle integration architecture resolve complex compliance issues when entering a new market.What are some key features and advantages of the platform?As to the security and compliance service, the loop begins within the car, where all perception data will be encrypted and transferred onto the platform. Only desensitized and anonymous data will be available for use by the R&D team working in a fully secure and compliant data-closed loop.Tencent has developed software-hardware integrated architecture to provide stable operation and low energy consumption for managing such large volumes of data required for simulations and modeling. The system is high-density, high-performance, reliable and can reduce storage costs by 50 percent compared to standard practice.What\u2019s more, Tencent provides high-performance solutions by leveraging its AI capabilities for large-scale AD training. This can reduce network congestion by 40 percent and total training costs by 25 percent.In building an AI model, polishing individual functions is not enough, so we equipped the TI platform with services covering:1. Data transfer, when storage and computation can be separated, resulting in a reduction of the transfer period by 80 percent.2. Data processing, with an easy-to-use rich labeling database that can cut labeling costs by 70 percent.3. Model training with a drag-and-drop function, model evaluation and post-processing, which can improve efficiency by 50 percent.To meet the validation requirements of AD testing, we also provide TAD Sim, an advanced simulation program that integrates gaming technology and cloud capacity. Performance-wise, the program can realize 90 percent accuracy for perception models, vehicle dynamics and traffic.TAD Sim provides more than three million scenarios in its data set and supports real-time simulation for vast city-scale areas. Under this complex simulation environment, TAD Sim can generate random corner cases to test the completeness of the AD algorithm and enrich the scenario database. Its capabilities mean that the safety and efficiency of testing will greatly improve.Accurate maps are another important component of AD development. Tencent has launched a vehicle-map-cloud solution to provide regular on-demand map updates and location-based services that can be tailored to different OEMs at low cost and with high coverage.Can you provide examples of how international companies are benefiting from Tencent\u2019s cloud solutions?We are partnering with more than 100 OEMs and AD development companies, who have tapped us for our open ecosystem, technology and solid infrastructure.We have partnered with Bosch to provide them with worry-free R&D environment, allowing their team to focus on AD technology development with our full-stack services.Our strategic partnership with Nio has expanded from AD and maps to areas such as building a hybrid cloud infrastructure to support their AD development and operation, and providing our TAI smart cockpit solution to explore new in-car possibilities.As autonomous driving enters the commercialization stage, OEMs should prepare by setting up dedicated teams to handle issues and continuously enhance the customer experience. Customer satisfaction is the core competency for any vehicle and our Intelligent Vehicle Cloud platform provides the framework to deliver that for companies.",

            "description": "Chinese social media, cloud, and entertainment giant Tencent on Monday revealed that it has started mass production of a home brew video transcoding accelerator.The announcement comes nearly two years after the company unveiled a trio of custom chips designed to accelerate everything from streaming video to networking and artificial intelligence workloads.In a post published on WeChat, Tencent Cloud revealed that \"tens of thousands\" of its Canghai chips, which are designed to offload video encode/decode for latency sensitive workloads, have been deployed internally to accelerate cloud gaming and live broadcasting.Tencent says the Canghai chip can be paired with GPUs from a variety of vendors to support low-latency game streaming. When used for video transcoding, Tencent said a single node equipped with Canghai can deliver up to 1,024 video channels . We'll note that Nvidia, with the launch of its L4 GPUs last month, made similar claims. Without real-world benchmarks, it's hard to say how either firm's claims stack up.With that said, Tencent says its chip can achieve superior quality at the same bitrate as competing GPU-based accelerators, with latencies for a single 1080p frame of just four milliseconds. But again, it's not stated which GPUs it's comparing its results against.Whatever the real world results, the promised improvement in compression efficiency should allow Tencent to maintain current streaming quality while reducing the bandwidth consumed \u2014 although some of this improvement could be down to support for better codecs.The Canghai chip reportedly supports H.264, HEVC, and AV1. As we've previously reported, AV1 is a relatively new codec that in addition to being royalty free, is also exceptionally efficient. Testing puts AV1 at somewhere between 20 and 40 percent more efficient compared to popular web streaming codecs, like HEVC.Custom compute for the Chinese cloudWhen it comes to spinning custom chips to improve the efficiency and economics of cloud computing, Amazon Web Services gets a lot of credit. The American e-tail giant and cloud titan has developed everything from custom CPUs, AI training and inference accelerators, and smartNICs to offload many housekeeping workloads.And while Google has developed an accelerator of its own, called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), most US cloud providers have largely stuck with commercially available parts from the likes of Intel, AMD, Ampere, Broadcom, or Nvidia, rather than designing their own.However, in China, custom chips appear to be more prevalent, with development an imperative accelerated by US sanctions that mean some tech products can't be exported to the Middle Kingdom.In addition to its Canghai video chips, Tencent also created the Zixiao AI \"reasoning\" chip which it's deployed internally, plus the Xuanling network processor. The latter is designed to offload and accelerate networking, storage, and compute workloads, which sounds an awful lot like a smartNIC.Tencent's local peer Alibaba Cloud has also created custom silicon. In April 2022 the cloud provider showed off its custom Arm CPUs and DPUs.The cloudy business unit of e-commerce giant Alibaba began previewing its Yitian 710 processor, which reportedly features 128 Armv9 cores running at 3.2GHz, eight channels of DDR5, and 96 lanes of PCIe 5.0, about a year ago in its Elastic Compute Service.Meanwhile, Alibaba's Cloud Infrastructure Processing Unit (CIPU), much like AWS Nitro cards, is designed to offload virtualization functions associated with storage, networking, and security that would otherwise be handled by the main CPU.And while not fully custom, Baidu has tapped RISC-V chipmaker StarFive to help it develop high-performance products based on the open ISA. However, it remains to be seen when, or whether, these chips will come into play. \u00ae",

            "description": "The last two years have been awful for Tencent Holdings Limited (TCEHY -0.22%). Once a darling, the tech conglomerate's stock price almost halved from its peak of around $90 per share.With its stock price much cheaper today, should investors take a bite of this leading Chinese tech company? Let's explore this further in the article.Tencent's recent performance has been disappointing.Tencent has arguably had one of the best long-term track records for growth. Since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2004, revenue and net profit have grown by an annualized rate of 44%.Its flawless performance, however, fell short lately as it delivered its first-ever annual decline in revenue. Net profit for the year performed worse, down by 17% year over year. The weaker performance was across the board, except for the fintech and business services segment, which reported a slight revenue increase. The regulatory crackdown on online learning and internet industries in China, and the ongoing negative impact of COVID-19 were some of the main drivers behind its weak performance.It did not help that one of the central themes from Tencent throughout 2022 was about improving efficiency and controlling costs. In a way, it signaled to investors that the company would unlikely resume the kind of growth it had experienced in the first 16 years since its IPO.Don't get me wrong. There is nothing wrong with a company improving its cost structure and efficiency. On the contrary, such a move was necessary during a challenging environment. But for Tencent's diehard fans, it might be disheartening to think that the company's hyper-growth days might be over.Tencent's long-term growth prospects remain attractiveLet's face it. No company can continue to grow at 44% forever. And at its size -- $80 billion annual revenue -- Tencent is already a giant, so it's natural that its growth slows down over time.Still, there are good reasons to believe that the company can continue to grow -- albeit slower -- by leveraging its twin engine of the franchise business and external investments.The former relies on its social media networking services (mainly WeChat and QQ) and 1.3 billion monthly active users (MAU). As the dominant messaging service in China, Tencent can leverage its user base to offer an ever-expanding catalog of services to improve monetization. It already provides services like payments, gaming, online video, e-commerce, and music and is well-positioned to add new products over time.On top of that, Tencent can rely on its capital allocation skills to divert unused cash into external investments. JD.com, Pinduoduo, Meituan, and Sea Limited are examples of Tencent's successful past investments. The beauty of this strategy is that Tencent has the flexibility to invest anywhere globally that it sees fit and in any company -- both listed and private -- across multiple industries. Think of it as Berkshire Hathaway but for technology companies.With its twin engine for growth, Tencent has plenty of opportunities to allocate capital to grow shareholder value in the coming years.So is Tencent stock a buy?Tencent faces short-term headwinds from the Chinese government crackdown and the generally weak external economy. However, the tech behemoth should resume its upward trajectory in the longer term by growing its internal businesses and investment portfolio.On balance, I'm cautiously optimistic about the company's prospects over the next few years. And with the stock trading at a reasonable price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 16, I don't think it's too irrational for long-term investors to buy stock in the company.Still, investors should expect a volatile ride ahead.",

Tencent Video is a streaming service that produces some of China\u2019s most popular TV dramas, and clips from these dramas often feature in short videos on Douyin. Tencent Videos comes under Tencent, which is also responsible for Tencent News and the WeChat messaging app, whilst Douyin Group comes under ByteDance.This was previously a major sore spot between the two companies, with Tencent suing Douyin multiple times for damages over original content appearing on the short video site. As compensation, Douyin has deleted thousands of videos from its site and paid up to 3 billion RMB (430 million USD) in damages since 2021.The new agreement signals a significant step up in interoperability between the companies, an agenda the Chinese government has been pushing for some time. Interoperability refers to any kind of connectivity between platforms owned and operated by different tech companies. A lack of interoperability can mean, for example, that users cannot open a link to a product on the e-commerce site Taobao within the messaging app WeChat, since these platforms are owned by two different companies (Alibaba and Tencent respectively).Amid China\u2019s two-year-long tech crackdown, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has been pushing to tear down these \u201cwalled gardens\u201d. Fostering greater inoperability addresses the government\u2019s aim of maintaining a competitive tech industry. It also curbs the influence of individual tech companies, helping power stay concentrated in the hands of the Party.The new agreement will free Douyin of the financial burden of consecutive lawsuits and promote content creation on the site among fans of Tencent Video\u2019s dramas. Likewise, Tencent Video will benefit from engagement in these short videos, which will drive more traffic to the streaming service.ShareJoin our newsletter",

            "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd. tumbled by the most in over two months on signs that its largest shareholder Prosus NV may extend the selling of the Chinese tech firm\u2019s stock.Most Read from BloombergThe internet company\u2019s shares dropped 5.2% to HK$357.2 in Hong Kong, the most since late January, after news that Prosus planned to deposit an additional 96 million of shares into the city\u2019s stock clearing system, typically a precursor to selling. Prosus shares fell as much as 5.5% in Amsterdam while parent Naspers declined as much as 3.6% in Johannesburg.Tencent\u2019s internet peers that trade in the US saw shares falling in premarket trading, with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com Inc. both down by more than 1.5%. The exchange-traded KraneShares CSI China Internet Fund dropped 1.6%.\u201cIt\u2019s likely that Prosus will speed up their selling of Tencent shares when it\u2019s near the level of HK$400,\u201d said Steven Leung, an executive director at UOB Kay Hian. \u201cTencent has been buying back their shares to offset the market impact of big holders selling every day, but still, such negative news would always cause some concern.\u201dProsus, an early investor in Tencent through its Cape Town-based parent Naspers Ltd., first started its campaign to pare back holdings in mid-2022 as a way to fund its own share buyback. The stock sales are an open-ended process and chief executive Bob van Dijk has said that those trades will be executed in small chunks of between 3% to 5% of daily volumes.As of January this year, Prosus said it sold more than 193 million Tencent shares for a net proceed of $7.2 billion, cutting its position to about 26.9% from 29% in June 2022. Prosus\u2019 selling and its buyback could help bridge the gap between its market value and the value of assets that it holds, analysts have said.Story continues\u201cWe continue with our open-ended share repurchase program of Prosus and Naspers shares as per our previously announced strategy,\u201d a Prosus spokesperson said by email.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:Prosus looks set to continue its gradual Tencent selldown, funding a share buyback. On top of some business simplification this has greatly reduced the holding-company discount and may remove it consistently in time. More dramatic action is possible \u2014 perhaps via a carve-out of one or more divisions \u2014 though this may be a year or more away.\u2014John Davies, BI Senior Industry AnalystMeanwhile, Tencent has also tried to buy back some of its shares as a way to mitigate the slump. In its current round of buybacks that started on March 27, Tencent has purchased a combined 8.3 million shares. Still, the buybacks have done little to stem further share price declines given broader jitters about a regulatory crackdown and Covid\u2019s impact on the economy.Though shares have slipped this week, they are still some 87% higher from an October low following China\u2019s reopening measures. Tencent\u2019s plans to develop a ChatGPT-like bot and a resumption of new game approvals are helping support some gains.\u201cTencent\u2019s share price always takes a hit when there\u2019s news of Prosus selling,\u201d said Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee. \u201cBut the sale doesn\u2019t affect the fundamentals of Tencent.\u201dProsus has a regulatory requirement to disclose its interest in Tencent every time it goes down a percent. The investment firm did that in December last year, when its holding dropped just below 27%. The company has reduced its holding from 29% since starting the program in June 2022.--With assistance from John Cheng, Loni Prinsloo, Kit Rees and Henry Ren.(Updates with Bloomberg Intelligence in 8th paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

It cited two investors briefed on the numbers. Tencent reported EBITDA of 164 billion yuan ($23.9 billion) for 2022 in its preliminary earnings statement. Meanwhile, Alibaba\u2019s figure for the same period is about $22.7 billion, according to Bloomberg-compiled data.Bloomberg reported last week that ByteDance\u2019s revenue surged more than 30% to surpass $80 billion in 2022. That matched the tally at archrival Tencent, after twin video platforms TikTok and Douyin drew eyeballs and advertisers from social media incumbents.Alibaba owns Taobao, No. 1 in the Digital Commerce 360 database of Global Online Marketplaces. It also owns Tmall (No. 2). JD.com is No. 4.ByteDance and the TikTok banThat double-digit growth topped most of the global internet leaders including Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., underscoring the resilience of ByteDance\u2019s business at a time Washington is threatening to join India in banning TikTok, which a growing number of government agencies across the world are wiping from official phones.advertisementThe U.S. is mulling a ban of the short-form video app because of alleged national security risks. Concerned regulators worry TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, shares private user data with the Chinese government. A TikTok ban has been proposed before. In 2020, the Trump administration publicly mulled banning the Chinese app and banned it on many government devices.ByteDance\u2019s profit last year came despite mounting losses at fast-growing TikTok, according to the Financial Times. TikTok has amassed more than 150 million monthly users in America, spurring concerns about China\u2019s access to the data it gathers. Its chief executive sat through a hostile congressional hearing, during which he did little to sway some of the loudest critics.Douyin, though, remains ByteDance\u2019s biggest cash cow. The still-robust growth at the world\u2019s most valuable private tech firm could boost confidence among investors shaken by recent global events. The Chinese social media behemoth was valued at around $220 billion in a recent private-market investment by Abu Dhabi AI firm G42, down from the $300 billion that TikTok\u2019s owner set during a September share buyback program.advertisement",

            "description": "ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of popular social media app TikTok, has reported record profits of USD 25 billion for 2022, surpassing those of tech giants Tencent and Alibaba for the first time. Despite ongoing losses in the TikTok business unit, ByteDance\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) increased by 79% year-on-year to USD 25 billion, up from USD 14 billion in the previous fiscal year.The company\u2019s revenue grew by over 30% to more than USD 80 billion, with TikTok and Douyin, its Chinese counterpart, attracting attention from social media giants and advertisers. ByteDance\u2019s double-digit revenue growth outpaced that of most global internet leaders, including Meta and Amazon, underscoring the resilience of its business model in the face of growing concerns about data handling and security.However, TikTok\u2019s future remains uncertain due to mounting regulatory pressures in the United States and other countries. The Biden administration has threatened to ban the app in the US unless ByteDance sells it, citing concerns about its data handling and potential security risks. More than a dozen other countries have partially or fully banned TikTok for similar reasons, including the UK, Canada, and Australia.Despite these challenges, an investor in ByteDance in the US believes that the TikTok ban will not significantly damage the company\u2019s financial situation at present, as TikTok accounts for only a small percentage of ByteDance\u2019s total revenue. Nevertheless, any forced sale or ban on TikTok would impact the company\u2019s potential earnings, given its rapid growth rate.ByteDance\u2019s IPO prospects also remain uncertain, as the company has repeatedly delayed its planned listing on the Hong Kong stock market since the end of 2020. Analysts say that the ongoing regulatory pressures surrounding TikTok and Ant Financial, another Chinese tech giant, have dampened investor confidence in the company\u2019s future prospects.Despite these challenges, Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, remains ByteDance\u2019s biggest cash cow, and the company\u2019s robust performance could boost investor confidence in the face of recent global events. Abu Dhabi-based artificial intelligence firm G42 recently valued ByteDance at around USD 220 billion, down from the USD 300 billion valuation set by TikTok\u2019s owner for a share buyback program in September 2022.",

            "description": "Tencent (TCEHY -0.22%) posted its fourth-quarter earnings report on March 22. The Chinese tech giant's revenue rose 0.5% year over year to 145.0 billion yuan ($20.8 billion), which still missed the consensus forecast by half a billion yuan.But its net profit increased 12% to 106.3 billion yuan ($15.3 billion), which exceeded analysts' estimates by 27.6 billion yuan. Excluding a one-time gain of 106.6 billion yuan from its exit from the shopping platform Meituan (MPNG.Y -10.76%) and other one-time items, Tencent's adjusted net profit grew 19% to 29.7 billion yuan ($4.3 billion).For the full year, Tencent's revenue dipped 1% to 554.6 billion yuan ($79.6 billion) and decelerated from its 16% growth in 2021. Its adjusted net profit fell 7% to 115.6 billion yuan ($16.6 billion), compared to its 1% growth in 2021.Tencent's slowdown is disappointing, but it wasn't too surprising since its core gaming, advertising, fintech, and cloud businesses have all faced tough macro, competitive, and regulatory challenges over the past year. But will this bellwether of the Chinese tech sector prove the bears wrong and bounce back this year?Simplifying Tencent's sprawling businessIn 2022, Tencent generated 52% of its revenue from its value-added services (VAS) division, which houses its domestic video games, international video games, and non-advertising revenues from its social media and streaming media platforms. The core growth engine of its domestic gaming business is Honor of Kings, a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game which was initially launched in 2015 and remains one of the most popular games in China.Its fintech and business services unit, which houses its WeChat Pay digital payments services and Tencent Cloud platform, brought in 32% of its revenue. Another 15% came from its online advertising business, which sells ads across its entire ecosystem of social media apps, games, and free media streams, while the remaining 1% came from its other businesses.WeChat (known as Weixin in China) is the \"super app\" that bonds users to its core VAS, advertising, and fintech businesses. WeChat's 1.31 billion monthly active users (MAUs) can access a wide range of mobile messaging, social networking, e-commerce, digital payments, media, and gaming services without ever leaving the app.What happened to Tencent over the past year?All three of Tencent's core businesses faced tough headwinds over the past year. The VAS division's growth decelerated as the Chinese government tightened its video game playtime restrictions for minors and staggered its approvals of new games. That pressure forced Tencent to aggressively expand its overseas gaming business, but that division also struggled with sluggish growth in a post-pandemic market. Its streaming media segment -- which includes Tencent Video and Tencent Music (TME) -- also faced intense competition as COVID lockdowns disrupted consumer spending.The fintech and business services segment struggled as slower consumer and enterprise spending affected WeChat Pay and Tencent Cloud, respectively. Tencent also intentionally scaled back some of Tencent Cloud's unprofitable services to cut costs, which suggests it's struggling to keep pace with its two larger competitors -- Alibaba (BABA -1.02%) Cloud and Huawei Cloud -- in China's cloud infrastructure market.Meanwhile, its online advertising business was hit by COVID disruptions, which forced many companies to rein in their ad spending, a slowdown that was exacerbated by the government's unpredictable crackdown on the country's gaming, fintech, e-commerce, internet, and online education sectors over the past year. All of those challenges generated fierce headwinds and caused Tencent's growth to slow to a crawl throughout 2022:Metric Q4 2021 Q1 2022 Q2 2022 Q3 2022 Q4 2022 VAS revenue growth (YOY) 7% 0% 0% (3%) (2%) Fintech and business services revenue growth (YOY) 25% 10% 1% 4% (1%) Online advertising revenue growth (YOY) (13%) (18%) (18%) (5%) 15% Total revenue growth (YOY) 8% 0% (3%) (2%) 0.5%Are brighter days ahead?As Tencent's growth decelerated, it aggressively cut costs to boost its profits. As a result, its adjusted operating margin rose four percentage points year over year (but still dipped two percentage points sequentially) to 27% in the fourth quarter. For the full year, its adjusted operating margin stayed roughly flat at 28%.Tencent's revenue growth should accelerate again as China ends its zero-COVID restrictions, approves more games, and eases its crackdowns on private companies. That's why analysts expect its revenue to rise 11% in 2023 and 12% in 2024. Its reported net income is expected to decline 25% in 2023 (due to its divestment of Meituan in 2022) and rise 16% in 2024.Based on those expectations, Tencent looks reasonably valued at 23 times forward earnings. But it's also a Chinese stock that still faces delisting threats in the U.S. At the same multiple, it's easy to find non-Chinese tech stocks that are growing at similar rates and face fewer macro, regulatory, and competitive challenges. Therefore, I expect Tencent's stock to trade sideways this year until those headwinds fully dissipate and Chinese stocks look like worthwhile investments again.",

            "description": "Tencent has made significant progress in its environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance over the past year. In the 2022 ESG Report published this week, the company comprehensively lays out its initiatives including its carbon neutrality and biodiversity efforts, efforts to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), the advancement of sustainable social value innovation.Tencent is guided by our vision to use \u2018Tech for Good\u2019. In 2022, the company remained focused on improving its ESG performance while starting to add social value creation in the balanced scorecard to evaluate overall business performance.\u201cTransforming our care for the people into products that can solve social pain points is, in a nutshell, how we implement our sustainable social value innovation strategy,\u201d said Pony Ma, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Tencent.On the same note, Martin Lau, President of Tencent also highlights, \u201cWe need to discover the pain points, then use the capabilities of our products and technologies to find innovative pathways to address them. During this process, we take our corporate social responsibility as the baseline to assess if our products have created unique user value, and if we have upheld our ethical values along the way.\u201dEnvironment: Pathway to Carbon Neutrality by 2030Tencent has pledged to achieve carbon neutrality in its own operations and across its supply chain by 2030, at which time, it plans to be powered 100 percent by green energy.The company\u2019s decarbonization roadmap puts emissions reduction and renewable energy as priorities, supplemented by carbon offset technologies and mechanisms. Based on our commitment to carbon neutrality, we have refined our decarbonisation pathway targets and set absolute greenhouse emissions reduction targets in alignment with the Paris Agreement. The avoidance of 241,952.9 tonnes of carbon emissions was achieved with the purchase of 336,419.5 MWh of green energy in the past year. In addition, Tencent continues to support the development of next-generation low-carbon technologies, launching its flagship CarbonX Program in March 2023 and the TanLive platform in December 2022.To strengthen the management of nature-related risks and opportunities, Tencent published a Biodiversity Statement that outlines its strategy and approach to develop its business in an eco-friendly way. It committed to reducing dependence on natural resources, and is working to protect ecosystems and rare species.Social: Tackling Social Pain Points and Driving Positive ChangeTencent is focused on leveraging its core capabilities to tackle social pain points and driving positive change.AI technology is enhancing accessibility and bringing a higher quality of life to people with physical limitations. With the launch of the \u201cBarrier-Free First Aid\u201d feature, which uses speech recognition technology to enable text-to-speech and speech-to-text conversion, we were able to assist people with hearing impairments in seeking help independently and efficiently. Our MTGPA Haptics solution supports the elderly and visually impaired to navigate indoor and outdoor spaces through vibration prompts on their smartphones.Smart technology is helping to boost operational efficiency and introduce high-precision solutions in the transport, medical and healthcare, manufacturing, and other sectors. Furthermore, gaming technologies are applied to the construction of highly-simulated internet-based factories, digital technology is opening new frontiers in virtual tourism, and AI-driven technologies are used to the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), nicknamed Sky Eye, to find pulsars.Driving \"sustainable social value innovation\" remains an important cornerstone for Tencent, as it builds on pillars such as research in basic sciences, education innovation, assisting with public emergencies and philanthropy platform.In its 2022 efforts, the company\u2019s Future Scientist Programme sponsored 20 groups of outstanding secondary school students to receive personal guidance from renowned scientists and developed an open emergency response platform to help first aiders quickly locate the nearest AED. In addition, we launched a new interactive feature called \u201cOne Flower, One Dream\u201d to encourage greater participation in charitable activities. Tencent's annual public charity campaign, \"99 Giving Day\", drew more than 100 million participants who contributed RMB3.3 billion in 2022, with proceeds helping the vulnerable and disadvantaged in society.How to better support women\u2019s development in different professions and positions has been a challenge faced by various industries, including the tech sector. Tencent has been committed to strengthening the integration of DEI into the workplace. In the past year, the company has enhanced its efforts in this area by releasing its Commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and establishing a DEI special committee under the ESG Working Group.Tencent has committed to steadily increase diversity at the company, and has put human resource management processes, mechanisms, and employee awareness programs in place to cultivate a fairer, more open and inclusive environment. Of note, the ongoing Women Impact Tech Conference is held to encourage more women to actively participate in industry developments and pursue personal career advancements.Governance: Increasing Board Diversity and Strengthening ESG GovernanceWe are committed to increasing board diversity and strengthening our ESG governance to ensure sustainable development in the long-term.Tencent updated its Board Diversity Policy in March 2022. In the selection of directors, the Policy comprehensively considers diversity factors, including but not limited to industry knowledge, professional background, experience, gender, and race.In 2022, Professor Zhang Xiulan joined the Board as an independent non-executive director, bringing her unique perspectives, rich industry experience and professional insights to the company. The proportion of female directors on the board is expected to reach 25 percent after May 2023. The Board intends to increase the proportion of female directors to 30 percent by 2030.To promote internal collaboration and performance management of key ESG topics, five special committees have been set up under the ESG Working Group. The five committees oversee the areas of user privacy and data security; diversity, equity and inclusion; supply chain management; biodiversity conservation; and ESG communications.Tencent has been proactively managing the balance between commercial value, social value and shareholder value. We remain committed to leveraging our core strengths and collaborating with all stakeholders to create long-lasting impact that serves the people and society.Learn more about Tencent\u2019s ESG efforts in its 2022 ESG Report.",

            "description": "Quantum computers have the potential to carry out highly complicated calculations in minutes that would have taken classical computers thousands of years to work out. But much of the industry is still in its infancy, partly because of a lack of domain experts and software tools that match the progress of quantum hardware.Now, companies are working to simplify the process of developing quantum software applications so programmers don\u2019t actually need to understand the underlying quantum mechanics. One of the early-stage startups making such an effort is Singapore-based Horizon Quantum Computing, whose tools can automatically construct quantum algorithms based on programs written in classical programming languages.The company recently picked up $18.1 million in a Series A round from Tencent along with other investors, boosting its equity financing to around $21.3 million. Other investors in the Series A round included Sequoia Capital India, SGInnovate, Pappas Capital and Expeditions Fund.The money will be used to fund product development and its expansion in Europe, where the company is planning to open an office in Dublin, Ireland. The startup is also scheduled to launch the early access program of its developer tools later this year.While Singapore is more widely known as a financial hub, it has also been one of the most proactive governments in supporting quantum technologies. The Center for Quantum Technologies, where Horizon Quantum Computing\u2019s founder and CEO Joe Fitzsimons used to be a professor, was set up under the city-state\u2019s Research Centres of Excellence program to advance research in the cutting-edge field.\u201cWhen I made the jump from academia, Singapore already had the right talent [for quantum computing] and there was access to capital,\u201d said Fitzsimons, who earned a PhD from University of Oxford.Friendly groundSingapore is also less likely to impose export restrictions on technologies, reckoned the founder, who said he doesn\u2019t want his company to be barred from selling in other markets like the European Union.Being in a politically neutral country like Singapore is increasingly important in a world where businesses become caught in the tech war between the U.S. and China and lose access to supply chains. Launching from a neutral home base is now seen as a prerequisite for many tech firms, including quantum computer builders, who rely on components sourced from around the world.Tencent\u2019s investment in Horizon Quantum Computing is purely financial, so it won\u2019t entail any transfer of sensitive data, the founder noted. The startup took Tencent\u2019s investment because the giant is an \u201cexpert\u201d in the area, he said.Indeed, the social networking and gaming giant showed a keen interest in the field when it opened its quantum research lab in 2018. Ling Ge, Tencent\u2019s chief representative in Europe and the person who oversaw the deal with Horizon Quantum Computing, has known Fitzsimons since her years in Oxford, where she studied quantum computing.\u201cAt Tencent, we take a long-term perspective on quantum. In our own quantum lab, we are focused on fundamental research, first-principles simulations and quantum algorithms, and how these might serve enterprise customers,\u201d said Ge at an industry event last year.\u201cIn terms of investments, we take a science-driven approach. One of the challenges in investing in quantum is what we call the \u2018black box\u2019 paradox. The challenge of evaluating early-stage deep tech companies in areas like quantum, nuclear fusion or biotech is difficult because the core technology is in its early proof-of-concept phase. It is hard to evaluate and understand at what stage of maturity it really is.\u201cTherefore, we take appropriate steps to mitigate the risks of this black box paradox depending on the investment stage. This is primarily achieved through our deep technical expertise, which allows us to really understand what is being developed and its maturity,\u201d she said.The story was updated on April 3, 2023 to clarify the founder\u2019s view on export controls.",

            "description": "Dowson Tong, Tencent\u2019s Senior Executive Vice President and CEO of Tencent Cloud and Smart Industries Group, recently spoke at the Boao Forum for Asia on the future of the Internet and its trends. Tong outlined three major trends that will shape the next generation of the Internet: AI-driven, immersive and integration with industries.He emphasized that artificial intelligence (AI) will become the core driver of the Internet, with machines providing content and even services, changing its supply and demand relationship.Dowson Tong shared views about the next-generation internet at the Boao Forum for Asia, March 30.Tong thinks that AI will significantly enhance work efficiency and accelerate the development of cloud computing. He noted that large-scale AI models require high computing power and high-speed connection. Therefore, the application of AI requires the cloud as a carrier to be \"plug-and-play.\" Thus, the integration of AI and cloud will have a major impact on the cloud's growth potential and development model.AI as Core Driver for the Next Generation of Internet\"AIGC will enhance productivity and transform the Internet's supply and demand relationship. In the past, people were the main providers of Internet content and services, but machines may become providers in the future,\" Tong said in his speech.In addition to AI-driven, Tong also mentioned that the Immersive Convergence, which was introduced by Tencent in 2022, is another trend of the future Internet. The information of the Internet has evolved from graphics and text to three-dimensional representation of the real world, enabling two-way interactions and operations between the virtual and real worlds.As an example, Tencent Cloud and Sany Group jointly launched an unmanned mine truck, allowing truck drivers to sit in a comfortable office and operate unmanned mine trucks through the screen. This was made possible by the integration of Tencent Cloud's real-time audio and video technology and 5G network, which effectively copes with weak network conditions and reduces video transmission delays from seconds to less than 100 milliseconds. This ensures smooth, stable, and reliable remote control.The next-generation Internet is becoming even more deeply integrated into industries. Companies in the value chain, from design and production to marketing, are increasing the use of the Internet to enhance output and efficiency.Cloud Development Accelerated by AITong believes that AI technology will greatly enhance production efficiency.One example is the 3D virtual scene automatic generation solution developed by Tencent AI Lab. Showcased at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco last month, the solution uses AIGC technology to create lifelike, diverse virtual city scenes in a very short period of time from scratch. The \"city\" covers 25 square kilometers where 4,000 buildings locate and 130-kilometer roads run. The construction of such a large-scale city usually took several artists a few years, but it now takes only a few weeks with the aid of AI.Furthermore, Tong pointed out that the development of AI is beneficial for the development of the cloud.The cloud infrastructure can provide high computing power that's essential for AI model training. As a result, AI technology will accelerate the use and popularity of the cloud.The next-generation Internet can largely enhance production efficiency, making it quickly applied to various industries and enterprises. At the same time, AI technology requires the cloud as a carrier to be \"plug-and-play\", which will increase the cloud's penetration. In the future, more industries will transition to the cloud, and more people will use it.Tencent's Hunyuan AI large model has covered natural language processing, computer vision, multimodality, and many industry and domain models. It has also improved ad recommendation accuracy in Tencent's own products and services.The integration of AI and cloud will enable faster and more efficient production. The future of the internet is exciting, and we can expect to see transformative changes in the coming years.",

            "description": "Concern over E3 2023's future is continung to grow, prompting more publishers to drop out behind Nintendo, Xbox, Sony , and Ubisoft . IGN has learned that Sega and Tencent will be skipping E3 2023 amid rumors that the promised triumphant return of gaming\u2019s biggest event may not happen after all.IGN reporters have spoken with numerous individuals in publishing and PR who typically have knowledge of event strategies, all of whom expressed concern about the status of this summer\u2019s event. Many told us that they hadn\u2019t heard of anyone else who was planning to attend for sure, and some said they felt there had been a significant lack of communication from the ESA and organizer ReedPop as to what exactly they should expect from the show. Several described the situation as one where everyone was waiting for someone else to be the first to jump, but no one was willing to take the leap \u2013 and time was running out.As one knowledgeable source put it ahead of the Monday news of Ubisoft\u2019s departure from the show, \u201cThere\u2019s no possible way this show can happen.\u201dNeither ESA nor ReedPop responded to IGN's request for comment in time for publication.Panic! on the Show FloorWhat was most striking around these conversations was the sheer confusion. Several told us that in past years when E3 had taken place, they recalled already having all their plans firmly in place by this time in March, some even publicly announcing this early ( a quick glance at recent past E3 news announcements confirms this ).But not so in 2023. Multiple people broached the question of E3 with us throughout the conference even before we asked, seemingly desperate for information that could help them make informed decisions about whether or not they should be allocating large budgets for a show floor booth and the personnel to staff it in just two months\u2019 time. Many questioned whether they should skip the show itself but still make an appearance in town to meet off-site with media who might be around that week.\u201c \u201cThere\u2019s no possible way this show can happen.\u201dIn contrast to the deep concerns around E3, feelings were mixed to positive about Geoff Keighley\u2019s Play Days \u2013 an in-person, media-only event that last year took place over two days in early June around the same time as E3 and which has been confirmed again for this year. Several people we spoke to confirmed they had games locked in for Play Days, and a few mentioned they expected more games to be present this year than last year.That said, the event is still significantly smaller than E3 has been historically, and as opposed to its first run in 2022, may not be composed almost entirely of hands-on demos.Loading PlayIGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! Welcome to 20 questions. Can you guess the game?Even without the historical baggage of E3, it's unsurprising so many publishers are hesitant to make grand appearances at a summer event of any kind. The COVID-19 pandemic violently disrupted production, announcement, and release cycles, and for several years in a row removed the urgency of having a polished game demo ready for hands-on at a big summer event.Budgets, too, are reportedly in limbo. Lockdowns in 2020 and 2021 prompted companies to significantly slash funds for events while laying off their events teams, with sources through the industry telling IGN that many publishers have yet to replenish to pre-2020 levels. Even if companies wanted to come to E3, or Play Days, or just LA in general, many aren\u2019t financially prepared for all the expenses that entails \u2013 or if they are, they\u2019re spending that money on events that have fewer questions about their stability, such as PAX or Gamescom.This perhaps explains why so few companies are willing to play ball despite sources telling IGN that numerous publishers collaborated with ReedPop on defining exactly what they wanted out of E3\u2019s 2023 rendition. Their initial participation and subsequent reluctance has led to a sense of betrayal within ReedPop, which has been tasked with bringing the gaming event back from the grave, with those involved feeling they were left to shoulder the blame for the ESA\u2019s past mistakes and publishers\u2019 present day fears.What\u2019s more, ReedPop is preparing for further internal shakeup next month. Per an email to staff, as seen by IGN, Lance Fensterman, the company's president for the last 14 years, is preparing to step down, leaving current VP and ReedPop veteran since 2004 Michael Kisken to fill his shoes. [Disclosure: Both authors of this article are former ReedPop employees through its editorial arm, Gamer Network].Who's in? Who's out?IGN reached out to a number of major publishers ahead of publication to ask if they were able to confirm E3 attendance this year; or, where applicable, their plans for satellite events around E3. Those that did not respond in time for publication included EA, Square Enix, Embracer Group, Activision Blizzard, Epic Games, Take-Two, and Warner Bros. Games. IGN understands that more publishers plan to skip E3, but that they have yet to make a formal announcement.Of those that did respond, Sega confirmed to IGN that it would not be attending the show after all, saying in a statement, \"After careful consideration, we have decided not to participate in E3 2023 as an exhibitor. We look forward to sharing more information on announced and unannounced projects in the future.\"Bandai Namco declined to provide an update on E3, but did confirm it would be attending Play Days. Tencent confirmed through a spokesperson that Level Infinite would not be attending E3 2023, but that it had participated in Play Days in 2022 and \u201cfound it to be an ideal experience for showcasing our games to the media.\u201dDevolver Digital, which has historically never officially attended E3 but has multiple years running set up shot in an adjacent parking lot, provided the following:While we always root for the success of any industry gathering that promotes great games, we have never officially attended E3 and do not plan to do so this year unfortunately. We will also confirm we will not be hosting satellite events this year in Los Angeles, but look forward to returning to our beloved parking lot to do so if the opportunity arises for a future LACC-based event. We are happy to report that we are well underway in the production of our annual Devolver Direct scheduled for June which we will share news about soon.With only two months to go before E3 2023 is scheduled in Los Angeles, the mood surrounding the show is a far cry from previous years. At a time when companies would normally be preparing to announce their major showcases and businesspeople, media, and the public would be booking travel, instead there is a pervasive question as to whether or not the show will happen at all. And if it does, those responsible for participating fear they may find themselves shackled to an expensive husk of a show as the rest of the industry moves on.Additional reporting by Kat Bailey.Rebekah Valentine is a news reporter for IGN.

            "description": "The signs that this year\u2019s E3 may be doomed, or at the very least, limping forward in a very-reduced capacity, continue to mount. After years of COVID-inflicted cancellations and half-measures, E3 was supposed to return this year courtesy of PAX producer ReedPop, but the new organizers haven\u2019t been able to attract the most important thing for a successful E3 \u2013 publishers willing to show off their latest games. Yesterday, we heard that Ubisoft, one of the few major publishers to commit to the new E3, was pulling out, and now more no-shows have been confirmed.According to a new article from IGN, Sega, Tencent\u2019s Level Infinite label, and Devolver Digital won\u2019t be at the show (technically, Devolver never officially attended E3, setting up shop across the street instead, but this year they\u2019re not even doing that). Other publishers, including EA, Square Enix, Activision Blizzard, and Epic Games declined to comment on whether they\u2019d be attending the show.

Stay tuned for more details! pic.twitter.com/2qlZJKdCzl \u2014 Summer Game Fest - Live June 8! (@summergamefest) March 28, 2023So, is E3 doomed? While I\u2019m not counting out a last-minute turnaround, it certainly feels like it. This is around the time when behind-the-scenes planning for E3 would usually begin, and there hasn\u2019t been a peep from anybody. As a journalist, I can tell you, we have not returned to E3 season as usual. We\u2019ll see what happens, but I\u2019m not overly optimistic.In theory, E3 is scheduled to run from June 13 to June 16 this year. Meanwhile, as mentioned above, Summer Game Fest kicks off on June 8 and will likely encompass multiple events throughout the summer. Take your bets, Wccftech comments section \u2013 does E3 actually happen this year or not?",

            "description": "The latest report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlighted that the world is not on track to limit temperature rises. For a 50 percent chance of capping global warming at 1.5\u00b0C, the IPCC says the world needs to halve carbon dioxide emissions within 10 years.While a clean energy transition is underway, we need a diverse mix of green and low-carbon technologies to work together, among which carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technology has emerged as one of the key tools that will support a greener economy.To this end, Tencent launched its flagship \u201cCarbonX Program\u201d on March 23. The program aims to encourage and support development of next generation low-carbon technologies. It will also promote the large-scale application of such cutting-edge technologies by 2030. The first phase of the program focuses on carbon capture, utilization and storage.Technology innovation is a \u201ckey variable\u201d to accelerate the carbon neutrality. We need promote the industrialization and scale of the cutting-edge low-carbon technologies so that they can play a bigger role in shaping greener economy.Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage as a SolutionCCUS is not new. Having been in development for decades, it is the technology of stripping or capturing carbon dioxide emitted in industrial processes before, or even after, it enters the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is then injected into geological formations for long-term storage deep underground or converted into commercially viable products such as chemicals, fuels, cements, and plastics.Emerging low-carbon technologies such as carbon capture, utilization and storage will be essential to realize carbon neutrality in the future, but they need to be supported in their early stages in the same way solar and wind power were.While CCUS is technologically complex and costly, ongoing development is being done to scale up its application and improve market viability. Both private and public sectors around the world are investing resources to develop CCUS with the goal of deploying it at a commercial scale.Tencent is keen to contribute to the development of this technology. We will use our expertise to accelerate cutting-edge solutions to combat climate change as part of our commitment to becoming carbon neutral in our operations and throughout our supply chain by 2030.We appreciate the importance of CCUS in reaching carbon neutrality, and we are working with Carbfix, an Icelandic technology that turns carbon dioxide into stone, to widen its application in our operations. Now, we are excited to launch the CarbonX Program in collaboration with our partners who share the same vision for CCUS.How \u201cCarbonX\u201d WorksThe CarbonX Program is a combined accelerator and digital capability building program dedicated to exploring next-generation low carbon technologies and promoting the large-scale application of these technologies by 2030 with catalytic funds and resources. During its initial phase, the program will focus on CCUS solutions and projects.The program is underpinned by three pillars. Universities, institutions, NGOs and startups are invited to submit business proposals.CarbonX Lab : Identify and incubate potential research institutions, universities, or labs that leverage new technology to introduce game-changing climate change solutions; help them launch their pilot projects for industry demonstration.CarbonX Accelerator : Accelerate the growth of startups that exhibit commercialization potential.CarbonX Infrastructure: Support the establishment of infrastructure (such as databases and carbon sequestration monitoring tools) to facilitate industry development.As stated by the United Nations, the window of opportunity to keep 1.5\u00b0C is closing rapidly. We are committed to using our skills, expertise, and resources to further contribute to solving this global challenge.",

            "description": "Women Impact Tech is a US-based event series that empowers top female leaders and engineers in the industry to make a bigger impact and advance equity in tech. Michelle Liu, CEO of Tencent Games Global, was a keynote speaker at the latest conference in San Francisco on 21 March. As a 20-plus-year veteran of the gaming industry, she spoke about how Games as a Service (GaaS) has transformed the sector, allowing developers and gamers to break through technological, geographical, and social barriers, all the while digitally connecting with others.Below is an excerpt from her speech, which has been edited for brevity.The Rise of GaaS in the Digital EraWe are living in a digital age. Most of our gamers are digital natives. Since they are constantly looking for authentic and unique ways to express themselves and connect with others, games can no longer be close-ended, one-off, fixed experiences.GaaS has become the best avenue for gamers who seek to immerse themselves in virtual worlds. Also known as live-service games, GaaS refers to games that are frequently updated with new content and experiences, often through subscriptions or in-game purchases. Over the years, the model has matured enough to attract and retain gamers not just for the entertainment value, but also for its social benefits.Unlocking the PotentialGaaS offers three significant benefits for both players and the gaming industry:1. The low-cost and mobile-first approach of GaaS removes barriers for people who otherwise might not have become gamers. Many aspects of GaaS are designed to make gaming more accessible, offering the convenience of cross-platform playability wherever you are, on whatever device you have.2. GaaS has changed the way players engage in games, from static and fixed experiences to being open-ended, modifiable, with dynamic narratives and constantly updated content. Gamers are openly encouraged to create user-generated content (UGC), which gives them a chance to express themselves and personalize their gaming experience. Because of GaaS and UGC, studios and gamers help each other to create a better community.3. GaaS facilitates social interaction. Live-service games have online social features such as leaderboards, live chats, guilds and more. These encourage players from all over the world to connect, communicate, and share ideas.Appealing to Both GendersAt Tencent Games, GaaS is part of our DNA. We have published some of the most-successful live-service titles such as PUBG Mobile and Honor of Kings.Honor of Kings (HOK) is an online battle arena mobile game (MOBA) developed by TiMi Studios way back in 2015. It\u2019s the world\u2019s most popular MOBA game, which not only helped popularize the genre in China, but also breaks the stereotype of games being for men only. In fact, the number and percentage of women players have, at times, outnumbered those of men, according to third-party data.This success is largely down to HOK\u2019s format and theme which have been specifically designed for mobile gaming. It offers simpler controls, smaller maps and shorter sessions than other popular MOBA games on other platforms. In addition, HOK features modern interpretations of heroes from Chinese mythology and folklore. Once we saw HOK\u2019s potential to attract female players, we tailored our approach and rolled out a series of updates, special events, and e-sports programs targeting women. Since 2015, over 120 million women have joined our HOK community.Let's Get RealThe gaming industry has always been active in the application, popularization, and promotion of cutting-edge technology. In line with our mission of Tech for Good, Tencent Games also actively develops games for social good by working with the scientific, educational and cultural sectors. We have already developed games like Blue Bridge Caf\u00e9, which educates users about HIV prevention and control; Tumor Doctor, where users can learn about tumors; and Seeing, which helps people understand the challenges blind people face.At Tencent, we believe the \u201cservice\u201d model of GaaS can fuse with real-world applications that benefit society and drive real-world innovations.For example, governments and organizations worldwide have grappled with how best to preserve cultural heritage while making fragile sites and landmarks accessible. As part of this, there is an increase in the importance of the digitization and digitalization of heritage sites, made possible by game technologies.Tencent is committed to supporting such cultural protection projects. Our most recent initiative is the digital restoration of the Great Wall in China, where we assisted in its protection and restoration by building the digital Great Wall of China through the use of game technologies including Programmed Content Generation technology, Cloud Gaming, and Virtual Avatars. These technologies bring cultural heritage to life through vivid stories, allowing the public to better understand the history and culture in a compelling way.GaaS is about getting closer to players and making games accessible. As a CEO, a mother and a game player, I will continue to work to bring immersive, self-expressive, barrier-free gaming experiences for all players, and use games as a vehicle to make a positive impact on society.",

It is now too big to be a growth stock darling and too widely-spread to escape the gravity of China\u2019s underlying economic trends.Revenues in calendar 2022 flatlined at RMB554 billion, while net profits dropped 16% to RMB188.2 billion ($27.0 billion).The decrease reflected China\u2019s economic reversal that began in the second quarter of the year with the arrival of a new COVID strain and stricter government measures to combat it. Tencent\u2019s advertising revenues fell slightly, costs rose somewhat, and subscriber number were mixed \u2013 rising in music, but falling in video.The once lionized company propped up its appeal to investors with nearly $2 billion of share repurchases, a dividend that is to be hiked by 50% and the giveaway of its shareholding in shopping firm Meituan.There are promises too of better things to come following the endurance test that was 2022.\u201cDuring 2022, we increased our business efficiency, sharpened our focus on core activities, and developed new services and revenue lines including \u2018video accounts\u2019 [a sub-app serving ads alongside video content within the WeChat social media app] and international games. These changes position us to benefit from, and contribute to, a rebound in China economic growth which our users\u2019 activity suggests is now underway,\u201d said chairman Pony Ma Huateng.\u201cWe are investing in our AI capabilities and cloud infrastructure to embrace foundation models, which we believe will enhance the experience of our existing products and services and allow us to explore introducing new products. Looking forward, we will continue to seek creating user value, commercial value and social value via technology and innovation.\u201dThe fourth quarter, when the Chinese economy began to re-emerge from its COVID fug, was also better for Tencent. Advertising revenues from Tencent\u2019s different sectors increased between 4% and 17% on an annual basis in the last three months of the year. The quarter was also strong for Tencent\u2019s international games business, where revenues grew by 11% on a like-for-like basis, driven by key franchises \u201cValorant\u201d and \u201cLeague of Legends\u201d and new launches of \u201cGoddess of Victory: Nikke\u201d and \u201cWarhammer 40,000: Darktide.\u201dThere was continuing weakness in the huge Chinese games business, where regulators had delayed issuing new games licenses and intervened to cut the hours of gameplay by under-18s.\u201cIn 2022, we significantly reduced minor time spent through the implementation of our industry-leading minor protection program. However, we have sustained our market leadership, with \u2018Honour of Kings\u2019 resuming year-on-year growth in daily active users (DAU) in the fourth quarter of 2022 and achieving record-high gross receipts during the Chinese New Year holiday in 2023. In February 2023, we tapped into the survival-open world-crafting game genre, through the release of our self-developed \u2018Undawn\u2019,\u201d the company said.Tencent\u2019s subscription businesses trod water. In music (reported on Wednesday under the Tencent Music Entertainment banner) there was a business readjustment that drove up subscriber numbers and reduced those using free tiers and a shift that also saw music streaming outpace social entertainment functionality.Tencent\u2019s streaming video business pushed up prices but lost subscribers, which it blamed on content delays. With 119 million video subscribers Tencent Video remains the SVOD market leader in China, but the gap to rival iQiyi, which recently claimed 110 million paying subscribers, has narrowed over the last year.Tencent said overall \u201cfee-based value-added-service subscriptions decreased 1% year-on-year to 234 million\u201d and that in the fourth quarter \u201cmobile games VAS revenues (including mobile games revenues attributable to social networks business) decreased by 2% year-on-year to RMB39.2 billion, while PC client games revenues increased by 8% year-on-year to RMB11.5 billion.\u201dMa\u2019s optimism for the current year is based upon examples such as the \u201cUndawn\u201d game, a record-breaking January launch for self-commissioned TV drama series \u201cThree-Body,\u201d which became the highest-rated Chinese science fiction series released in China in the past five years, and booming advertising during January\u2019s Lunar New Year holidays.And while, it was not mentioned directly in the regulatory filings, the company is likely counting on the end of regulatory tightening after a two-year cycle of anti-tech crackdowns on multiple fronts.

            "description": "HONG KONG, March 22 (Reuters) - Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) on Thursday said it would restrict its focus to its core business, while maintinaing cost-cutting and improving efficiencies, as it reported its first drop in annual revenue to date.The world's largest video game company and operator of the WeChat messaging platform posted revenue of 554.55 billion yuan ($81 billion) for 2022, down 1% from a year earlier, after China's economic slowdown due to the pandemic and a long-running regulatory crackdown dented profits.Analysts on average had expected 555.15 billion yuan, according to Refinitiv.Profit attributable to equity holders fell 16% to 188.24 billion yuan for the year versus a consensus estimate of 114.19 billion yuan.Tencent Chair and CEO Pony Ma told reporters on a call the company would focus this year on getting more out of existing core businesses, rather than on \"trying to do everything\" and on operating in \"red ocean markets\", where competition is intense.\"We hope that our entire business management team and technology will be more focused,\" he said. \"I think this is very important because we can see that focus and making breakthroughs are very key to overall development.\"The business outlook is uncertain in the world's largest gaming market after two years of regulatory crackdowns, but sector participants are hopeful of a recovery as regulators have resumed granting publishing licences since late last year after a months-long freeze.Unlike in most other countries, video games need approval from regulators before release in China.The crackdown has changed the operating environment for China's tech giants as regulators have tightened scrutiny over monopolistic behaviour and companies' handling of user information.Martin Lau, president of the company, told a later call with analysts that regulations are being normalised and support for platform companies should improve this year.A Tencent logo is seen in Beijing, China September 4, 2020. REUTERS/Tingshu Wang Acquire Licensing Rights\"[Chinese president Xi Jinping recently] mentioned supporting platform companies to show competence, creating employment, driving consumption and international competition,\" he said, \"The premier also highlighted the private sector would have a significant potential in the China economy.\"ADVERTISING BUSINESS PICKS UPHelping to offset the losses in domestic gaming and fintech, Tencent's online advertising business showed a surprisingly strong recovery in the fourth quarter, with revenue for the segment rising 15%, and contributing to a 1% rise in the group's revenue overall for the quarter ended December.China's city lockdowns intensified in the weeks to early December when the country abruptly ended its zero-COVID policy, unleashing a wave of infections, which heavily disrupted the economy and caused many deaths.Charlie Chai, an analyst with 86Research, said Tencent's performance as a whole was \"lukewarm\", but the advertising segment \"shrugged off the COVID challenge and delivered industry-beating growth\".During the media call, Lau also spoke about the company's forays into generative artificial intelligence, which has seen a surge in global interest, driven by the popularity of Microsoft-backed startup OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT.Reuters reported last month that Tencent was working on a ChatGPT-like chatbot named the \"HunyuanAide\" that will incorporate Tencent's Hunyuan AI model.Lau said the company was rapidly advancing its proprietary foundation model Hunyuan and planned to gradually roll out its own AI foundation models.Tencent's chief strategy officer James Mitchell said that Tencent was ready to bear the large cost associated with training AI models even though it is focused on cost-cutting in other areas.The United States in October announced export controls on high-end computer chips to China to try to contain AI development in the country, but Mitchell said Tencent has enough chips ready to develop its AI models.($1 = 6.8887 Chinese yuan)Reporting by Josh Ye; Editing by Himani Sarkar, Emelia Sithole-Matarise and Barbara LewisOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

REUTERS/Tingshu Wang/File Photo Acquire Licensing RightsHONG KONG, March 20 - China's online gaming regulator on Monday granted licences to 27 foreign games in March, including titles to be published by Tencent Holdings (0700.HK), NetEase Inc (9999.HK) and Bilibili Inc (9626.HK) .Among the imported online games approved by the National Press and Publication Administration is at least one by Tencent, a game called Merge Mansion, according to a list the regulator released on Monday. NetEase secured approval for at least one mobile game named Audition: Everybody Party, while Bilibili received a licence for a game called Shanyao! Youjunshaonu.This marks the second batch of foreign online games to receive publishing licences in China recently, just three months after the regulator approved the first batch in December. The crackdown by China on online gaming had halted the approval process for foreign video games for 18 months between 2021 and 2022.The approval of imported games last December marked the end of China's crackdown on the video game industry which began in August in 2021 when regulators suspended the game approval process. Regulators first resumed issuing game licences to homegrown games in April 2022.XD Inc (2400.HK) received licences for two mobile games named Gorogoa and Wizard of Legend respectively. Other notable titles approved by China via this batch include a mobile game called Fairy Tale: Fighting and a console game named Yo-kai Watch 4.Reporting by Josh Ye, Editing by Louise Heavens and Bernadette BaumOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "description": "Metacore\u2019s hit game, Merge Mansion, will be going East as the game has been approved for release in China and will be published by game giant Tencent.The news comes as part of a raft of new licences being granted, allowing domestic and foreign titles to be released in China. This is the second wave of new licences since the lifting of domestic crackdowns on tech companies, which included freezing the granting of said licences. The news is being hailed by some as a return to normality and a positive sign for the future. This wave of licences includes a variety of domestic and foreign titles on a variety of platforms such as the aforementioned Merge Mansion, Japanese console title Yo-Kai Watch 4 and Netease\u2019s Audition: Everybody Party.The gaming licence freeze was a major hit for the formerly dominant Chinese games industry, where a near total halt to video game licences, required for sale and publishing in China, was called. The government cracking down on what they termed \u201cYouth Video Game Addiction\u201d, the knock-on effects of pandemic restrictions and a wider tech crackdown saw the Chinese game market forecast for its first recession in decades. However, a sudden reversal saw an initial wave of new titles approved for launch, with this second wave hopefully indicating a change in course for the treatment of the games industry in China.Changing of tidesThe shift in fortunes for the Chinese market is notable, as many may have seen a potential gap to muscle in on the territory of giants like Tencent and Netease. However, it seems that the freeze is now going to be followed by a glut of new games. Whether that will oversaturate the market or feeds a hungry audience will become clear by the end of the year.The move is definitely a win for Metacore, who have been investing heavily into Merge Mansion with a new star-studded ad campaign featuring Hollywood star Pedro Pascal. Breaking into the Chinese market will expose their game to a whole new audience, and given the popularity of Merge Mansion internationally it\u2019s likely that it will find a similarly loyal following in China.",

Devsisters Corp, whose hit game \u201cCookie Run\u201d was also on the NPPA\u2019s list, soared 15%. Nexon Games, whose popular \u201cBlue Archives\u201d and \u201cMapleStory\u201d were given the greenlight, surged 16%.In Hong Kong, Bilibili was up as much as 9.1%. It last jumped 5.4%. XD advanced 2.8%. iDreamSky Technology was up 3.2%.\u201cWe believe this implies a more supportive regulatory policy towards foreign titles that further support a healthier and normalized development of online gaming industry going forward,\u201d said Citi analysts on Tuesday.\u201cWe expect there could be two to three more imported batches in 2023, bringing total imported titles to 100 to 120.\u201dThe NPPA\u2019s move came two months after the iconic \u201cWorld of Warcraft\u201d franchise went offline in mainland China, after US publisher Blizzard and its Chinese distributor NetEase broke off talks to extend their 14-year partnership. That left many Chinese players devastated.The regulator suspended licensing for all video games for nine months from July 2021 to April 2022, as the government launched a far-reaching tech crackdown and introduced stringent measures to cap playing times for minors in order to curb extreme cases of gaming addiction.The NPPA lifted the freeze on domestic titles last April, in a sign that Beijing\u2019s crackdown on the tech sector was easing. But foreign games were still unable to access the Chinese market until December, when the regulator finally approved 45 foreign titles, including \u201cPok\u00e9mon Unite\u201d by Nintendo and \u201cValorant\u201d by Riot Games.",

            "description": "The variety of life on our planet is in severe decline. According to a 2020 World Wildlife Fund (WWF) report, monitored wildlife populations fell 69 percent between 1970 and 2018. This shocking loss of biodiversity in less than 50 years puts our world and its 8 billion human inhabitants at a level of risk comparable to the impact of global climate change.In fact, the two threats are clearly interlinked, since climate change, land-clearing, over-grazing, over-fishing and deforestation are among the leading causes of habitat loss and declining biodiversity.The loss of biodiversity has already been affecting the health and well-being of humans. Firstly, a diverse biosphere underpins our food supply. Millions of species have to interact in an interconnected ecosystem in order to make available the huge variety of food that we consume. A more biodiverse planet also gives us more species of plants and animals to source medicine from to fight diseases. Biodiversity also provides many jobs globally and benefits businesses which rely on natural resources. Finally, protecting, respecting and preserving the variety of life on the planet is simply the right thing to do for the future of our planet and for humanity.Transitioning to a Better ModelBiodiversity loss is an unprecedented challenge that demands collective action from communities worldwide. There is a pressing need to safeguard biodiversity in across the world including in China, a home to more than 30,000 plant and 6,300 animal species, many of which are currently under threat.In order to tackle the issue of biodiversity loss, technology companies have harnessed innovative solutions to address complex environmental challenges. Policymakers also made an ambitious pledge at the United Nations Biodiversity Conference (COP 15) to conserve 30 percent of the world\u2019s land and oceans by 2030.Tencent believes in the potential of leveraging technology to help tackle the challenge of biodiversity. We recently unveiled our strategy and approach towards biodiversity, detailing how we leverage the power of the internet to protect nature.In December, we attended COP 15 to talk about how we are using leading-edge internet technology to improve biodiversity. For example:Working with the WWF, Tencent launched a digital detection platform to track snow leopards and collect essential data to protect their shrinking habitat in China. Snow leopards are listed as \u201cvulnerable\u201d and there may be as few as 4,000 left on the planet, primarily in China. The Tencent platform conducts data analysis and generates visualized results that show the number, location and activity of snow leopards to help rangers and environmental specialists to develop protection strategies.The illegal wildlife trade has had a devastating impact on global biodiversity. To help curb the illegal trading of wildlife online, Tencent launched a new platform for people to report suspicious activity related to the buying and selling of illegal wildlife. The platform received around 10,000 reports from concerned citizens in just one year and Tencent has helped crack down on several illegal trading networks involving pangolins, ivory, Tibetan antelope horns, rhino horns and tiger bone worth more than RMB30 million. Tencent has also shared our success in combating criminal networks that profit from illegal wildlife trading with international organizations such as the Financial Action Task Force.The Manchurian tiger, or Siberian tiger, is an endangered species with as few as 4,000 left in the wild, mostly concentrated in Northern China. To save this majestic animal, China has set up several nature reserves in remote areas to restore the tigers\u2019 natural environment. To raise awareness of the tigers\u2019 plight and enable nature-lovers to observe them in their natural habitat, Tencent applied its immersive media compression technology to allow people to take a virtual tour of a nature reserve on their laptop or smartphone.As a leading Internet technology company, Tencent has used the power of the internet and technology to help address biodiversity challenges. Through our biodiversity initiatives and other sustainability programs, Tencent seeks to uphold its mission and vision, \"Value for Users, Tech for Good\", and take action to protect nature, enhance human well-being, and promote a sustainable and healthy planet.Read our Biodiversity Statement here: https://www.tencent.com/en-us/esg/environment/biodiversity-statement.html",

            "description": "The gender divide in the digital world is a great threat to economic and social inequalities. According to a report by UNICEF, gender inequality in the digital world has contributed to women being generally under-represented in the technology industry.To bring awareness to the issue of the digital gender gap, Tencent organized an online panel discussion on Wednesday, in line with this year\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day (IWD) theme \u201cDigitALL: Innovation and technology for gender equality.\u201dThree talented female leaders from the company shared their career experience in technology and described how they navigated challenges in a largely male-dominated industry. They also used the opportunity to address the issue and advocate for greater inclusion of women in the field.The event was latest efforts by the company, as one of the major employers in the global technology sector. The company has made continued progress in embracing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) as central to its value of upholding openness and fairness. The company has been working to create a more diverse and inclusive workplace for its employees, but recognizes there is still room for improvement.Webinar Link: Women in Tech: Perspectives, Visions, and TipsJia Wong, director of Data Science and Infrastructure Engineering at Tencent Americas, is a pioneer of digital transformation in the gaming industry.She devoted her entire career in gaming and is now using the experience to drive innovation in games for a better player experience.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say if I am in computer science because I was already talented, or I became good at it after all those years. What I know is that I never gave up. If I didn\u2019t understand something complicated, like algorithms, I would keep studying it until I got it. I carry this same attitude at work.\u201dJia is no stranger to the experience of being part of the minority as one of the female students studying software engineering at university. She has learned how to cope with it by focusing on herself and persevering through challenges with determination and resilience.\u201cWhat I realized is we (women) should not compare ourselves with other people. Evaluate your own progress by looking at the improvements you have made. Focus on your own progress. Everyone is unique and gifted \u2013 we just need to find our own strengths.\u201dHer colleague Rozita Tolouey could not agree more. \u201cA lot of the time I was the only woman in the room. I leverage my strength as a collaborator by actively listening and reading the room to facilitate the discussion,\u201d the head of business development and partnership marketing said.\u201cYoung women coming into the workforce should learn to develop grit at work. Build confidence in yourself when facing challenges and use that as an opportunity to learn about yourself and identify your strength.\u201dFor Tencent, the company recognizes the importance of bringing in more women into the talent pool. Doing so broadens perspectives, helping the company expand its products and services and tap into a wider user base.Christina Wang, HR Director of Tencent Games Global, considers bridging the gender gap as her personal mission. \u201cPromoting diversity, equity and inclusion is something I am very committed to personally. As one of the leaders in the industry, we need to work collectively with our peers to bridge the gender gap. Both men and women play equally important roles in driving innovation.\u201dThroughout the years, Tencent has implemented a range of activities to promote workplace equality. The company has provided diversity and inclusion trainings to educate employees about the importance and benefits of an inclusive workplace.The company has also created platforms to enable more female employees to speak up, such as organizing public forums and live discussion events that bring greater awareness about workplace equality. Nevertheless, women in general are still under-represented in the industry where only 26% of tech-related roles are filled by women. Clearly, there is work that remains to be done.\u201cDiscrimination is still a barrier for women to progress and we need to address that to empower more women to build their career in this industry. Women can offer a unique perspective in this fast-growing industry and we need to educate people to value that,\u201d Rozita said.\u201cWhile Tencent has taken steps to promote workplace equality, I recognize that it is critical for the senior leadership in all companies to prioritize this in their corporate strategy as well. By using a combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches, we can achieve more,\u201d said Christina.\u201cTo make meaningful changes, we need an action plan and a mechanism to monitor and track the progress we have made in achieving workplace equality,\u201d Jia added.The three panelists also agreed that there is also much that women have in their control to help themselves grow and achieve greater results professionally.Proactively building their own professional network is a start, for those who are early in their careers, according to the panelists.Setting a vision and learning their own tools to persevere in times of difficulties are also important to remain unwavering in their values and goals among naysayers.\u201cSet aside time to slow down and reflect on personal progress. With passion, a growth mindset, and the ability to look after your own mental and physical wellbeing, women will be well-equipped to progress in whatever career they choose,\u201d Christina said.Creating workplace equality requires a concerted effort by all stakeholders. It is a long-term goal that requires ongoing commitments. Companies that promote equality in the workplace stand to benefit not only themselves, but also contribute to a better future for all.",

Before, only those who hosted sessions with over 300 people had to pay.A monthly subscription costs CNY30 (USD4.40) per 25 participants, and users can host meetings up to a maximum of 500 people.Online conferencing became very popular during the Covid-19 pandemic and operators quickly gathered a huge number of customers. But how to retain these users, how to maintain their charging models as well as how to expand their footprint are common difficulties faced by both Internet giants and startups, a market analyst said.Many of these service providers, including Tencent Meeting, e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding\u2019s Ding Talk and TikTok operator ByteDance\u2019s Feishu, have put more emphasis on business revenue rather than market size in the post-pandemic era, the person said.Last March, Ding Talk started to charge smaller companies an annual fee of CNY9,800 (USD1,425) for its premium services, bigger firms a minimum of CNY100,000 (USD14,542) and industry giants CNY1 million.Editors: Zhang Yushuo, Kim Taylor",

The best-selling franchise definitely factors into Microsoft's buyout rationale--with over $31 billion in revenues and 425 million copies sold, it's impossible to ignore Call of Duty--however understanding this deal in its entirety requires higher-level optics. Microsoft wants to use Activision Blizzard King properties to disrupt the games industry on multiple levels. It's not about Xbox vs PlayStation, but Xbox vs all competitors, and ATVI games/services/content will give Microsoft an edge to take on mobile gaming's supposed duopolists Google and Apple.A quick glance at Microsoft's latest pro-merger fact sheet underlines its mobile plans. According to Microsoft, who cites data from analyst firm Newzoo, the mobile market is dominated by Tencent, Apple, and Google. The data shows that the combination of mobile gaming's Big 3 made up over 64% of total global mobile games earnings for 2022.4The breakdown looks like this:Tencent - $32.5 billionApple - $14.8 billionGoogle - $12.4 billion4Something to note: Apple's passive income from mobile games is almost as much as Microsoft's total Xbox revenues. Apple made $14.8 billion in calendar 2022, compared to Xbox's $15.56 billion earned in the same yearly period.It's also worth noting that Apple made more money from mobile games that Nintendo earned throughout the entire year of 2022 (Apple's $14.8 billion against Nintendo's $12.62 billion). Google's passive mobile game revenues also nearly beat Nintendo's total-year earnings throughout 2022 as well.Microsoft has revealed plans for a universal video games storefront/platform that unifies multiple platforms together. The Xbox brand already unifies consoles and PCs together using Game Pass, services, and content. Now Microsoft wants to fold mobile into that game plan, and so far, it has--gamers can stream Xbox titles directly to the mobile devices using Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.Activision's properties will help significantly boost the value of content offered in such a cross-platform, unified ecosystem across all dimensions of the games industry, including dedicated console and PC play, mobile games, and access to all games through cloud streaming.",

            "description": "On March 8, the highest-grossing mobile game in China, Honor of Kings (HoK), launched in Brazil, marking the Tencent TiMi Studio Group game\u2019s first foray into the global market. The number of pre-registered HoK players in Brazil before the MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) title\u2019s launch exceeded 2 million, quickly making it the most downloaded free mobile game in the country, according to a report from Chinese financial media outlet Baijing.Why it matters: The Brazilian launch is a key part of Tencent\u2019s global expansion as the Chinese gaming giant looks to overseas markets amid continued uncertainty at home due to heavy regulation and sluggish consumer spending. The team behind Honor of Kings hopes its experience in Brazil will lay a solid foundation for its future launch in other regions, such as Mexico, Egypt and Turkey, according to Tencent\u2019s overseas game distributor Level Infinite.Tencent is increasingly relying on the overseas gaming market for growth. In its 2022 third-quarter financial report, Tencent\u2019s global market revenue reached RMB 11.7 billion, more than one-third of its domestic game revenue RMB 31.2 billion.Details: HoK released a series of high-quality cinematic trailers on YouTube ahead of its Brazilian launch. The pre-registration trailer Hey Brazil received 2.3 million views on YouTube in its first month.Tencent has set up dedicated servers in Brazil for a smoother gaming experience in the country. The firm also employed well-known Brazilian voice actors for the characters in the Brazilian version of Honor of Kings, alongside localization of in-game text, user interfaces, and character designs.HoK was released in Brazil on the iOS App Store, Google Play Store for Android, and Samsung Store, with the title offering 5v5 Matchmaking, 5v5 Quick Mode, 5v5 Ranked Match, 1v1 Solo Mode, and a newly created Casual Mode called the Infinite Brawl.Level Infinite first announced on Twitter last June that HoK would be launched globally by the end of 2022. However, this was later postponed until this year, with the company partly blaming the Covid-19 pandemic.Context: In February 2023, Tencent\u2019s Honor of Kings remained the highest-grossing game app in China, earning about $113 million in monthly revenue. In 2022, Honor of Kings generated over $2.2 billion in revenue, making it one of the top-grossing mobile games of all time.At an event celebrating Honor of Kings\u2019 seventh anniversary held in November 2022, Tencent provided new details on its plans to build a \u201cuniverse\u201d around the hit game, teasing a range of spin-off titles including chess and Street Fighter-style battle games.According to Chinese media outlet Sina, Brazil is the largest gaming market in Latin America, generating $1.84 billion in revenue in 2022. Among the gamer population in Brazil, the proportion of young players aged between 18 and 24 is relatively high, accounting for more than 20%, which benefits MOBA games that need a high level of DAUs (daily active users) and appeal to this demographic.In recent years, Chinese gaming companies have increasingly looked to overseas markets for growth. In the top 100 list of highest-grossing mobile games in the global market, Chinese game publishers account for 40% of the US market, 43.1% of the Japanese market, and 49.1% of the Korean market, according to Chinese data research firm CNG\u2019s Global Mobile Game Market 2022 report.Chinese gaming giant Tencent doubled its stake in AAA game title developer and publisher Ubisoft to around 10% in 2022, a move it followed by taking a 20% stake in Korean studio Shift Up.READ MORE: Chinese gaming companies go overseas as home growth slows",

            "description": "Michael ViInvestment ThesisTech giant is a reductive adjective for Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY), this colossus owns the most popular Chinese social media, video and live-streaming platforms and has control over the Chinese gaming and fintech industries.While competition from other companies doesn\u2019t represent a big threat to Tencent given its scale of operations, the natural enemy of Tencent is the Chinese government and the series of crackdowns implemented on the tech industries.Despite the Chinese government getting in the way, Tencent delivered great results in the past and is expected to keep succeeding in the future.In today\u2019s analysis, we will assess why Tencent, despite having a current stock price higher than its intrinsic value of $39 per share, should be added to the investors\u2019 watchlist waiting for its price to decline making it a good investment opportunity.Business ModelTencent\u2019s business model is divided into four main segments: Games, Social Networks, Online Advertising, and FinTech services.Games and FinTech services account for the majority of revenues, respectively at 32% and 33% of total revenues, while Social Networks and Online Advertising revenues account for 20% and 15%.Being a tech conglomerate permits Tencent to have a well-diversified portfolio of operations that helped the company to perform relatively well even when one or more segments were tackled by government actions or macroeconomic issues in the past years.Regulation RisksBack in 2020, the Chinese government started introducing tighter regulations on tech companies, especially on the biggest ones like Tencent and Alibaba, to realign their interests with the ones of the Communist party.Many are the antitrust regulations imposed on Tencent, like being forced to terminate the upcoming merger of the two main Chinese streaming platforms, Huya and Douyu, in which Tencent had a majority stake, and being forced to give up on exclusive music rights on behalf of its subsidiary Tencent Music Entertainment (TME).Other than antitrust policies, Tencent had to face new regulations for the gaming industry that imposed restrictions on gamers under 18 years old to play online video games only during weekends and national holidays, and for a total of only three hours during that period. Beyond time constraints, also spending capabilities have been reduced for underage gamers, harming even further the gaming industry.Other than imposing restrictions, new video game approvals stopped for 9 months from July 2021 to April 2022 in China not permitting Tencent to introduce new titles to the market.Operating PerformanceLooking at Tencent\u2019s past operating performance, despite the actions of the Chinese government, Tencent\u2019s revenues managed to grow at a compound annual growth rate or CAGR of 27.5% since 2012, expected to be around $80 billion in 2022.Tencent revenues (TIKR Terminal)High growth rates have been accompanied by great efficiency and profitability having a 5-year median operating margin of 25.8% and a median return on invested capital or ROIC of 13.6%.Tencent 5Y operating margin & ROIC (TIKR Terminal)Combining high growth and high efficiency resulting in a solid and consistent cash flow generation, with FCFF that went from $2.1 billion in 2012 to $14.4 billion expected in 2022.Tencent FCFF (Personal Data)Financially Tencent has a negative net cash position of -$13 billion but can still be considered a healthy company having a current ratio of 1.45, a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.45, and an interest coverage ratio of 20.5.Tencent financial position (TIKR Terminal)Growth DriversAs a tech conglomerate, Tencent has different growth drivers. Other than R&D expenses, which are needed to keep developing cutting-edge technologies that will enrich Tencent\u2019s ecosystem, Tencent heavily relies on the purchase of intangible assets like music and game licensing needed to support the music and video game platforms. Last but not least, Tencent future growth is derived from the investments made in acquisitions to acquire new and already underway proprietary technologies.Future growth can be determined by looking at how much and how well a company has invested in its growth drivers. The Reinvestment Margin shows what percentage of revenues has been reinvested into the company, while the Sales to Invested Capital ratio, shows how much revenues have been generated for each dollar invested by the company. If we multiply these two values and take the median value over the years, we obtain the expected growth rate in revenues based on how much and how well a company has invested in its growth drivers.In our case, Tencent\u2019s expected growth rate is 16.17%.Tencent expected growth rate (Personal Data)DCF ModelI use the discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") analysis method to value companies. The aim of a DCF analysis is to determine the present value of expected cash flows generated by the company in the future. The first step is to project the growth rate at which revenues will grow in the future. Secondly, we will need to assume the degree of efficiency and profitability at which the company will turn revenues into cash flows.Efficiency is represented by the operating margin, and profitability by the ROIC. Having the revenue projections and future operating margins, we obtain the EBIT and, after subtracting taxes, we get the net operating profit after taxes. The ROIC is used to determine the reinvestments needed to support future growth, determining how much profit the company generates from every dollar reinvested into the company.Future cash flows are calculated by subtracting the reinvestments from the net operating profit after taxes. The higher the growth rate, the higher the reinvestments needed to support it, hence the lower future cash flows will be.The last step of a DCF analysis is to apply the discount rate to future cash flows, usually calculated using the weighted average cost of capital ('WACC').ProjectionsProjecting Tencent\u2019s performance into the future, we can start by forecasting future revenues by applying the expected growth rate of 16.17% and letting it slowly decline as the company enters its steady state. With these assumptions revenues are expected to reach $185 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 8.76%.Moving on to future efficiency and profitability, being Tencent a well-diversified and established company with significant leadership in the markets in with it operates, we can expect the operating margin to remain around its historical values of 25%, while the ROIC can be expected to improve to 18% by 2032 as the company entering its maturity phase stops to invest heavily for future growth.With that said, FCFF are expected to remain solid and consistent reaching $27.3 billion by 2032.Tencent performance projections (Personal Data)ValuationApplying a discount rate of 8.2%, calculated using the WACC, the present value of these cash flows is equal to an equity value of $368 billion or $39.2 per share.Tencent intrinsic value (Personal Data)ConclusionGiven my analysis and assumptions, Tencent\u2019s stocks result to be slightly overvalued at today\u2019s prices.Thanks to its scale of operations, Tencent has proved to have a resilient business model able to survive the numerous attacks from the Chinese government, and despite the many regulations imposed, can be expected to keep thriving in the future. However, at the moment, Tencent should be carefully kept on our watchlists waiting for a significant price correction that will make the company a great investment opportunity.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

            "description": "The first attempt to bring Liu Cixin\u2019s \u201cThe Three-Body Problem\u201d to the big screen ended in complete failure.In 2009, when Liu\u2019s \u201cRemembrance of Earth\u2019s Past\u201d series was still largely unknown outside of Chinese science fiction circles, the horror film director Zhang Panpan bought their film and television adaptation rights for the absurdly low sum of 100,000 yuan (then about $14,600). Five years later, as the series\u2019 popularity grew, Zhang collaborated with the media company Yoozoo on a film version. The project never got anywhere near cinemas. Among fans, rumors spread that it was unwatchable.In 2018, after Zhang sold the rights to Yoozoo for $18 million, the company tried again, this time by fast-tracking development on several proposed adaptations at once. The first of these, an animated version co-produced by YHKT Entertainment and streaming platform Bilibili, finally premiered in late 2022, followed quickly by a live-action adaptation from Tencent this January. An English-language adaptation is slated to hit Netflix later this year.Much of the early press in the runup to the two shows\u2019 release focused on YHKT\u2019s animated adaptation. A well-respected studio known for hits like \u201cIncarnation,\u201d YHKT seemed ideally positioned to translate Liu\u2019s ambitious worldbuilding into reality, while Tencent struggled to overcome a ham-fisted marketing campaign that seemed to suggest a fast-and-loose approach to the source material.What a difference a few months makes. Almost immediately, fans turned on the animated version, sending its score on popular ratings site Douban plummeting to a lowly 3.9 out of 10; meanwhile, the live-action version has come from behind to almost completely displace its rival in the popular zeitgeist.At the root of this reversal, ironically, is the live-action adaptation\u2019s far better grasp of Liu\u2019s original. YHKT opted to all but skip the entire first book in the series, opening with the climax of \u201cThe Three-Body Problem\u201d before immediately segueing into its sequel, \u201cThe Dark Forest.\u201d This decision may have been motivated by the difficulty of portraying Liu\u2019s searing vision of the Cultural Revolution in the current media regulatory environment, but based on the scenes the show does include, it is just as likely that YHKT was worried the first book\u2019s lack of action would bore viewers.By contrast, the second book offers a Hollywood-ready heroic narrative, one which YHKT pairs with a hero straight out of a 1990s action flick: The show spends copious screentime establishing the protagonist, Luo Ji, as a bad boy, even adding scenes not in the book to reinforce his character\u2019s personality: He drives a race car, flies a fighter jet, and hosts extravagant parties.The animated version\u2019s obsession with Hollywood sci-fi, even at the expense of Liu\u2019s \u201cgolden-age\u201d reference points, is also reflected in its art direction. The series\u2019 futuristic cities are portrayed as cyberpunk wastelands, a choice at odds with the spirit of Liu\u2019s work. As a fan of Arthur C. Clark and a writer deeply influenced by both traditional Chinese culture and socialism, Liu retains a strong faith in the future. This faith is absent from YHKT\u2019s imitation-cyberpunk style.Contrast this with the live-action version, a high point of which was its adaptation of life in the Greater Khingan Mountain Range in the 1970s \u2014 a place imbued with revolutionary enthusiasm and regarded by many fans as the setting of the first book\u2019s most exciting chapter.Indeed, despite the early concerns, it\u2019s not an exaggeration to say Tencent\u2019s adaptation is the most loyal to its source material I\u2019ve seen since CCTV adapted China\u2019s \u201cFour Great Classical Novels\u201d in the 1980s and \u201990s. Discerning viewers will find that many scenes and lines in the series are taken verbatim from the book.This is not to say the Tencent version is the definitive adaptation of \u201cThe Three-Body Problem.\u201d To begin with, although the show is popular, its success still pales in comparison to the attention given to the recent gangster drama \u201cThe Knockout.\u201d And Chinese directors still struggle to balance faithfulness to the source material with the needs of on-screen action. For example, one dialogue-heavy riddle sequence has thrilled fans of the book for its fidelity to Liu\u2019s vision; for an ordinary viewer, however, the scene\u2019s barrage of new concepts is exhausting, and something the show could improve on in its second season.In the meantime, the pressure is now on Netflix. Enthusiasm within China for the streaming platform\u2019s adaptation has been low since news broke it would be helmed by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, the pair responsible for the infamous finale of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d While it will likely benefit from high-quality special effects and a far larger international audience, many Chinese fans worry about the difficulty of globalizing a very Chinese story without losing its local flavor. They fret it\u2019ll fall into either essentializing stereotypes about China or become a clich\u00e9d Hollywood narrative about saving the world.Then again, the charm of Liu\u2019s novel lies in the room it leaves for interpretation. A mix of Chinese history and golden-age futurism, local color and universal themes, it offers endless room for experimentation. The best adaptations should not just be loyal to the original work, they should offer us a mirror through which we can see ourselves.Translator: Matt Turner; editors: Cai Yineng and Kilian O\u2019Donnell.(Header image: Promotional images of Tencent (left) and YHTK's adaptations of \u201cThe Three-Body Problem.\u201d From Douban)",

REUTERS/Tingshu Wang Acquire Licensing RightsHONG KONG, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) has set up a development team to work on a ChatGPT-like chatbot, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.ChatGPT's uncanny ability to create cogent blocks of text instantly has sparked worldwide frenzied interest in the technology behind it called generative AI.Although Microsoft-backed OpenAI does not allow users in China to create accounts to access the chatbot, the open AI models behind the programme are relatively accessible and are increasingly being incorporated into Chinese consumer technology applications.A number of Tencent rivals including Alibaba Group (9988.HK) and Baidu Inc (9888.HK) have also announced they are working on their own offerings.Tencent's product, to be called \"HunyuanAide\", will incorporate the company's AI training model named \"Hunyuan\", said the people who were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.Asked for comment, Tencent reiterated a Feb.9 statement that it is conducting research on ChatGPT-tool technology.The news comes after China's Ministry of Science and Technology said on Friday it saw the potential of ChatGPT-like tech and would be pushing for the integration of artificial intelligence into Chinese society and the economy.According to the South China Morning Post, Tencent's Hunyuan AI model in November achieved a record-high score on the Chinese Language Understanding Evaluation (CLUE) test - a set of tasks used to assess a computer's ability to understand and respond to Chinese text.That also marked the first time an AI model has scored better than humans on CLUE since the test was established three years ago.Local media outlet 36kr first reported the establishment of the \"HunyuanAide\" team.Reporting by Josh Ye; Editing by Edwina GibbsOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "description": "Chinese technology giant Tencent has created a new team to develop a product similar to the hugely popular OpenAI chatbot ChatGPT. The artificial intelligence tool is expected to be called HunyuanAide and built on large language model Hunyuan.Few details have been revealed but the Tencent chatbot will be called HunyuanAid and based on its secretive large language model. (Photo by Sergei Elagin/Shutterstock)Unnamed insiders speaking to Reuters revealed the secret plans, which have yet to be confirmed by Tencent. The company has been widely tipped to develop its own AI chatbot after rivals Baidu and Alibaba confirmed plans for their own systems. Tencent says it is conducting research into ChatGPT-like technology but hasn\u2019t revealed any more details about the product, how it will be made available, or the size of the model used to power it.Tencent\u2019s AI model is particularly good at understanding the Chinese language and does so better than humans. That is based on a recent benchmarking exercise, and such abilities will be essential in the creation of a natural language chatbot for use in the Chinese market.ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence chatbot that can generate natural language responses based on user input. Powered by large language models that learn from analysing large amounts of publicly available text during its training period, it can output a wide and varied content set.It can be used to write articles, poems, movie scripts or summarise pieces of text. The tool has also been used to write reports and plans for enterprise, malware and code. ChatGPT isn\u2019t available in China but despite it being officially blocked, users have been actively trying to gain access.Since its launch at the end of November 2022, ChatGPT has become one of the fastest-growing consumer products of all time with 100 million active monthly users in January alone.This has prompted some of the largest technology companies in the world to pivot and launch new similar products. Microsoft has launched Bing Search, which is based on the technology behind OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, and Google is developing Bard a search chatbot based on its powerful LaMDA large language model.China reacts to US AI US competitionChinese internet and technology company Baidu announced it would launch a search chatbot within the first quarter of 2023 called Ernie, built on its massive language model Ernie 3.0 which has 260 billion parameters, This is significantly more than the 175bn behind GPT-3 from OpenAI and 137 billion in the Google LaMDA model used to power Bard.Speaking to Tech Monitor last month, venture capitalist and creator of Tech Buzz China, Rui Ma, said there was discussion in the country over finding the best opportunity and right opportunity for chatbot-like technology. It has the potential to transform search, copywriting and even automate white-collar roles at a large scale which could solve some of China\u2019s ageing population challenges, she explained.View all newsletters Sign up to our newsletters Data, insights and analysis delivered to you By The Tech Monitor team Sign up hereIt appears that Chinese companies were left scrambling to develop a chatbot-type solution, despite being perceptively \u201cfar ahead\u201d when it comes to large language models and AI generally.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that China doesn\u2019t have the brainpower, or even necessarily a fundamental understanding of the models, because they\u2019re mainly based on research from a few years ago,\u201d said Ma. \u201cIt was more like, even if you had the brainpower, if you didn\u2019t have the vision to go in this direction and actually create this, then you wouldn\u2019t have made it.\u201dChina\u2019s artificial intelligence sector is \u201cwell placed\u201d to catch up with the US when it comes to chatbots and natural language tools. It has already done the same with foundation AI models when Bauidu launched Ernie a year after Google published Bert in 2018.Chinese government and wider impactChinese government officials are also said to be supportive of ChatGPT-like technology, with ministers pushing for it to be integrated into Chinese society. Chen Jiachang, head of China\u2019s Ministry of Science and Technology told reporters last week that it \u201chas the potential to be applied in many industries and fields\u201d.The push for a home-grown solution comes as Chinese regulators warn internet companies against offering access to ChatGPT itself, describing it as a tool for spreading American government misinformation.Meanwhile, campaigners and academics in the UK have called on the government to get behind a project for the UK to build its own large language model that could power tools like ChatGPT and reduce the reliance on models owned by US corporations.Sanjeev Kumar, VP EMEA at Boost.ai told Tech Monitor there has been a groundswell of interest and enthusiasm for AI-powered chat and voicebots in the past few weeks as ChatGPT raised the profile for the technology and put it in front of millions of people. \u201cNow, we\u2019re seeing big-name tech players mobilise to build their own offerings, as the public imagination remains captured by the ergonomic interface that conversational and generative AI offers,\u201d he said.The race will now begin for the Chinese tech giants to become the go-to for generative AI solutions for Chinese users and Tencent is well placed to fill the voice, with the scope for its adoption of any conversational AI platform huge, especially given its ownership of WeChat as the audience is already in place to utilise an AI chatbot.\u201cHowever, you don\u2019t have to be a multi-billion-pound company to transform your customer experience with conversational AI,\u201d Kumar added. \u201cNow is the time for businesses of all shapes and sizes to seize the initiative and place conversational AI at the heart of their customer service offerings as well, as customers become more familiarised with chatbots and voicebots, and expectations increase for a better customer experience.\u201d",

            "description": "The prevalence of artificial intelligence has been growing fast this year, especially in the public eye. From chatbots, to technology converting text to speech, to imitating famous voices and producing generated artwork, the utility of AI has certainly been expanding of late.In the gaming sphere, AI is already being embraced in the development process with companies such as UK-based Kwalee introducing KAI (Kwalee Artificial Intelligence), enabling employees to pitch AI-enhanced ideas.Metaverse giant Roblox has been considering AI\u2019s future, too. By implementing generative AI technology, CTO Daniel Sturman believes that creation processes could be simplified to a point where anyone could create experiences.But how are Chinese developers reacting to the AI craze?Room for AIPerhaps one of the most well-known AI chatbots is ChatGPT developed by OpenAI, a US startup. It is unavailable in China in an official capacity, but some of the country\u2019s larger technology firms have revealed intentions to create similar services, according to South China Morning Post.Given the Chinese government\u2019s tumultuous relationship with gaming, such as its games licence freeze that lasted almost nine months and its crackdown on livestreaming unauthorised games, the question of whether western AI technology would be permitted in Chinese games may well have been stirring in many minds. Currently, it appears more likely that Chinese companies will be using AI of their own.TikTok owner ByteDance, for example, is reportedly researching language and imaging AI, meanwhile NetEase subsidiary Youdao is considering the use of a service like ChatGPT\u2019s. In the latter\u2019s upcoming mobile game Nishuihan, there are intentions to implement a chatbot for better conversation with in-game characters.A recent Inworld AI report found that 99 percent of gamers are excited for AI NPCs.As for Tencent, once China\u2019s biggest company, there have been no announcements of a unique Tencent AI, but the company has implied that it has the technologies needed to support such generated content and will continue to invest in them.",

            "description": "This is an extract from a recent article written by Pony Ma, Co-Founder, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Tencent Holdings Ltd., on the company\u2019s progress of its \u201cTech for Good\u201d mission and creating sustainable social value.Many years ago, a Tencent employee collapsed during his morning jog and passed away. This incident had a great impact on me. Our inability to help and the lack of a medical emergency response remains a painful personal memory.The tragedy made me think long and hard about how one can find first aid equipment and first aiders as quickly as possible when someone is in a medical emergency.Some colleagues and I eventually came up with an idea to develop a digital emergency response system that complements China\u2019s 120 emergency call system. We tested it first inside Tencent.When someone faints, anyone can just scan an emergency code nearby to call the closest volunteers. Last year, someone fainted in our building. Using this system, within four minutes, more than 20 colleagues came to the rescue.Similar first aid systems have now been installed in nearly 40 universities, shopping malls, communities and industrial parks, achieving rapid response within four minutes.We have now launched an open platform for emergency response, connecting tens of thousands of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) and volunteers and allowing the public to check the location of AEDs in real-time on a map.At the same time, considering the difficulty of first aid for the hearing-impaired, we have made it possible to call 120 by text through AI-driven technology. Such accessibility functions have been adopted in first aid centers in more than 40 cities across China, and are already potentially saving lives.I share this story to illustrate how Tencent has evolved as a company, one that is driven by humanity to develop technology for good.Caring for Others, Reimagining Our FuturesThe United Nations recently released the latest Human Development Report: \u201cUncertain Times, Unsettled Lives: Shaping our Future in a Transforming World.\u201d It found that we are living in times of great uncertainty caused by factors such as COVID-19, climate change, geopolitical tensions, and cost-of-living pressures.The report makes for sobering reading, but it concludes that there are opportunities to reimagine our futures and who we are and what we value. It also made me think that despite the difficult times, there are many heart-warming stories that reassure us and provide some certainty in our lives.We know of many people who care about those around them, and want to make the world a better place.Among them is Guangqian Yang, a retiree in Yunnan Province in his 60s. Yang has donated 30 million steps over three years through Tencent\u2019s charity platform, which we then convert into tangible support. He has done so simply by undertaking his daily commute from his home to the hospital where he volunteers. \u201cI just want to do my bit and make a small contribution,\u201d says Yang.Jia Zhu, a professor at Nanjing University and recipient of Tencent\u2019s Xplorer Prize for scientific innovation, is working with Tencent\u2019s Carbon Neutrality Laboratory to test a new type of radiative cooling technology on Dagu Glacier in Sichuan Province. Preliminary estimates suggest that, if successful, it can slow the decline of Dagu Glacier by around 80 percent.The actions of Yang, Professor Zhu and others like them may vary in scale and ambition. But they all have the same mentality of thinking beyond personal interests to care for others, whether it\u2019s helping their neighbors, villages, and children in need, to protecting glaciers from global warming.Building Products that Provoke Emotions, Solving Global and Societal ChallengesI used to say that Tencent is a connector, mainly referring to its role as a connecting tool. Later, as we explored social value in-depth, we realized that the essence of connection goes beyond tools. This essence should be caring for people. Our success has come because we have been striving to understand the needs of users and constantly working to improve our products and experiences.Some time ago, I proposed the concept of a CBS trinity, and how the main receiving end of the services provided by the internet has transitioned from consumer to business, and now to society. An internet product creates value only when it has applications and is used, and the best can help solve societal and global challenges.That led to the establishment of Tencent\u2019s Sustainable Social Value (SSV) Group in 2021. The group has been exploring innovation in areas such as charity digitization, education innovation, public emergency response, digitalization of cultural relics, carbon neutrality and FEW (Food, Energy and Water).Guided by Tencent\u2019s vision of \u201cValue for Users, Tech for Good\u201d and concepts such as SSV, we work to concretize emotions like kindness and care into implementable strategies, actions, products and operations. In addition to the digital emergency response systems, our various technologies are being used across a wide spectrum of fields to benefit society.We have applied the noise reduction technologies of Tencent Meeting/VooV Meeting to cochlear implants and hearing aids to help children and the elderly with hearing impairment, gaming technologies to the construction of highly-simulated internet-based factories, and AI-driven technologies to the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), nicknamed Sky Eye, to find pulsars.Investing in Social Good is of Paramount Importance as R&D InvestmentCaring for people is key to the continued growth of Tencent, and I firmly believe that it is the basis for the development of modern enterprises. The investment in sustainable social value is as important as that in research and development of technologies.To turn this vision into reality, it is vital that we integrate social and commercial value. The creation of social value should not be the responsibility of a separate department, but must be gradually integrated into our main business scope.Weixin Pay has already made such attempts. It has launched the \u201cLove Meals with Weixin\u201d and \u201cDrinks with Love\u201d campaigns, where thousands of food and beverage outlets encourage Weixin Pay users to make a donation to sanitation workers.Weixin Pay also partners with merchants such as coffee shops to advocate low-carbon consumption through the use of a low-carbon data interface on the app.Another example is the \u201cSelf-reliance Shop\u201d program launched by Weixin to help people with disabilities get a job. It provides digital business accessibility tools for people with disabilities, and partners with community organizations to promote users to purchase at these self-reliance shops.The establishment of charity channels in common consumption scenarios has made it easy for users to make a donation, enhanced the reputation of Weixin Pay, and solved a social pain point in an innovative way all at once. In the future, I hope more enterprises will benefit people and society through the use of their core technological capabilities. A new network of collaboration, driven by technological innovation that blends business capabilities with social purposes, will be formed. It will be a multi-layered, systematic, globalized and co-created platform that develops technology for good.",

            "description": "[1/2] A staff member is seen at a booth of Tencent at an exhibition during China Internet Conference in Beijing, China July 13, 2021. REUTERS/Tingshu Wang Acquire Licensing RightsHONG KONG, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) is abandoning plans to venture into virtual reality hardware, as a sobering economic outlook prompts the Chinese tech giant to cut costs and headcount at its metaverse unit, three sources familiar with the matter said.The world's largest video game publisher had ambitious plans to build both virtual reality software and hardware at an \"extended reality\" XR unit it launched in June last year, for which it hired nearly 300 people.It had come up with a concept for a ring-like hand-held game controller, but difficulties in achieving quick profitability and the large investment needed to produce a competitive product were among factors that prompted a shift away from that strategy, two of the sources said.One of the sources said the XR project was not expected to become profitable until 2027, according to an internal forecast. The second source said the unit also had a lack of promising games and non-gaming applications.The sources declined to be named as the information is confidential.\"Under the company's new strategy as a whole, it no longer quite fit in,\" the first source said.Earlier in the year, Tencent had also planned to buy gaming phone maker Black Shark, which it believed had supply chain and inventory experience that could beef up its hardware push and add 1,000 people to the unit.However, it eventually walked away from that deal due to Tencent's shift in strategy, as well as mounting regulatory scrutiny and an expected lengthy review process, one of the sources who had direct knowledge of the matter said.The sources said that Tencent had advised most of the unit's staff to seek other opportunities, confirming a Thursday report from Chinese tech news outlet 36Kr.Tencent declined to comment on the Black Shark deal and whether Beijing's scrutiny had soured the deal. Regarding the status of the XR unit, the company referred to a statement to Reuters on Thursday that said it was making adjustments to some business teams as development plans for hardware had changed.The company also said on Thursday that it was not disbanding the XR unit.Tencent shares slipped as much as 2.5% after Reuters' report.METAVERSE INTERESTThe launch of the XR unit came amid swelling global interest in the metaverse concept of virtual worlds and had marked a rare foray into hardware for Tencent, which is mostly known for software that includes a suite of games and social media applications.It also entered into a race against Western peers such as Meta Platforms (META.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O), which are building their own metaverses and have their own virtual reality hardware projects.One of the sources said that Tencent had dabbled in virtual reality about seven years ago for a short while, and its interest in the area had been revived in 2021 after learning of new breakthroughs in pancake lenses and more powerful displays. Strong sales of Meta's Quest headset was also a driver, the person added.But last year marked one of the toughest years for Tencent since its founding in 1998, with revenue battered by a regulatory crackdown and headwinds from measures to stop the spread of COVID-19.Underlining such strains, its founder Pony Ma in December displayed a rare show of frustration at a year-end meeting when he lambasted senior managers for not working hard enough and said the company needed to focus on short video for future growth.Several tech companies include Meta and Google have announced layoffs as they seek to trim costs amid rising fears of a global recession.Pico, a virtual reality (VR) headset manufacturer owned by TikTok's Chinese developer ByteDance, said on Friday it was laying off a small number of people, after local media reported the start of hundreds of redundancies earlier this week. A source familiar with the matter said 200 staff were affected.Reporting by Josh Ye; writing by Brenda Goh; editing by Sam Holmes and Sharon SingletonOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "description": "(Yicai Global) Feb. 17 -- With Tencent Holding winding up its extended reality department and Pico, a virtual reality firm owned by ByteDance, laying off staff, industry insiders believe the initial frenzy over the metaverse is cooling.Tencent\u2019s XR business will change its development path, and team adjustments will be made accordingly, the Shenzhen-based tech giant told Yicai Global. The personnel changes are mainly based on industry factors, an insider said, adding that Tencent has not given up exploring the XR business but will consider other directions.Tencent set up the business, which includes immersive technologies such as VR, augmented reality, and mixed reality, in June last year to develop software and hardware for Tencent Interactive Entertainment Group to enter the metaverse field.The XR business aims to seize opportunities to create industry benchmark-level VR products and experiences in the next four to five years, Tencent Vice President Ma Xiaoyi said at the time.But the XR industry has been quite unstable recently. Microsoft disbanded its Industrial Metaverse Team four months ago, resulting in 100 employees being let go. Crayta, a Roblox-like metaverse gaming platform owned by Meta, will shut down on March 3.The actions of different companies in the XR business cannot be directly compared, but the common element is that the irrational fever over the metaverse has gone, Liao Xuhua, a senior analyst at Analysys, told Yicai Global. For example, Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens and Azure digital twin business will continue to operate normally, he noted.Pico recently carried out a round of layoffs, but the ratio is not high, the person in charge of ByteDance\u2019s VR business said to Yicai Global. Only some parts of the business were involved in the redundancies, which was a standard adjustment and will not affect normal business operations, the person added.Liao said that last year Pico set too-high a target and gave an over generous marketing budget to a product that lacked strong content support, making it easier to miss the year-end objectives. There is no issue with Pico\u2019s products, and the firm will continue to invest in VR technologies, Liao said.San Francisco-based AI lab OpenAI recently launched ChatGPT, an AI chatbot that became extremely popular among users and tech firms. Many Chinese companies have also announced plans to enter the AI-generated content field.Most of the companies that adopted aggressive layouts in the AIGC field can potentially benefit from it in terms of business scenarios and already have advantages in such technologies, according to Lu Guanan, an analyst at Forrester.Editor: Futura Costaglione",

If the deal comes together, it would give Meta access to a huge new market that is even more attuned to the online world than the U.S.Discussions are still reportedly in the early phase and are complicated by the fact that Facebook has been banned in China since 2009. The companies would need to not only get past that hurdle, but also determine how data would be handled and, most likely, clear any U.S. scrutiny. Meta is already in the sights of government regulators, and a deal with China could prompt more questions.Also uncertain is the audience Meta would target. Horizon Worlds hasn\u2019t seen big successes in the U.S., and the company is considering widening the audience to teens as young as 13 in the U.S. China often shields younger users from certain online activities.The VR and metaverse divisions of Meta have been significant financial drains on the company. The Reality Labs division, which houses both, was responsible for $13.7 billion in losses last year. And the talks come as Meta could be preparing for another major round of layoffs, after cutting 11,000 jobs in November.The Quest 2 has earned praise from critics, but sales have slowed in North America, as expectations of an Apple mixed-reality headset this year continue to grow and many expect Meta to release the Meta Quest 3 as well.Opening the Chinese market could give the headset a big sales boost\u2014and could be a boon for gamemakers as well, given China\u2019s dedication to video games.",

Last year, Tencent reported that total time spent by underage players in its titles was down 88% year-over-year.The country later proposed even tougher regulations, including holding parents of \u201caddicted\u201d children accountable and making all game companies use facial recognition systems to verify a user\u2019s age and identity (Tencent already has one as part of its \u201cMidnight Patrol\u201d initiative).Despite the bad regulatory climate, the National Press and Publication Administration has started licensing more video games in China in recent months. After ending a long freeze, the regulator even approved a first batch of foreign titles in December. In the first two months of 2023, the NPPA licensed 175 new games, nearly one-third of the total number approved last year.However, foreign and even domestic developers are still struggling to enter the Chinese games market, having to fight their way through tough regulations and exhausting processes to reach local gamers.",

            "description": "Tencent Holdings Ltd. is planning to launch a Valorant esports league when the hit shooter title debuts in China this year, one of the strongest signs yet that the country\u2019s internet giants are getting back to business after a two-year industry crackdown.Tencent unit TJ Sports has held discussions with top Chinese esports players in recent days about setting up the competition, people familiar with the matter said. It could kick off a tournament over the summer at the earliest as Tencent rolls out the game domestically, one of the people said, asking to not be identified discussing private information.Talks are in their initial stages and Tencent could push back its timeline, the people said. But a Valorant league will help reboot competitive online gaming in China after a two-year lull, when pandemic restrictions and Beijing\u2019s clampdown on youth addiction chilled the world\u2019s largest gaming arena.AdvertisementAlso Read | Four Xbox Game Pass Ultimate perks you might have missed outLaunched globally in 2020, Valorant has grown to become one of the most popular esports titles, vying for a multibillion-dollar market along with rival shooters like Blizzard\u2019s Overwatch. Tencent won approval to roll out the title only in December, in what investors took as a sign that the government was preparing to relax its grip on the sector.Tencent\u2019s shares extended gains in late Hong Kong trading to climb as much as 1.8% before ending largely unchanged. Brokerages including Morgan Stanley have raised their price targets on Tencent in recent weeks, anticipating a recovery in growth as restrictions ease and efforts to sell video ads gain momentum.\u201cThese are positive signs that China tech companies are back to business with regulatory headwinds largely behind,\u201d said Marvin Chen, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cIt is also in line with recent comments from policymakers that innovation is still in a prominent position for national development.\u201dA Tencent representative said in a message the company was making preparations related to Valorant and hadn\u2019t confirmed a launch date for the game.AdvertisementA Valorant extravaganza would add to Tencent\u2019s roster of Chinese competitive leagues, spanning genres from battle arenas to racing and first-person shooters. Tencent set up TJ Sports with US subsidiary Riot Games Inc. in 2019 to helm League of Legends contests. Another unit runs tournaments based on Honor of Kings, Tencent\u2019s long-running mobile cash-cow.Valorant, along with the potential esports festivities, will help Tencent bolster a business crippled by stricter online content scrutiny. Growth for the WeChat operator has all but evaporated since 2021, when regulators began to establish curbs on everything from gaming time to undesirable content.\u201cWe view Tencent\u2019s launch of a gaming league as a positive and bodes well for both the company and the broader Chinese gaming sector in 2023 and beyond,\u201d said Esme Pau, an analyst with Macquarie Capital Ltd. \u201cWith NPPA\u2019s approvals for both domestic and imported games (such as Valorant) signaling higher transparency, Chinese game companies are better positioned to invest and launch marketing efforts around major franchises and hence drive higher gaming momentum and revenue.\u201dAdvertisementIn December, the Chinese social media giant secured a green-light for a clutch of major releases including Valorant and Pok\u00e9mon Unite, reinforcing hopes China is easing a two-year crackdown on Big Tech. Valorant in particular attracted attention because Beijing had in the past signaled its disapproval of violent shooting games with perceived Western cultural overtones. Tencent was forced to replace PUBG, for instance, with a less gory alternative named PeaceKeeper Elite that also came with political slogans.The company has invested billions of dollars in talent agencies, streaming sites and tournament organizers to create the infrastructure necessary to turn pro gaming from a niche into an instrumental part of its growth strategy.The League of Legends Pro League in China \u2014 operated by TJ \u2014 is the world\u2019s largest esports league in terms of partnered teams and viewership. The Shanghai-based outfit has generated roughly $150 million in revenue in its first two years by selling media rights, tickets and merchandise.Outside China, Riot itself organizes three Valorant international leagues with a collective 30 teams in places like Los Angeles, Seoul and Berlin.",

VALORANT currently has three international leagues covering the Americas, EMEA, and Pacific regions.Prior to the rumored league surfacing, the recent VALORANT Esports China conference held in Shanghai last week already generated significant interest from some of China\u2019s largest esports organizations, including Top Esports, Nova Esports, Rare Atom, and others, to enter the ecosystem.

            "description": "The WeChat logo is displayed on a smartphone with a Tencent logo in the background. (Photo Illustration by Sheldon Cooper /SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)Chinese multimedia conglomerate Tencent Holdings is one of the largest companies in the world and owns hundreds of brands and subsidiaries, including WeChat. With over a billion active users, WeChat serves as China\u2019s primary messaging app, social media platform and payment app all rolled into one platform. But WeChat, like ByteDance\u2019s TikTok, has come under heavy scrutiny over concerns of user privacy and national security.Over the last three years, Tencent has spent $6.3 million lobbying the federal government. Tencent began spending on federal lobbying in 2020, the same year former President Donald Trump signed executive orders banning WeChat and TikTok in the United States.While WeChat has become a staple of everyday Chinese life, the app reportedly became pivotal to Beijing\u2019s surveillance and censorship apparatus. Human rights groups including Human Rights Watch have warned the Chinese government has used WeChat to monitor citizens, spread propaganda and crush dissent.Collaboration between Tencent and the Chinese government has caused concern over the data of international users, leading Trump to attempt to ban WeChat.\u201cLike TikTok, WeChat automatically captures vast swaths of information from its users. This data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans\u2019 personal and proprietary information,\u201d reads Executive Order 13943.The order was signed in August of 2020. Tencent ramped up its lobbying spending to $840,000 in the third quarter of 2020, an increase of 1,767% from the $45,000 it spent in the second quarter of that year.In late September 2020, Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler blocked the order on First Amendment grounds, saying \u201cthere are no viable substitute platforms or apps for the Chinese-speaking and Chinese-American community.\u201dIn the fourth quarter of 2020, Tencent spent another $594,000 in lobbying, totalling about $1.5 million over the year.In 2021, Tencent continued lobbying the federal government, spending $2.5 million over the course of the year, an annual increase of 64%. In June, President Joe Biden revoked the bans by executive order, instead directing the Department of Commerce to conduct national security reviews.\u201cThe Federal Government should evaluate these threats through rigorous, evidence-based analysis and should address any unacceptable or undue risks consistent with overall national security, foreign policy, and economic objectives, including the preservation and demonstration of America\u2019s core values and fundamental freedoms,\u201d states Executive Order 14034.Last year, Tencent spent another $2.3 million on lobbying. The agencies it lobbied include the Commerce Department, the State Department, the National Security Council, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Executive Office of the President. Today, WeChat is still available for download in the U.S.Tencent declined to comment on its lobbying efforts.Tencent amasses video game empire through acquisitionsTencent has also spent the last few years growing its entertainment empire, particularly in the video game industry. Through its investments and acquisitions, Tencent has become the largest video game company by revenue.Tencent owns shares in some of the largest western video game companies, including French developer Ubisoft. Tencent owns 40% of U.S. Fortnite developer Epic Games, which had a 2022 valuation of $32 billion. The holding company also entirely owns Funcom, Clash of Clans developer Supercell and Riot Games, the developer of League of Legends and Valorant. Over the last year, the Chinese multimedia conglomerate has continued to invest in foreign game developers and publishers, reportedly shifting to an aggressive expansion strategy in the last few months.Increased corporate consolidation of the gaming industry isn\u2019t unique to foreign investors. Microsoft announced its intention to acquire publisher Activision-Blizzard for $69 billion, which prompted a formal warning from the EU this week on antitrust grounds. Last year, Sony acquired Destiny developer Bungie for $3.6 billion.",

            "description": "Hong Kong CNN \u2014Investors have raced back into Chinese tech stocks this year, encouraged by an apparent truce in a two-year battle between some of the country\u2019s most powerful regulators and its biggest internet companies.But the enthusiasm may prove to be premature; Beijing is tightening its grip on household names such as Alibaba (BABA) by acquiring so-called \u201cgolden shares\u201d that allow government officials to be directly involved in their businesses, including having a say in the content they provide to hundreds of millions of people.Earlier this month, a fund controlled by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) took a 1% stake in Alibaba\u2019s digital media subsidiary in Guangzhou, according to business data platform Qichacha. The subsidiary \u2014 Guangzhou Lujiao Information Technology \u2014 has a portfolio of businesses under its wing, including mobile browser UCWeb and streaming video site Youku Tudou.According to Qichacha, a new board member, who has the same name as a mid-level official at the CAC, was appointed to the subsidiary at the same time. Alibaba didn\u2019t respond to CNN request for comments. Calls to the CAC went unanswered.According to a person familiar with the matter, the Chinese government is also discussing taking a similar stake in a mainland Chinese subsidiary of Tencent (TCEHY), the group that includes WeChat and a vast gaming business. The terms have not been finalized yet, the person said. Tencent (TCEHY) declined to comment.The headquarters of the Cyberspace Administration of China in Beijing, China on July 16, 2021. Yan Cong/Bloomber/Getty ImagesIron grip remainsThe moves come as Beijing has signaled that its two-year onslaught on the internet industry is coming to an end. As the economy falters, the ruling Communist Party needs the private sector to boost jobs and growth.But that doesn\u2019t mean China is changing its attitude towards companies it believes have become too powerful.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a change of heart that caused Beijing to pull back its regulatory push on tech companies, it was a concession to economic reality,\u201d said Brock Silvers, chief investment officer for Kaiyuan Capital in Hong Kong.\u201cThe goal of furthering state control over sprawling tech empires, however, wasn\u2019t abandoned.\u201dInstead, Beijing is returning to the \u201cgolden shares\u201d approach, by which the state can still assert control over these firms, while moderating its impact on markets, Silvers added.\u201cGolden shares\u201d give their owners, usually governments, some level of control over companies, often those that were previously state-owned.In China, such shares are called \u201cspecial management shares\u201d and give the government decisive voting rights or veto power over certain business decisions or \u2014 in the case of internet companies \u2014 content.The policy could present a \u201cnightmare\u201d scenario for foreign investors, said Alex Capri, a research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation.That\u2019s because the Biden administration has issued a series of executive orders limiting securities investments in Chinese entities that the US suspects of aiding China\u2019s military.\u201cThis represents a murky grey zone for investors, as the CCP\u2019s presence spills over into all areas, both military and civil,\u201d Capri said. \u201cAmerican and other foreign investors will struggle to perform due diligence in an opaque Chinese system.\u201dOld approach, same endThe Chinese government first introduced \u201cgolden shares\u201d in 2013 with the aim of strengthening its control over state-backed media firms, which were later opened up to private investors. But as the mobile internet took off, it took such shares in a number of private tech firms operating news and video apps to maintain its grip over information on the internet.Between 2018 and 2022, several government entities took 1% stakes in popular news and content platforms, including US-listed Sina Weibo (SINA), 36kr (KRKR), and Qutoutiao (QTT), and Hong Kong-listed Kuaishou, according to company filings or public registration records.\u201cBeijing\u2019s Golden Share initiative is about embedding the Chinese Communist Party within the nerve-centers of China\u2019s most important internet-content companies,\u201d said Capri. \u201cIt\u2019s about achieving pervasive surveillance, censorship and policing capabilities from the inside out,\u201d he added.In April 2021, a government entity acquired a 1% stake in a Beijing subsidiary of TikTok\u2019s parent company Bytedance, according to Qichacha.The subsidiary controls some Chinese operating licenses for Douyin and Toutiao. Douyin is the country\u2019s most popular short-video app with more than 600 million active users. Toutiao is a news aggregation app.Later that year, an executive at TikTok said at a US congressional hearing that TikTok had \u201cno affiliation\u201d with the Bytedance subsidiary.No easy returnBeijing has tried to arrest a rapid slowdown in the country\u2019s economy by hitting pause on the heavy-handed tech crackdown. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week that China will support the growth of the private sector, while opening its door further to foreign investment.But investors may not be so easily enticed to return to China, analysts said.The Communist Party may be easing off on fines and penalties, but the \u201cgolden shares\u201d approach seeks the same end, which is \u201ccontrol and tight oversight,\u201d said Capri.Silver pointed out that not only will government control of listed entities likely raise risks with an increasingly wary US administration, but Western institutional investors may be reluctant to invest alongside Beijing.\u201cThe risk is that shareholder interests will remain subservient to state interests,\u201d he said.",

He added that the company aims to \"make it easier for Chinese tourists to patronize local merchants\" as China reopens. Budrul Chukrut | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesTencent is expanding its presence in Singapore \u2014 and China's a big reason. The Chinese tech giant has struck new partnerships with Singapore businesses such as ride-hailing app Grab through its digital messaging app, WeChat/Weixin. \"We see Singapore as a strategic market for Weixin,\" Etienne Ng, Southeast Asia's regional director for Weixin Pay, told CNBC in an email. He added that the company aims to \"make it easier for Chinese tourists to patronize local merchants\" as China reopens. WeChat/Weixin provides instant messaging and social media services, and can function as a digital wallet. Weixin is a version of the app that targets mainland Chinese, and its separate sister app, WeChat, is its international version. The app has about 1.3 billion monthly users. In December 2022, Grab launched a \"mini-program,\" or feature, within the Weixin app which allows users to book its services across over 480 cities in Southeast Asia without having to download the Grab app separately. Grab is currently the only ride-hailing app available on the platform in Singapore. In Grab's mini-program, Chinese travelers can also choose to pay via WeChat/Weixin Pay in Chinese yuan.watch nowGrab is optimistic that Southeast Asia will benefit from the return of Chinese travelers to the region, said Shawn Heng, group head of business development at Grab, citing the company's data. \"Chinese travelers represented the largest group of non-Southeast Asian users using the Grab app in 2019,\" he added. Weixin is also working with the Singapore Tourism Board on an updated version of a mini-program called MeetSG, targeting Chinese MICE (meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions) travelers to Singapore. Cities such as Las Vegas and Hangzhou have developed similar programs with Weixin, but Singapore remains the first and only country with such an arrangement. In April last year, even the country's zoo started to use the app's livestreaming functions to engage with the Chinese audience during border closures, said Damon Wee, vice president of digital marketing at Singapore's Mandai Wildlife Group.Why SingaporeSingapore had over 3.6 million arrivals from China in 2019, making China the top tourist market for the Southeast Asian nation before the pandemic. And a full recovery to pre-pandemic levels is expected in 2024, Singapore Tourism Board's CEO Keith Tan said in a press conference in January. Singapore did not tighten travel restrictions for Chinese travelers after China announced the easing of its border controls. More broadly, the region is a promising market for Weixin: The number of active Southeast Asian merchants using Weixin's mini-programs grew by 10 times over the past two years, according to Weixin Pay's Ng.Challenges aheadTravel recovery won't be smooth sailing, however. Willy Chang, partner at Bain & Company, said a number of challenges have to be dealt with before a full recovery happens: higher air fares, supply shortages (of flights, staff and so on) and global macroeconomic headwinds.watch now",

            "description": "Computer programs have become the basis of all disruptive innovations nowadays, creating new markets and technologies that are crucial in our daily life. From using smartphone apps and doing online banking to driving a car, programming is a key skill required in any industry.To increase young people\u2019s knowledge of programming, Tencent has introduced an initiative called \u201cCoding for Youth.\u201dCoding for Youth is a program that aims to inspire interest in programming among youth. The first phase is a beginner program that opened in June 2022. More than 180,000 teenagers participated to build a digital space station, with many of them writing lines of code for the first time.In the second phase, students from more than 30 provinces across China applied for the week-long program, which inspired programming innovation in fields such as first aid science, barrier-free technology for the elderly, and space exploration. 100 students were able to make it to the next step, where they received one-on-one mentorship from 100 Tencent engineers who volunteered as mentors.There are volunteer mentors from more than 60 project teams of Tencent, including Tencent Doc, Tencent Sogou Input Method, Qzone, and so on. Here, four of our mentors discuss their feelings about getting involved in the project.Q: Why did you want to be a part of this activity?Dalong Sun, Quality Assurance Engineer, Tencent Cloud and Smart Industries Group (CSIG)I learned about this event by chance on the intranet and knew straight away that I really wanted to be a part of it. I was a new employee at Tencent and had never done anything like this before, so wanted to challenge myself to be a good mentor for someone. Being among the selected 100 engineers for the program was exciting.Marco Zhuo, Software Engineer, Tencent Platform and Content Group (PCG)My main motivation was to help improve programming skills of young people. It can help them think to solve problems, while stimulating their mind to learn. As a father, I also learned how to pass on knowledge to my own child from this experience.Rocky Pan, Software Engineer, Tencent Interactive Entertainment Group (IEG)Most people would agree that mastering a language can help advance knowledge. Well, programming is a language too. Computers and the internet are a part of daily life and work. Mastering the language of programming helps us better harness the power of computers, which is essential in the field of scientific research.Yongdong Wu, Software Developer, WXGI have been learning and working with programming for many years. I hope to use my experience and expertise to help kids explore and become interested in programming.Q: What memorable occasions and challenges arose from the program?Dalong SunI was surprised by the amount of homework given to students. I didn\u2019t expect my mentee to be still enthusiastic about programming under such intensive arrangements. To reduce the pressure on him, I put a lot of thought into the communication process and prepared four or five sets of plans to cover different scenarios. I could then immediately answer the questions he had, which ultimately improved the efficiency of our communication.Marco ZhuoI was mentoring a high school student in his second year. His knowledge of programming was stronger than I expected for someone at his age. He knew enough to create some basic programs, which was impressive. And he wanted to learn voice-related decoding of computer networks and AI-related programming.Rocky PanI was impressed by my mentee\u2019s creativity and enthusiasm for programming. He was full of ideas, and wanted to use programming to realize those ideas.Programming education in schools is fairly basic. Many students can write small pieces of code but would find it challenging to create a whole program. I helped my student analyze and model a problem, then work on it in blocks to create a complete program. A week isn\u2019t long however, so we focused on identifying and solving problems and explaining principles. A key learning was to approach problems logically and in an organized way.A mentee designs a program for Mars exploration.Q: What was your approach to mentoring students?Dalong SunBefore each session, I prepared detailed scripts about how to help him identify gaps or issues in his proposal, and ways to inspire him to solve problems by himself. When answering his questions, I introduced some high-level ideas, which helped him broaden his knowledge and understanding of the tech industry. While it might feel like an informal chat, I was already prepared for every question he asked.Marco ZhuoMy strategy was to introduce several options to him when encountering problems and we would discuss them together. It would be up to him to decide which method to choose to solve the problem. By considering the pros and cons of each option, it helps him improve his analytical and judgment skills.Yongdong WuIf you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. If you teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime. During the programming process, I guide the children to learn common debugging methods and learn to test and verify that the functionality meets expectations.Q: How does the program help young people and how do you evaluate its benefits?Dalong SunActivities focused on solving social and scientific problems allow students to use their knowledge, abilities and interests to help society. Using engineering technology for social good encourages children to better understand how they can help others in innovative ways.Rocky PanThe program can build on the basics of information technology education in schools. IT education is a very practical subject, and this program lets students apply what they have learned in theory.One-on-one guidance by frontline engineers on one hand makes it easier for the students to apply what they have learned and realize their creativity through programming. On the other, it makes them be more aware of the role technology plays in improving the quality of life for many and lets them understand what it takes to do programming.Yongdong WuThe event was very inspiring for the participants. The 1-on-1 mentoring is a great opportunity for them to get in touch with engineers who are working in the industry and to observe how engineers analyze and solve problems in the real world.The kids can realize that programming is not nebulous, but meaningful when it is actually solving problems in life.A mentee designs a program for seniors that can help them keep track of their stuff and remind them to check their heart rate.Q: How do you remain creative yourself?Dalong SunCreativity that cannot be realized is a tree without roots and water without its source. In my daily life, I try to understand all aspects of the world and learn about other industries and disciplines. When I come across new ideas, I think about how to implement them in work or life.Marco ZhuoI like to pay attention and be curious about new technologies and new things. I will also participate in more activities, whether online or offline and take part in programming competitions.Rocky PanRead more, communicate more.Q: What is your biggest learning or achievement from this activity?Dalong SunIt opened my eyes to the possibilities of technology in social applications. I also saw that younger generations are more adept at understanding technology and they use it to solve problems happening around them. It is a more natural part of their life compared to ours.Marco ZhuoI gained so much from this project. I not only taught the students some new skills, but I also learned how to better communicate with them, which was very rewarding.The project is consistent with Tencent\u2019s longstanding commitment to using technology for good. As programmers, not only are we curious about technology, but we are always thinking about how we can contribute to society and improve people\u2019s lives. For instance, I worked on programming barrier-free technology to improve typing efficiency for everyone. We have been developing and iterating on an accessible input method that meets the needs of people with disabilities.Coding for Youth: Strategic Approach to Next-generation Digital LiteracyCoding for Youth is part of a broader initiative by Tencent to improve digital literacy for the next generation. Other projects include the AI Arena Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning Competition, which challenges university students to test AI learning through games, and Tencent Coding classes that teach children in rural and remote Chinese towns how to code.",

            "description": "The Chinese multimedia company Tencent has announced via WeChat that it will be launching a new mini program on the platform called \u201cBrand Discovery\u201d, which will replace Tencent Huiju. Tencent is best known among young people for its video games but is also a news outlet, TV production company, and operates the instant messaging service WeChat.Tencent has been trying to gain a foothold in e-commerce since 2005. Since then it has launched the platforms PaiPai.com, QQ mall, and QQ shopping, as well as investing in multiple other e-commerce platforms including JD.com and Pinduoduo. Two years ago Tencent launched its e-commerce WeChat mini program, Tencent Huiju, but results were lukewarm. It gained a reputation as a program mainly useful for finding discount vouchers, rather than making purchases and many users maintained their loyalty to the e-commerce giants JD and Tmall.Mini-programs are a feature of WeChat equivalent to \u201csub-applications of the WeChat ecosystem\u201d that allow brands to set up their own miniature site within the messaging app. In this way, WeChat functions almost like an internet browser as users may search information or products via the WeChat app. Users can sign up to particular mini programs much like a subscription account, which digital influencers have utilised as way to drive engagement with their personal brands.The new Brand Discovery program represents a shift in strategy compared to traditional e-commerce platforms. Instead of offering a closed-loop system in which users can search, browse, and purchase products all without leaving the Tencent mini-program, the new program will focus on information aggregation, serving as a home base where users can search for other mini programs and receive recommendations. Users interested in further browsing or purchasing a particular brand\u2019s products will be redirected to the relevant mini program of that brand or shopping site.CEO of Tencent, Ma Huateng, has implied that Tencent are keen to capitalise on the success of short-form video content in future, perhaps using it to drive engagement with and traffic towards recommended brands on the Brand Discovery mini program.ShareJoin our newsletter",

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration Acquire Licensing RightsWASHINGTON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - China leads the world in counterfeit and pirated products, the office of U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai said in a reporton Tuesday which identified WeChat, China's most popular chat app, as \"one of the largest platforms for counterfeit goods.\"\"Counterfeit and pirated goods from China, together with transshipped goods from China to Hong Kong, accounted for 75% of the value of counterfeit and pirated goods seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection in 2021,\" the U.S. government's latest report on \"notorious markets\" added.The U.S. government identified 39 online markets and 33 physical markets that reportedly engage in or facilitate substantial trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy.\"This includes continuing to identify the WeChat e-commerce ecosystem as one of the largest platforms for counterfeit goods in China,\" it added.WeChat is China's most popular chat app with more than a billion active users and is owned by Chinese technology firm Tencent Holdings Limited (0700.HK).The report alleged WeChat provided an e-commerce ecosystem that facilitated the distribution and sale of counterfeit products to users of the overall WeChat platform.China-based online markets AliExpress, Baidu Wangpan, DHGate, Pinduoduo and Taobao also remain part of the notorious markets list, along with seven physical markets in China \"that increasingly use brick-and-mortar storefronts to support online sales of counterfeits,\" the USTR office said on Tuesday.The U.S. government added e-commerce sites operated by Tencent and Chinese tech giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (9988.HK) to its notorious markets list in early 2022.\"The Notorious Markets List is an important tool that urges the private sector and our trading partners to take action against these harmful practices,\" Tai said on Tuesday.The Chinese government said at the time it did not agree with the U.S. government's decision to include some e-commerce sites in the list, calling the action \"irresponsible.\"Tencent also said at the time it strongly disagreed with the decision and Alibaba had said it will continue working with government agencies to address concerns about intellectual property protection across its platforms.Reporting by Kanishka Singh in Washington; Editing by Josie KaoOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

In an interview with Twitch streamer The Serfs, Pearce discussed Chinese tech and media giant, Tencent.\u201cThey also have a bunch of problematic sh-t,\u201d Pearce denounced. \u201cI have a friend who had a film that was offered to be made by Tencent, or funded by Tencent, and they were like \u2018no black people!\u2019 \u2018Bigger tits!'\u201d\u201cLike, a lot of rules that they have [\u2026] that I think also has had a hand in you know, some AAA games,\u201d Pearce speculated, before hastily adding \u201cAgain I don\u2019t wanna speak on any of this because I\u2019m so worried about getting sued by Tencent.\u201d\u201cBut this is what I\u2019ve heard, rumors, not sure if any of this is true,\u201d Pearce emphasized. \u201cBut even games that are out, where they were like \u2018Yeah that character needs to have bigger tits\u2019 or \u2018You need to make her skin lighter\u2019 type s**t.\u201dRELATED: Report: The Walt Disney Company And Marvel Studios To Educate Actors In Order To Placate Communist China\u201cAgain, I know that more of the film industry, and that\u2019s outside of content that\u2019s like \u2018no ghosts!'\u201d Pearce explained, mentioning Chinese media typically banning depictions of ghosts, spirits, and the undead. \u201cThey just have weird rules like that.\u201d\u201cI think we should be way more concerned about Tencent than we should be about Microsoft,\u201d Pearce insisted, regarding their recent efforts to acquire Activision Blizzard.In a statement to The Gamer, Tencent stated \u201cThe views attributed to Tencent by Alanah Pearce are contrary to our beliefs, culture and values. At this point they are also just rumors. But we do take the matter seriously, and if it turns out someone affiliated with Tencent did in fact make such a statement we will take appropriate action.\u201dWhile state-mandated media censorship in China is well known, China has also shown outright rejection of black actors and characters. This ranges from Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and Black Adam both being denied a release in China, and the Chinese Star Wars: The Force Awakens posters reducing the size of John Boyega\u2019s Finn.Actor John Boyega also quit being the Jo Malone global ambassador, after being replaced by a Chinese actor Liu Haoran for the Chinese region.RELATED: Blizzard Entertainment To Suspend All Game Services And Sales In China Starting January 2023While Tencent allegedly rejecting black characters would make sense given how the country\u2019s censors have previously reacted, it may be a surprise that they allegedly pushed for larger chested women. Ever since the Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign of 1983, China has banned pornography.As such, fan-service is also under scrutiny. New regulations in 2021 emphasized the ban on \u201cexposure\u201d such as panty-shots, and showing prostitutes \u2014 and likely other smutty characters that act against the Communist Chinese government\u2019s values.Despite this, there are gacha games with scantily clad female characters operating in China. While typically censoring their clothing or restricting how the camera can move, they keep their physique. Though there have been incidents of characters being outright removed such as in Azur Lane.Likewise, censorship in western games from Chinese studios has been met with speculation that the developers are complying with China\u2019s policies at the expense of their own domestic fans.In October last year, Nexon announced Blue Archive would split into censored and uncensored versions \u2014 aside from the Korean and Global versions. Along with having received warnings from the Korean Game Rating and Administration Committee, the global version had previously met demands from Chinese censors.However, the allegation is muddled when looking at Tencent Pictures\u2019 filmography, particularly in joint ventures as a production company on western films. These include Kong: Skull Island, Wonder Woman, Venom, Bumblebee, Men in Black: International, Terminator: Dark Fate, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, Monster Hunter, Extinct, Moonfall, and Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre.The above feature black actors and actresses in some roles, and aren\u2019t particularly famed for having well-endowed actresses. Was Pearce\u2019s source mistaken? Or have Tencent met resistance when making similar demands in the past?NEXT: Rumor: Alleged Insider Claims Marvel Studios\u2019 Diversity Push Meant To Recoup Financial Losses From Brand\u2019s Death In China",

Tencent has since divested its stake in Tesla, and no longer holds any Tesla stock, per data compiled by Bloomberg.\"We saw a huge potential in the company, the category of EVs (electric vehicles) but also a huge amount of respect for the way Elon was driving the company,\" Wallerstein said of the 2017 investment.He added that at the time \"it wasn't so clear that they were going to survive and that EVs were going to actually survive.\"AdvertisementWallerstein's role as CXO is about \"thinking about existential global challenges facing humanity,\" he said in an interview with the World Economic Forum in October.\"And then, on the other hand, developing new approaches, often novel technologies, breakthrough technology that give us more tools as humanity to tackle these big challenges.\"Musk is currently fighting lawsuits against him by shareholders who said he manipulated Tesla stock prices through his \"funding secured\" tweet in 2018, in which he claimed the company was going private.His lawyer Alex Spiro argued in court on Thursday that Musk had simply used \"the wrong words,\" in the tweet.Advertisement\"You will come to learn very soon that this was not fraud, not even close,\" he added.",

            "description": "When Safari users in Hong Kong recently tried to load the popular code-sharing website GitLab, they received a strange warning instead: Apple\u2019s browser was blocking the site for their own safety. The access was temporarily cut off thanks to Apple\u2019s use of a Chinese corporate website blacklist, which resulted in the innocuous site being flagged as a purveyor of misinformation. Neither Tencent, the massive Chinese firm behind the web filter, nor Apple will say how or why the site was censored.The outage was publicized just ahead of the new year. On December 30, 2022, Hong Kong-based software engineer and former Apple employee Chu Ka-cheong tweeted that his web browser had blocked access to GitLab, a popular repository for open-source code. Safari\u2019s \u201csafe browsing\u201d feature greeted him with a full-page \u201cdeceptive website warning,\u201d advising that because GitLab contained dangerous \u201cunverified information,\u201d it was inaccessible. Access to GitLab was restored several days later, after the situation was brought to the company\u2019s attention.The warning screen itself came courtesy of Tencent, the mammoth Chinese internet conglomerate behind WeChat and League of Legends. The company operates the safe browsing filter for Safari users in China on Apple\u2019s behalf \u2014 and now, as the Chinese government increasingly asserts control of the territory, in Hong Kong as well.Apple spokesperson Nadine Haija would not answer questions about the GitLab incident, suggesting they be directed at Tencent, which also declined to offer responses.The episode raises thorny questions about privatized censorship done in the name of \u201csafety\u201d \u2014 questions that neither company seems interested in answering: How does Tencent decide what\u2019s blocked? Does Apple have any role? Does Apple condone Tencent\u2019s blacklist practices?\u201cThey should be responsible to their customers in Hong Kong and need to describe how they will respond to demands from the Chinese authorities to limit access to information,\u201d wrote Charlie Smith, the pseudonymous founder of GreatFire, a Chinese web censorship advocacy and watchdog group. \u201cPresumably people purchase Apple devices because they believe the company when they say that \u2018privacy is a fundamental human right\u2019. What they fail to add is *except if you are Chinese.\u201dChu tweeted that other Hong Kong residents had reported GitLab similarly blocked on their devices thanks to Tencent. \u201cWe will look into it,\u201d Apple engineer Maciej Stachowiak tweeted in response. \u201cThanks for the heads-up.\u201d But Chu, who also serves as vice president of Internet Society Hong Kong Chapter, an online rights group, said he received no further information from Apple.\u201cPresumably people purchase Apple devices because they believe the company when they say that \u2018privacy is a fundamental human right\u2019. What they fail to add is *except if you are Chinese.\u201dThe block came as a particular surprise to Chu and other Hong Kong residents because Apple originally said the Tencent blocklist would be used only for Safari users inside mainland China. According to a review of the Internet Archive, however, sometime after November 24, 2022, Apple quietly edited its Safari privacy policy to note that the Tencent blacklist would be used for devices in Hong Kong as well. (Haija, the Apple spokesperson, did not respond when asked when or why Apple expanded the use of Tencent\u2019s filter to Hong Kong.)Though mainland China has heavily censored internet access for decades, Hong Kong typically enjoyed unfettered access to the web, a freedom only recently threatened by the passage of a sweeping, repressive national security law in 2020.Silently expanding the scope of the Tencent list not only allows Apple to remain in the good graces of China \u2014 whose industrial capacity remains existentially vital to the California-based company \u2014 but also provides plausible deniability about how or why such site blocks happen.\u201cWhile unfortunately many tech companies proactively apply political and religious censorship to their mainland Chinese users, Apple may be unique among North American tech companies in proactively applying such speech restrictions to users in Hong Kong,\u201d said Jeffrey Knockel, a researcher with Citizen Lab, a digital security watchdog group at the University of Toronto.Knockel pointed out that while a company like Tencent should expected to comply with Chinese law as a matter of course, Apple has gone out of its way to do so.\u201cThe aspect which we should be surprised by and concerned about is Apple\u2019s decision to work with Tencent in the first place to filter URLs for Apple\u2019s Hong Kong users,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen other North American tech companies have resisted Hong Kong\u2019s demands to subject Hong Kong users to China-based filtering.\u201dThe block on GitLab would not be the first time Tencent deemed a foreign website \u201cdangerous\u201d for apparently ideological reasons. In 2020, attempts to visit the official website of Notepad++, a text editor app whose French developer had previously issued a statement of solidarity with Hong Kong dissidents, were blocked for users of Tencent web browsers, again citing safety.The GitLab block also wouldn\u2019t be the first time Apple, which purports to hold deep commitments to human rights, has bent the company\u2019s products to align with Chinese national pressure. In 2019, Apple was caught delisting an app Hong Kong political dissidents were using to organize; in November, users noticed the company had pushed a software update to Chinese iPhone users that significantly weakened the AirDrop feature, which protesters throughout the country had been using to spread messages on the ground.\u201cAll companies have a responsibility to respect human rights, including freedom of expression, no matter where in the world they operate,\u201d Michael Kleinman, head of Amnesty International\u2019s Silicon Valley Initiative, wrote to The Intercept. \u201cAny steps by Apple to limit freedom of expression for internet users in Hong Kong would contravene Apple\u2019s responsibility to respect human rights under the UN Guiding Principles.\u201dIn 2019, Apple publicly acknowledged that it had begun using a \u201csafe browsing\u201d database maintained by Tencent to filter the web activity of its users in China, instead of an equivalent list operated by Google. Safe browsing filters ostensibly protect users from malicious pages containing malware or spear-phishing attacks by checking the website they\u2019re trying to load against a master list of blacklisted domains.In order to make such a list work, however, at least some personal information needs to be transmitted to the company operating the filter, be it Google or Tencent. When news of Apple\u2019s use of the Tencent safe browsing list first broke, Matthew Green, a professor of cryptography at Johns Hopkins University, described it as \u201canother example of Apple making significant modifications to its privacy infrastructure, largely without publicity or announcement.\u201d\u201cI suppose the nature of having a \u2018misinformation\u2019 category is that China is going to have its own views on what that means.\u201dWhile important questions remain about exactly what information from Safari users in Hong Kong and China is ultimately transmitted to Tencent and beyond, the GitLab incident shows another troubling aspect of safe browsing: It gives a single company the ability to unilaterally censor the web under the aegis of public safety.\u201cOur concern was that outsourcing this stuff to Chinese firms seemed problematic for Apple,\u201d Green explained in an interview with The Intercept, \u201cand I suppose the nature of having a \u2018misinformation\u2019 category is that China is going to have its own views on what that means.\u201dIndeed, it\u2019s impossible to know in what sense GitLab could have possibly been considered a source of dangerous \u201cunverified information.\u201d The site is essentially an empty vessel where software developers, including corporate clients like T-Mobile and Goldman Sachs, can safely store and edit code. The Chinese government has recently cracked down on some open-source code sites similar to GitLab, where engineers from around the world are able to freely interact, collaborate, and share information. (GitLab did not respond to a request for comment.)Notably, the censorship-evasion and anonymity web browser Tor has turned to GitLab to catalog instances of Chinese state internet censorship, though there\u2019s no indication it was this activity that led to GitLab\u2019s addition to the Tencent list.While Tencent provides some public explanation of its criteria for blocking a website, its decision-making process is completely opaque, and the published censorship standards are extremely vague, including offenses like \u201cendangering national security\u201d and \u201cundermining national unity.\u201dTencent has long been scrutinized for its ties to the Chinese government, which frequently leverages state power to more closely influence or outright control nominally private firms.Earlier this month, the Financial Times reported that the Chinese government was acquiring so-called golden shares of Tencent, a privileged form of equity that\u2019s become \u201ca common tool used by the state to exert influence over private news and content companies.\u201d A 2021 New York Times report on Tencent noted the company\u2019s eagerness to cooperate with Chinese government mandates, quoting the company\u2019s president during an earnings call that year: \u201cNow I think it\u2019s important for us to understand even more about what the government is concerned about, what the society is concerned about, and be even more compliant.\u201dWhile Tencent\u2019s compliance with the Chinese national security agenda ought not to come as a surprise, Knockel of Citizen Lab says Apple\u2019s should.\u201cUltimately I don\u2019t think it really matters exactly how GitLab came to be blocked by Tencent\u2019s Safe Browsing,\u201d he said. \u201cTencent\u2019s blocking of GitLab for Safari users underscores that Apple\u2019s subjection of Hong Kong users to screening via a China-based company is problematic not only in principle but also in practice.\u201dUpdate: January 28, 2023An earlier version of this story referred to Chu Ka-cheong by his given name instead of his surname. The references have been updated.",

            "description": "A cosplay fan poses for a photo at a Tencent Games booth during the China Digital Entertainment Expo and Conference, also known as ChinaJoy, in Shanghai, China July 30, 2021. (Reuters)HONG KONG--China\u2019s end to a sweeping crackdown on its video games market is expected to breathe life back into the battered industry this year, but remaining restrictions on some content and economic headwinds will limit the extent of the recovery.Beijing\u2019s tough curbs in 2021 laid waste to the once-booming industry, shaving over half of the market value of sector leaders like Tencent Holdings and NetEase Inc and shrinking the world\u2019s biggest gaming market for the first time.Shares of Tencent, the world\u2019s largest gaming company, and NetEase rose this week after China\u2019s video games regulator granted the first gaming licenses in 2023, the latest sign that the clampdown is ending.Analysts expect China to approve between 800 and 900 games this year, potentially more, topping the 512 titles released in 2022 and 755 in 2022. Between August 2021 and March 2022, no titles were approved.\u201cWe believe the approvals indicate a more benign regulatory environment for the China gaming industry,\u201d JP Morgan analysts wrote in a note on Wednesday. \u201cWith rich game supply, we are more positive on overall online game market growth during Chinese New Year, a traditional strong season for the China online game market.\u201dThe crackdown was aimed at curbing gaming addiction among youth and purging content the government did not approve of, with companies asked to delete content that was violent, deemed to celebrate wealth or foster the worship of celebrities.That sent game sales in China tumbling more than 10% to 269.5 billion yuan ($40.1 billion) in 2022, the first decline since figures became available in 2003, according to a report by CNG, a government-backed industry data firm.In November last year, Tencent, the world\u2019s biggest gaming company, reported its domestic gaming revenue shrank 7% in the third quarter. Its overall gaming revenue fell 4.45%.Shares of Tencent, China\u2019s most valuable company, dropped 24.7% in 2022 but have risen 21% so far this year, recouping nearly all of last year\u2019s losses. NetEase\u2019s Hong Kong stock, which dropped 27.3% in 2022, is up 21.4% this year.Tencent and NetEase did not respond to request for comment.REGULATORY THAWAlso providing investors some cause for hope are the larger budgets of the games now being approved, a sign publishers are willing to invest more in the improving regulatory environment.Since December, titles such as Tencent\u2019s Valorant, NetEase\u2019s Justice Mobile and miHoYo\u2019s Honkai: Star Rail have been granted licenses, the biggest ticket items since August 2021.In December, Chinese regulators approved 44 foreign games, the first to be given the green light in 18 months and widely seen as the last regulatory hurdle to be removed, inspiring hope for foreign developers to re-enter China again.Citi analysts said if approval announcements normalize further, more games will potentially be approved than their current forecast of between 800 and 900 licenses.\u201cAmong the gaming studios, we see higher upside risks on game revenue rebound for Tencent,\u201d they added.That said, some regulatory restrictions imposed by Beijing are here to stay. Most notably, in September 2021, China banned under-18s from playing games for more than three hours a week, a rule that has forced Tencent and its peers to give up targeting youth gamers.Tencent said in November the total time under-18s spent on its games had plunged 92%.For the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday, Tencent and NetEase have implemented rules to limit under-18s from playing games for more hours than legally allowed, in line with recent practice for other major holidays.Strict control on game content will also remain, barring popular but violent games such as Grand Theft Auto from entering China.Whether the gaming market can return to form also depends on the recovery of the Chinese economy, which has been thumped by a surge in COVID infections.Citi analysts said the unprecedented game sales decline last year was also likely due to mobile gamers remaining \u201cmore price-sensitive on discretionary entertainment spending amid a weak\u201d macro-economic environment.However, data shows China\u2019s total gamer population remains stable, slipping just 0.33% in 2022 from 2021 to 664 million.\u201cIn 2023, China\u2019s online gaming will get back to growth, but (it won\u2019t be) huge at all,\u201d Chenyu Cui, an analyst at research firm Omdia said. \u201cGrowth will be slow and gradual.\u201d",

            "description": "William_PotterMany people have called China uninvestable for the last year and a half, yet this sentiment has changed in recent weeks. In October, I wrote my previous article about Prosus (OTCPK:PROSF) and Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY); since then, Prosus shares have gained more than 70% from the lows. Let's see what changed this sentiment and if it still provides an attractive opportunity.China is reopeningSince the pandemic's start, China has held onto its Zero Covid policy. This worked fine for a while, but eventually, this policy evolved into a subhuman treatment of civilians, with people starting to starve under the strict lockdown policy. Finally, Zero Covid stopped to work and in April, the first spike happened, with 36,000 new cases in one day at the peak. The second and so far the last peak was at the end of November with 71000 cases in one day. Over 2 million people have gotten Covid in China so far. Around the same time, China started to open up again and now even the borders are reopened by air, land, and sea.China covid cases (Google)China's Central bank ends the tech crackdownAnother, maybe even more important, piece of news for Tencent is that a central bank official declared the two-year crackdown on technology companies to be over. This is taking the stress away from the companies that have been in the crosshairs of regulators for two years and have seen share prices cut in half and worse in some cases.In September, Tencent and NetEase (NTES) were allowed to publish new games after a 14-month break. This should enable Tencent to return to being a growing company, unlike in the recent past: In the last two quarters, Tencent saw its first decline in revenue on a trailing twelve-month basis. Since the peak at $88.36 billion, revenues declined to $77.84 billion in the most recent quarter.Tencent's Q3 2022 earningsLet's look at the last earnings report for Tencent. Results have been pretty steady year over year but up across the board sequentially. The operating margin stabilized at 29% after dropping to 23% in Q4 21. A lot of this has been achieved by efficiency initiatives (Slide 7):Marketing programs -> reduced S&M expenses by 32%Business services -> strategic focus on high-quality revenueVideo accounts -> operating costs per view reduced significantlyWorkforce optimization -> reduced headcountQ3 earnings update (Tencent Investor Relations)Tencent continues to return capital, benefitting ProsusIn my last article, I mentioned that there were rumors about Tencent looking to sell down more of its investments to return capital to owners. This ended up happening in Q3, when Tencent announced the divestiture of its entire stake in Chinese Food delivery and super app company Meituan (OTCPK:MPNGF), valued at $13.3 billion at the time of the announcement. Additionally, the company accelerated its buybacks to $3 billion in the last 12 months. Previously, Tencent used to dilute shareholders with Stock-based compensation (SBC), adding $18.56 billion in SBC over the last decade. The $3 billion buyback still is insignificant compared to its market cap, which bottomed at $240 billion and is now back at $447 billion, but it is a good allocation of Tencent's capital.Tencent buybacks (Koyfin)What does this mean for Prosus?Prosus is a big beneficiary of the new capital return strategy of Tencent. I already talked about this in my first article last February, where I concluded that the company will have to change its capital allocation strategy and will return more to shareholders. This does not interest me as much as a company that can invest its money efficiently, but Prosus can benefit from this due to its discount to net asset value (NAV). Prosus will receive around 262 million shares in Meituan, which are currently worth about $5.7 billion. They already stated that they intend to sell them as soon as they receive the special dividend. This frees up more cash for Prosus to use in its buyback strategy to exploit its discount to NAV. I explained how this strategy works in this previous article, but in short: Prosus is selling shares of Tencent to repurchase its own shares. Because Prosus trades at a discount to its NAV, every repurchased share increases the NAV per share, thus unlocking value for shareholders.Prosus NAV strategy (Prosus investor day)How large is the discount to NAV now?In my opinion, the investment thesis for Prosus revolves around its discount to NAV and its ability to repurchase shares. According to Prosus NAV calculation, updated daily, the company currently has a NAV of 160.9 \u20ac billion for the whole company and 1307 million shares, equating to 113.3 \u20ac NAV per share. When the mass buybacks were announced, the company had 1420 million shares outstanding, so we have already seen a sizable 8% decline in the share count with around $3.3 billion spent on buybacks. Shares currently trade at 75 \u20ac and offer a 33% discount to NAV.Is Tencent still cheap?If we look at historical multiples, we can see that Tencent, after its rally, is now trading at a 23 PE, 17 EV/EBITDA, and a 4.2% FCF yield. These multiples are still below historical averages, but analysts expect a more modest growth rate than the last decade. I believe Tencent is around fair value but not a big bargain anymore.Tencent valuation (Koyfin)ConclusionI sold out of Prosus last August at a 33% gain. In hindsight, not my best decision; shares have run up another 22% since then. I sold out at a gain to lock in profits in a still uncertain environment. I still am not a fan of investments in China due to the regulatory uncertainties and at these prices, which are closer to fair value than before, I am personally not looking to invest. I'll leave Prosus at a buy, though, because the discount to NAV is still attractive at 33% and Tencent is not overvalued right now. We must also remember that Prosus can buy back around 4% of its shares from the special dividend (Meituan). Overall, I am not excited about China, but I see Prosus as a decent way to get exposure to the market.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The company\u2019s media portfolio includes businesses such as streaming platform Youku and mobile browser UC Web. A new director who shares the name of a CAC official was appointed that same day, records showed, confirming a Financial Times report.Chinese state organs have for years invested billions of dollars into high-profile private start-ups, from Didi Global to billionaire Jack Ma\u2019s Ant Group. In recent years, as Beijing clamped down on every sphere of the Internet, official agencies have also taken nominal stakes of typically 1 per cent \u2013 a golden share that in theory allows Beijing to nominate directors or sway and veto important company decisions. TikTok owner ByteDance and Weibo are among the major Internet firms to have disclosed that sort of arrangement.The fund vehicle that bought into Alibaba is backed by the CAC along with prominent state firms such as Citic, China Post and China Mobile, the database showed. Discussions are also under way about a government entity taking a similar stake in Tencent, the FT reported, citing people involved in the matter.The discussions are emerging as Beijing prepares to loosen its grip on the world\u2019s largest Internet arena and move past a bruising crackdown that has enveloped almost every Internet sphere for well over a year. Signs are growing that President Xi Jinping\u2019s administration, keen to revive the world\u2019s No. 2 economy, is reversing course on campaigns against gaming addiction and preparing to unfetter firms such as Alibaba that drew government scrutiny.\u201cTo me, the news is slightly positive,\u201d said Mr Banny Lam, head of research at CEB International Investment. \u201cThe two have been struggling with the issues of crackdown in recent years. For both Alibaba and Tencent, the government stake could potentially help them to get the green light to do business in new areas and lower the risks of further clampdown by the regulators.\u201dTencent dipped more than 2 per cent, while Alibaba was down as much as 1.6 per cent in a largely unchanged Hong Kong market.A Tencent spokesman declined to comment, while an Alibaba spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.

            "description": "In 2022, we forecasted the technological uptake and advancements that will build the future. There has been progress across major axes of computing, from visualization to AI and new types of processors.So what does 2023 hold in store for us? To what might we look forward?For the third year running, Tencent has collaborated with hundreds of in-house and independent scientists, engineers, academics and other experts to determine the most important cutting-edge innovations that will shape the world.In a report titled \u201cTop 10 Digital Technology Application Trends 2023,\u201d our panel of experts map four main technical spheres covering:The reshaping of IT fundamentals such as computing, storage, architecture, and security.The intelligent world and its elements including AI and robots.Digital-real interaction such as mixed reality (XR), digital humans, and digital twins.The future network including 5G and 6G, Web3, and the Internet of Things.Within these spheres, the report identifies 10 tech developments to watch globally, ones that have the potential to drive deep social and economic development and change.1. High-Performance Computing (HPC) Goes Next LevelComputing power has grown exponentially over the decades, with tiny chips now able to process mind-boggling amounts of information at unimaginable speed. There is more to come, with the emergence of supercomputers that could turbocharge processor capabilities even further. These HPCs are hybrid systems that combine classic and quantum computing systems and allow for complex problems to be calculated and resolved at extremely high speeds.HPCs can lead to scientific and technological breakthroughs that will benefit society, including the development of AI applications such as large language models, AI-generated content, autonomous driving and protein structure prediction, which rely on sophisticated deep-learning systems that require huge processing power.2. Ubiquitous Computing Speeds up the Integration of Humans, Machines and ThingsComputers need operating systems to function. Without the critical layer of system software, your computer becomes useless. It\u2019s not just servers, desktop and laptop computers that use operating systems, smartphones do too. The problem is, different operating systems aren\u2019t always compatible, which means that apps and files, for example, may not always work on different devices.As more of our lives move online, however, we are entering the era of the Internet of Things (IoT). Increasingly connected products and applications such as smart home appliances, lighting, wearable tech, and autonomous cars are accelerating the development of ubiquitous operating systems (UOS) that can be used across a variety of devices. Ubiquitous computing allows us to manage and control a large number of devices from a single point, such as our smartphone, making life easier for users.3. Cloud Computing Adapts to User NeedsWe spend a lot of time in the cloud these days, livestreaming videos, playing games, storing photos, and conducting business. Cloud technology is also critical in helping industries from entertainment to auto-transform and remain competitive.As demands on cloud services grow, so too do their capabilities and sophistication. Advances in technologies such as AI, big data, and digital twins can improve effectiveness and efficiency, enabling richer cloud-native services that are more refined, heterogenous and better able to be responsive to and meet the needs of different users.4. Spatiotemporal AI Keeps Cities on the MoveCities around the world are growing bigger and more complex, posing challenges to governments and planners. Spatiotemporal AI can help by collecting and analyzing data across space and time to predict conditions and changes in such complex environments.For example, spatiotemporal data can be used to model multiple scenarios at any given moment around transport, public health and safety, crowds, energy use, climate risks and more. It can help smart cities use the technology to realize efficient supply and demand matching of facilities and services.According to Michael Batty, Fellow of the Royal Academy of Sciences, it has the potential to increase our understanding of how, where, and why we locate and move in cities. It also helps us design and manage the cities of the future to be more sustainable, equitable and efficient.5. The Software-Defined Energy Networks Make Grids More EfficientEnergy sources and prices came under sustained pressure globally in 2022, making the advent of software-defined energy networks (SDEN) timely. As the name suggests, SDEN use software, often remotely, to manage and control energy supply, distribution, storage and security. It does so by deploying sensors, actuators and other hardware to measure energy consumption and production, along with the cloud, AI and big data to manage distribution.Digitalizing energy networks provide greater flexibility and efficiency in the allocation of scarce resources, allowing for energy levels to be distributed in a timely and responsive manner according to supply and demand.SDENs are also an important tool in the incorporation of renewable energy into the electric power grid, using software to achieve grid balance and paving the way for energy systems that are more sustainable and less reliant on fossil fuels.6. Web3 Opens UpThe concept of Web3 may have been in the news recently for the wrong reasons due to volatility in the cryptocurrency and NFT markets, but expect to see continued interest in its applications moving forward.Web3 is an evolution of the internet to a decentralized, blockchain-based system. It has been used for trading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin on platforms such as Ethereum, but its wider use to build a digital economy has been hampered by privacy and scalability issues.Breakthroughs in the development of software applications by different companies to verify transactions while protecting fundamental privacy, however, address those problems. Efficiencies in verification also help improve the ability to significantly scale up the number of transactions per second, encouraging greater use of Web3 beyond crypto.7. Robots Develop a Sense of TouchTactile perception is a major focus of research in the field of robotics. As one of the five forms of perception, the sense of touch plays an important role in a robot\u2019s understanding of its working environment and its characteristics. Such intelligent perception and human-computer interaction is essential for robots to perform complex real tasks in unstructured settings such as homes.Innovations in flexible materials, flexible electronic technology and machine learning algorithms are expected to lead to greatly improved spatial recognition and accuracy of tactile sensors in the next one to three years. Benefits will flow on to the remote operation of industrial robots, medical surgical robots, simulation training, and space exploration, with the next-generation of interactive, virtual reality prosthesis already in development.8. Digital Humans Learn to Interact with Real OnesDigital humans were once the stuff of science fiction movies, but their reality is closer than ever. In fact, they are already widely used in digital marketing and entertainment, albeit mostly in non-interactive forms.And they are getting more advanced, with digital humans in a period of rapid development. In recent years, light field scanning, AI and other technologies have made them more intelligent, with \u201cbrains\u201d that allow for sophisticated interaction with real humans. This has the potential to make them applicable beyond gaming, in fields such as tourism, sales and marketing, information and education, and more.9. Digital Offices Spur CollaborationThe pandemic might have brought about the rise of work from home and remote working, but as much of the world returns to normal, the practice is here to stay. According to market intelligence company IDC, 70 percent of the world\u2019s 2,000 largest companies will have some form of remote or hybrid office-first work model by 2023.Companies must have secure and fully functioning digital workplaces that employees can access remotely. This includes cloud platforms, email, messaging, audio and video channels, and other business applications. These help promote the development of digital office collaboration through multimodal means and facilitate collaboration in design, R&D, production, and management.10. Industrial Security Becomes IntegratedCybersecurity is a priority for companies and organizations today. The wide application of digital technology across various industries requires the implementation of rigorous infrastructure security, data security, digital industry chain security, and network security measures.One solution is to provide one-stop, integrated protection using AI, big data, privacy technology and other new concepts to solve emerging security concerns.",

            "description": "Areas in Hangzhou and Shenzhen, home to China\u2019s biggest enterprises such as Alibaba Group Holding Tencent Holdings , and Huawei Technologies Co , once seemed impervious to the troubles that have plagued the broader housing market in China over the last couple of years.A wave of job cuts among China\u2019s giant technology companies has sent the home market reeling in neighbourhoods where waves of tech professionals \u2013 flush with high salaries and housing perks \u2013 drove prices upwards in recent years.When Linda Wu, a product manager working at Alibaba, moved to Hangzhou several months ago, she was surprised to hear an agent press her to buy a house near her office at a \u201cvery low price\u201d, rather than renting. The agent presented it as a \u201cgolden time\u201d to buy, because many people who lost their jobs were unable to pay their mortgages and were putting their homes on sale at low prices.For example, proximity to Alibaba\u2019s headquarters made Future Science Town in Hangzhou\u2019s Yuhang district a property hotspot in the city in recent years, despite its location 45 minutes by subway from the city centre.Staff members walk near Alibaba Group Holding\u2019s headquarters in Hangzhou, in China\u2019s eastern Zhejiang province on May 27, 2022. Photo: AFPBut home prices have plunged in the area since June, linked to massive lay-offs at Alibaba, which let about 10,000 employees go in the second quarter, according to financial reports.Second-hand home prices in Yuhang district dropped by about 15,000 yuan (US$2,150) in the last several months, two local agents told the Post, citing the job cuts as one factor.Home prices in one prime neighbourhood once hit 83,000 yuan per square metre, but the figure fell nearly 28 per cent to 60,000 yuan in 2022, according to a local agent website.Meanwhile, the volume of second-hand homes listed for sale on one property-agent website increased for the ninth consecutive month in September.Social-media posts also back up the trend, with laid-off technology professionals lamenting their inability to keep paying for their homes.In addition to Yuhang, areas such as Beijing\u2019s Zhongguancun in Haidian district and Shenzhen\u2019s Nanshan district have had relatively high housing prices in recent years, said Jinfeng Shi, an analyst at Credit Suisse. \u201cBut we can see those once hot areas cooled down [in 2022].\u201dIn Shenzhen, home to Tencent and Huawei, residential home transactions dropped nearly by half in 2022 compared with 2021, said Alan Cheng, Centaline Property Agency\u2019s CEO for southern China and general manager in Shenzhen, who blamed the overall downturn in the economy as well as the slowdown among technology companies.Tencent cut some 7,300 jobs between April and September.Over the past two decades, the booming technology sector brought these cities rapid industrial development, huge economic growth and an influx of white-collar workers with high salaries, Shi said.The ranks of professionals in the software and information technology sector swelled to 8.08 million in 2021, with the yearly average salary hitting 200,000 yuan, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics.11:05 China housing: Can the world\u2019s biggest housing market boom again? China housing: Can the world\u2019s biggest housing market boom again?Well-paid workers flocked to the cities and settled down where the big companies are located.\u201cMany senior colleagues who earned good salaries over the past decade like Nanshan district as a home destination,\u201d said Nicole Bai, a Tencent employee. \u201cThere are a batch of reputable schools, good hospitals, and definitely, very close to their workplaces.\u201dMeanwhile, technology companies provided their staff members with various housing benefits. A plan rolled out by Tencent in 2021 offered interest-free loans of up to 900,000 yuan for eligible employees to buy first homes locally. Its peers including Alibaba and Huawei have provided similar perks, such as low-price flats and discounts on home purchases.\u201cAll these factors made these relatively wealthy professionals a major force of consumption, and pushed up local housing prices over the years,\u201d Shi said.Indeed, the percentage of Chinese citizens wanting to buy a home fell to 16.1 per cent in the fourth quarter in 2022, a 10 per cent drop compared with the third quarter, according to a People\u2019s Bank of China survey released in late December.Now even tech professionals are part of that change.\u201cAt this time point, the uncertain career prospect makes us dare not think about purchasing a home,\u201d Bai said.The so-called middle-class group will review their personal balance sheets and their need for an expensive home, said Credit Suisse\u2019s Shi. \u201cThey might change their consumption behaviours and investment strategies.\u201dFor example, the Hangzhou agent who talked about a \u201cgolden\u201d time to buy failed to convince Wu. \u201cI had considered buying a home in Hangzhou,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now I would think twice, because you never know if you will lose your job tomorrow.\u201dThe frosty market will take time to thaw, despite a series of supportive measures rolled out in recent weeks, Shi said. \u201cThe turning point may take place in the second or third quarter, with the policies gradually playing their role afterwards,\u201d he said.",

            "description": "India, as one of the world's fastest-growing economies, grapples with the urgent need to mitigate the impacts of climate change, a pressing concern to be addressed at COP28. The country's ambitious plans to decrease GDP emissions intensity by 45 percent by 2030 from 2005 levels are intricately linked with sustaining robust economic growth. Forecasted to reach Rs 301.75 trillion ($3.69 trillion) in 2023-24, India strives to achieve a $5 trillion economy by FY2025. India\u2019s Ambition However, these aspirations necessitate substantial investments, particularly in the renewable energy sector, aligning with India's goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2070. Such a transition demands significant funding\u2014approximately $10.1 trillion between 2022 and 2060, a figure that escalates to $3.4 trillion if the net-zero targets are advanced to 2050. India's commitment to net-zero emissions could potentially boost its economy by 4.7 percent above projected baseline growth by 2036, equating to a remarkable $371 billion. The shift toward renewable energy not only enhances economic prospects but also fosters environmental sustainability, potentially reducing air pollution and creating jobs within the clean energy sector. As India progresses toward expanding its renewable energy capacity, aiming for 500 gigawatts (GW) by 2030, it stands at the forefront globally. India ranked fourth globally in renewable power capacity, boasting 163GW of installed energy, while having the world\u2019s largest renewables auction market with over 38GW of solar and wind energy projects auctioned in 2022. Besides, with over $20 billion of investments in 2022, India became the third-largest investor in the renewable energy sector globally. Despite these strides, challenges persist, limiting renewable energy's contribution to overall power generation, currently hovering around 14 percent. The Renewables Challenge Moreover, irrespective of the global downtrend in renewable costs over the past decade, the world grapples with challenges in the speed of renewable deployment, infrastructure readiness, funding levels, and the inclusivity of this transition \u2013 all falling short of the demands outlined by the 1.5\u00b0C pathway. In response to this concern, the Energy Transition Working Group, led by India during its G20 presidency, has pinpointed \u201clow-cost finance for the energy transition\u201d as one of its top six priorities. Within the G20 discussions, particular attention was given to the worldwide escalation in interest rates, significantly impacting the expenses related to capital and debt financing for renewable energy projects, notably in developing nations. This surge has heightened the costs of climate-focused bonds and bank support for sustainable initiatives. Macro-level crises, such as pandemic shocks, supply chain disruptions, and the Ukraine conflict have spiked food and energy costs, prompting global interest rate hikes to curb inflation. This impacts renewable energy progress, especially in India and the Global South. Overcoming this demands stakeholder collaboration, innovative frameworks, and private capital leveraging through blended finance. Addressing climate risks can improve access to low-cost capital. India's advocacy for this in COP28 is pivotal, vital for scaling up green technologies like hydrogen and energy storage. The Carbon Capture Route India faces a critical challenge in its renewable energy journey under its coal policy. Relying on coal for 70 percent of electricity, India sees it as crucial due to poverty alleviation and rising electricity needs. Advocating for a gradual reduction rather than an abrupt removal, India emphasises \u201cnational circumstances\u201d in COP28, balancing economic growth with environmental goals. Moving toward ultra-supercritical coal (USC) power (a more efficient technique that uses less coal for producing the same amount of energy), India aims to phase-out, decrease carbon emissions, and pursue eco-friendly alternatives. Yet, to align with net-zero targets, India should prioritise carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS) tech to further reduce its carbon footprint. However, India's pursuit of its climate goals via ultra-supercritical coal power hinges on deploying CCUS technology. CCUS can potentially capture 90 percent of the CO2 emissions and securely store it underground, making it compatible with the Paris Agreement goals. But CCS remains underutilised and financially challenging, adding extra costs and complexities to coal power facilities. However, this challenge can be addressed by leveraging its existing partnerships and platforms such as International Solar Alliance, the Mission Innovation global initiative, and the Clean Energy Ministerial in the G20. Moreover, by showcasing its own initiatives in a CCUS project in Talcher while pitching for CCUS support, India can demonstrate its leadership and commitment to climate action, while ensuring its energy security and economic growth in the COP28. Thus, India's stance at COP28 bridges economic growth with climate action, urging investments in renewables for net-zero targets. While balancing coal with a gradual reduction strategy, it can also push for CCUS tech for sustainable progress. Advocating low-cost financing, India has led to climate action, securing energy and environmental goals globally. Manish Vaid is Junior Fellow, Observer Research Foundation.

            "description": "With a fast-growing digital economy, Southeast Asia is ripe with business opportunities for public cloud suppliers, many of which have been adding new datacentres in the region to capture a bigger slice of the market.The major US hyperscalers \u2013 Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud \u2013 have expanded their footprint in the region in recent years, alongside Chinese players such as Alibaba Cloud, Huawei Cloud and Tencent Cloud.While all of them offer a swathe of services, they tend to tout their respective strengths in areas like machine learning, databases and industry-specific offerings in their go-to-market strategies.Take Tencent Cloud, for example. The company was recently recognised by Gartner as a niche player in the market for cloud infrastructure and platforms, leveraging its expertise in media and communications.In media streaming, Tencent Cloud offers application programming interfaces (APIs) that it claims will help developers build streaming applications quickly. Additionally, it provides transcoding services to help them save bandwidth and storage costs, said Poshu Yeung, senior vice-president of Tencent Cloud\u2019s international business.Known for its WeChat messaging app, Tencent also offers an enterprise communications platform called WeCom, which sports office automation and team collaboration capabilities. Yeung said this would enable businesses to use WeChat as an enterprise tool to manage their communications and business workflows, such as expense approvals.While playing to its strengths in cloud platform services, which can deliver better margins than infrastructure services, Tencent Cloud is also guiding enterprises in their cloud journey.Yeung contended that many organisations tend to use a raft of \u201cbasic\u201d infrastructure components and databases to build their applications, adding that Tencent Cloud was working with them to identify the right cloud services to deploy based on their needs.There are also opportunities around hybrid cloud as organisations seek to better control costs and mitigate risks with a hybrid deployment model. \u201cThis is happening quite often these days in the financial industry and other industries, which, for various reasons, want to have on-premise deployments,\u201d Yeung said.To that, Yeung pointed to Tencent\u2019s private cloud offering called TStack, an OpenStack-based platform that includes virtualisation, compute and open source Kubernetes (K8s) capabilities. It works with both x86 and Arm architectures and offers open APIs for multicloud and hybrid cloud management.There\u2019s also Tencent Cloud Enterprise (TCE), another private cloud platform based on Tencent\u2019s own cloud infrastructure and platform services. Yeung said the company was working with partners in and outside of China on TCE deployments to support organisations that are looking to deploy their own proprietary cloud.Whether those capabilities will help Tencent Cloud gain an edge over rivals remains to be seen. The company remains optimistic about its growth prospects in the region, however, and has added new availability zones in Singapore, Jakarta and Bangkok in the past two years.\u201cSoutheast Asia is our fastest-growing region where we are seeing high double- to triple-digit growth,\u201d Yeung said. \u201cBesides using Singapore as a hub, we also have local teams in Thailand, Indonesia and other parts of the region.\u201dIn April 2021, Tencent Cloud opened a new datacentre in Jakarta to reduce network latency for local enterprises while providing backbone access for major Indonesian and global internet service providers through its border gateway protocol that covers the entire country.Its Southeast Asian customers include Indonesia\u2019s Bank Neo Commerce, a digital bank that is using the Tencent Distributed Database for its core systems, and Singapore\u2019s NTUC Income, an insurer that is using Tencent\u2019s facial recognition technology to facilitate know-your-customer (KYC) processes.Tencent Cloud\u2019s share of the global cloud market in the second quarter of 2022 stood at 3%, behind Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Alibaba, according to market data from Synergy Research.",

            "description": "A week after Tencent\u2019s co-founder Pony Ma emphasized that short video is key to the tech giant\u2019s future, the company\u2019s short video service WeChat Channels announced that it is set to charge e-commerce merchants a 1% to 5% commission fee in the coming year, according to a report by local media outlet Tech Planet.Why it matters: Tencent\u2019s rebounding profit growth in the July-September period after four consecutive quarters of decline is a sign of the company\u2019s gains from its ongoing cost-cutting measures, but finding new revenue streams remains a priority. With 800 million monthly active users, WeChat Channels (a TikTok-like short video platform within the messaging app) provides a clear monetization opportunity.Tencent recorded its first-ever quarterly revenue decline of 3% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2022 and a 2% decline in the following quarter. Weak online advertising revenue was the main factor dragging down the company\u2019s growth.Details: The total value of live commerce sales generated from WeChat\u2019s short video platform is between RMB 40 billion to RMB 50 billion ($57.5 billion to $71.9 billion), a service provider close to the unit told Tech Planet.The report said Tencent\u2019s short video platform will charge different service fees based on different categories, with the highest rate of 5% applying to personal care, underwear, sports and outdoors, baby and maternity, and home and kitchen.Tencent is offering new merchants preferential policies, with the commission reduced to 1% for transactions of RMB 1 million or less during the first 30 days.TikTok\u2019s sister app Douyin has been charging 1% to 10% for technical services fees since February 2020, while rival Kuaishou requires merchants to pay 5% of the actual transaction value of an order.Context: Tencent has seen users\u2019 total time spent on WeChat Channels exceed 80% of the time spent on WeChat Moments (the app\u2019s friend feed). The total number of viewers of video on the platform increased by 200% compared to the same period last year, the firm\u2019s President Martin Lau said on the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call.WeChat\u2019s video unit set up a live-commerce team last July, with its daily transaction value reportedly reaching RMB 100 million for the first time in September.In addition to the emerging role of the e-commerce business, video account ads are also being regarded as a major way for Tencent to expand its revenue. Lau said he expected quarterly revenue from in-feed ads to surpass RMB 1 billion in the fourth quarter.WeChat has launched a variety of advertising formats for businesses, including WeChat Moment ads on users\u2019 friend feeds, official account ads, mini-program ads, video account ads, and search ads, with two to five options in each format.",

            "description": "Shares in Naspers and Prosus surged by almost 5% on Wednesday after the companies announced an update on their open-ended repurchase programme, through which they are offloading Tencent shares.The programme, announced on 27 June 2021, is aimed at \u201cefficiently\u201d unlocking immediate value for shareholders and increasing NAV [net asset value] per share over time.In essence, the buyback programme allows Naspers-Prosus to fund other businesses (mostly startups, although the group said it has adapted to the new market realities by setting higher targets for M&A returns) around the world through dividends from Tencent, which suffered declining revenue for two consecutive quarters last year.Prosus currently has a 26.9% stake in Tencent, down from 28.8% (worth about $128-billion) in June 2022.\u2018Committed\u2019 to TencentOn 23 November, during the diversified media and technology group\u2019s interim results announcement, CEO Bob van Dijk said they had invested heavily in some of their divisions and offloaded risky stakes in others, but were \u201cabsolutely committed\u201d to remaining a very large shareholder in Tencent for a long time to come.He said they were accelerating their path to profitability and that repurchasing their own stock was a \u201cgreat use\u201d of their capital: \u201cInvesting in Tencent and our own e-commerce portfolio at a 40% discount significantly improves NAV per share and creates permanent value that will compound over time.\u201d Van Dijk said $15-billion of value had been created on announcement of the programme.Earlier in November, Reuters reported that Tencent had planned to distribute $20-billion of stock in meal delivery giant Meituan in 2023, which triggered a selloff of Chinese internet stocks as investors feared more divestments by the online gaming business were in the offing.The Chinese government cracked down on local tech giants last year for anti-competitive behaviour, which hit tech stocks hard, wiping billions of dollars off the value of giants including Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent, with the companies posting their slowest growth yet.The Reuters report suggested the JD Group and Meituan dividends were likely to be aimed at buying goodwill with the Chinese government.In effect, the Meituan plan meant a R100-billion boost for Naspers.Naspers had already disposed of the JD Group in June last year, raising $3.7-billion from the sale.But on Wednesday, Bloomberg reported Chinese shares were off to a strong start in 2023, as fears of isolationist policies gave way to signs that China was turning more investor-friendly.The MSCI China Index rose 5.3% since trading resumed on Tuesday, marking the best start to any year since 2009, after losing nearly 24% in 2022, the Bloomberg report said, noting bullishly that China was looking like an \u201cinvestor darling\u201d once again.\u2018Rough year\u2019On 6 December, during a Prosus and Naspers capital markets day presentation, chief investment officer Ervin Tu admitted that 2022 had been a \u201crough year\u201d for the group and they weren\u2019t satisfied with the profitability of the portfolio.\u201cNow at the moment, given the level of uncertainty risk we see in the market, the fact that private valuations haven\u2019t yet corrected\u2026 and the level of discount we still see to our underlying NAV, we are opting to keep the bar high on investments and are shifting capital from our Tencent-funded buyback to manage our share count.\u201cA number of [tech] sectors over the course of the last year [are in a messy] downward trajectory\u2026 The valuation downdraft has hurt us everywhere.\u201dTu said they weren\u2019t satisfied: since 2008 \u2013 and not including Tencent \u2013 they invested $32-billion of gross capital, returned $11.3-billion and produced an 8% internal rate of return, which is 1.3 times multiple of investment capital (the ratio between the initial capital investment and the current market value of the asset) compared with 20% of recent years.Visit Daily Maverick\u2019s home page for more news, analysis and investigations\u201cWe\u2019ve been hit hard by the public market downturn and significant multiple contraction for high growth unprofitable businesses.\u201dThe focus, therefore, is on regaining profitability, through the earnings performances of its businesses.On Wednesday, in an update to shareholders, Naspers and Prosus said they would continue selling a small number of Tencent shares held by the Prosus group on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.A total of 24,801,128 Prosus shares have been sold, worth around R24.07-billion (or $1.37-billion), which have been applied to fund the Naspers repurchase programme.The 193,433,800 Tencent shares sold are worth about HK$56.68-billion (R121.6-billion) to the group.

            "description": "Simply sign up to the ESG investing myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.Foreign investors in Chinese equities have a problem. China\u2019s growth offers the hope of big returns over the coming decade, but on environmental, social and governance ratings, its companies rank lower not only than western nations, but also below most emerging markets.The combination of the world\u2019s biggest consumer market with fast-growing technology and services sectors has attracted global investors willing to look the other way on censorship, surveillance, environmental, labour and other human rights abuses.However, there are signs an ESG reckoning is looming for Chinese companies and those investing in them. ESG ratings are increasingly important for international investors, but the sustainability rules and standards common in western jurisdictions are at odds with realities on the ground in China.In a move signalling the challenge ahead, Sustainalytics, a sustainable rating agency owned by research house Morningstar, in October downgraded three Chinese tech darlings on its watchlist \u2014 Tencent, Weibo and Baidu \u2014 to the category of \u201cnon-compliant with UN principles\u201d.\u201cIt seemed to our team that internet censorship in China was increasing \u2014 Tencent, Baidu and Weibo are playing a significant part in that,\u201d Simon MacMahon, global head of ESG research at Sustainalytics, told the Financial Times.\u201cThere was evidence of censorship and surveillance related to religion, related to LGBT rights, to the war in Ukraine, to Covid-19,\u201d MacMahon said. \u201cThe scope and scale of the censorship and surveillance appeared to be increasing.\u201dIn the case of Tencent, the internet group has 1.3bn monthly active accounts held by individuals and businesses and its WeChat super app is considered indispensable for navigating daily life across not just messaging but also shopping, banking, taxis, food delivery and paying for utilities.Its shares have been hammered over the past 18 months by concerns about Beijing\u2019s regulatory crackdown on the tech sector. But the company still accounts for a sizeable chunk of foreign institutional investors\u2019 China portfolios, and Sustainalytics\u2019s downgrade shocked some ESG-focused investors.Liqian Ren, who manages China investments at WisdomTree Asset Management, a US-based fund, said she was among those obliged to drop the companies, a move that resulted in a turnover of more than a quarter of its main China index.\u201c[If the companies] become non-compliant, by our process we have to sell \u2014 unless we just don\u2019t claim this fund as ESG,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big part of the portfolio. But on the other hand, this is indeed an area that people do care about . . . and the whole point of ESG is people taking a stance on some issues.\u201dSuch experiences may become more common for investors in an increasingly authoritarian China as Xi Jinping, the country\u2019s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, embarks on an unprecedented third term in power. Some have already been debating whether China is too risky given the unpredictability of Xi\u2019s administration in recent years.Some experts have said that the trend towards a greater role for ESG in investment decisions has weakened in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, amid complaints that sustainability considerations have fuelled the rise in energy costs and inhibited resource development.However, Fitch, the ratings group, believes the hit to ESG has been a \u201cshort-term reaction to challenging conditions\u201d and that the longer term outlook remains for increased allocation of public and private capital to sustainability initiatives.Demand for ESG rating services is booming. Sustainalytics reported revenue of $76.8mn in the first nine months of the year, up 36 per cent year on year.And while scrutiny of Chinese companies is intensifying, the ESG reckoning is embroiling multinationals and posing questions for their investors too.Hong Kong Watch, a UK-based group that researches investment and human rights issues in China, said in a report in November that many of the biggest asset management, state pension and sovereign wealth funds were passively invested in companies allegedly involved in the repression of Uyghur Muslims in north-west China\u2019s Xinjiang region.The report found three major stock indices provided by index publisher MSCI include at least 13 companies that have allegedly used forced labour or have profited from China\u2019s construction of internment camps and surveillance apparatus in Xinjiang.MSCI said the only filters for inclusion in its global indices were \u201caccessibility and investability\u201d and that it had other ESG-focused indices.Foxconn, which makes iPhones and other devices for Apple, was among the companies Hong Kong Watch said allegedly used Uyghur workers obtained through state-sponsored transfers.The Taiwan-based company denied the allegations and in a response to the FT said researchers had been inconsistent in analysing their operations. It said that in response to forced labour allegations in recent months, it had submitted proprietary documents and information to Sustainalytics and to MSCI\u2019s in-house research group.\u201cDespite reviewing the same information, each returned with opposite assessments in November 2022 about Foxconn\u2019s ESG efforts,\u201d the company said.Human rights experts are unlikely to accept such denials because China has severed access to Xinjiang, making due diligence on them near impossible.Chinese companies are also less likely to engage on ESG issues than western counterparts, researchers and investors said. About 60 per cent of the companies Sustainalytics rates respond to its queries, but in China, the number is \u201cquite a bit lower\u201d, MacMahon said.While tech groups have been a focus in 2022, the auto sector appears likely to attract increasing attention heading into 2023.In December, Sheffield Hallam University\u2019s Helena Kennedy Centre released the results of a six-month investigation into links between western car brands and human rights abuses of Uyghur Muslims.The researchers said they had documented engagement with forced labour transfer programmes by 38 companies involved in the supply chain for western auto brands. The companies were involved in sectors across mining, processing, and manufacturing, they said.\u201cThe auto industry cannot wait another day to trace their supply chains back to the raw materials. To do anything short of full tracing would be an enormous legal, ethical, and reputational risk,\u201d said Laura Murphy, lead researcher.",

            "description": "Tencent CEO Ma Huateng, also known as Pony Ma, had harsh words for his employees at a town hall meeting last week, attacking them for inefficiency, laziness and a lack of attentiveness to cost-cutting.\u201cYou can\u2019t even survive as a business, yet you\u2019re chilling on the weekends, playing ball,\u201d Ma told his employees, reports Bloomberg.The harsh words come at the end of a tough year-and-a-half for Tencent, the world\u2019s largest video-game developer.Tencent is one of China\u2019s largest tech companies, owning the ubiquitous WeChat platform used for messaging and payments throughout the country. It is also the developer behind some of the world\u2019s most popular games, like smartphone game Honor of Kings, and has one of the industry\u2019s largest investment portfolios, with stakes in Fortnite developer Epic Games and Elden Ring developer FromSoftware (among many others).In his town hall, Ma criticized almost every part of Tencent\u2019s giant business. He accused the company\u2019s gaming division of focusing on quantity over quality, and complained about the company\u2019s social media products losing ground to competitors like Bytedance\u2019s Douyin.He suggested Tencent was too focused on expansion rather than focusing on its core businesses. \u201cWhat we added was just fat, and we were still unable to defeat others,\u201d he said, reports the South China Morning Post.Ma even warned that longstanding services, like Tencent\u2019s news portal, could be shut down. \u201cIf they still have a lot of problems, then their time is limited,\u201d he said, according to the South China Morning Post.The Tencent CEO\u2019s only kind words were for the company\u2019s short video service, offered through the WeChat platform, which he reportedly described as the \"hope\" for Tencent.Tencent did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Game over?Tencent\u2019s troubles began last summer when Chinese authorities ordered strict playtime limits for children. Minors were allowed to play for just three hours each week in a bid to prevent gaming addiction. Regulators also reportedly told gaming companies, like Tencent and its competitor NetEase, to clamp down on content censors deemed \u201cobscene and violent,\u201d such as \u201cmoney-worship and effeminacy.\u201dStory continuesBeijing then blocked Tencent from releasing a new video game for 15 months, denying the company\u2019s products the approval needed for release in China. The pause upended Tencent\u2019s plans to release blockbuster games like Fortnite in the country. (Beijing finally approved a small health-focused game from a Tencent subsidiary in September, ending the drought.)There may be some light at the end of the tunnel for Tencent. In late November, a research firm affiliated with China\u2019s gaming regulator stated that China\u2019s problem with gaming addiction had \u201cachieved a step toward resolution,\u201d implying that the gaming crackdown may be coming to a close, according to CNBC.Yet Tencent now faces a slowing gaming market, both domestically and globally. Gaming sales skyrocketed during the COVID pandemic as customers stayed home due to social distancing, but a move to post-COVID life and a slowing economy are dragging down revenues across the industry.Tencent reported $19.7 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter, a 2% decrease year-on-year. Shares in Tencent are down 57.7% from their peak in Feb. 2021.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune:People who skipped their COVID vaccine are at higher risk of traffic incidentsElon Musk says getting booed by Dave Chapelle fans 'was a first for me in real life' suggesting he's aware of building backlashGen Z and young millennials have found a new way to afford luxury handbags and watches\u2014living with mom and dadMeghan Markle\u2019s real sin that the British public can\u2019t forgive\u2013and Americans can\u2019t understand",

            "description": "(Yicai Global) Dec. 23 -- Tencent will put more emphasis on its TikTok-like platform Channels as video clips are eroding the amount of time people spend watching long-form videos and playing games, the chief executive officer of the world's largest gaming firm said recently.The growing popularity of short videos among users is prompting Tencent to adjust its business strategy, Pony Ma, who is also founder and chairman, said in a speech at an employee conference last week which began to circulate on social media yesterday.Tencent has done a lot to integrate videos with online retail and expects to bring Channels closer to transactions and achieve an e-commerce closed loop, he added.The online version of Ma\u2019s speech is accurate, a company insider told Yicai Global. President Liu Chiping also talked about cutting costs and improving efficiency at the conference, he said.Channels is becoming a very important part of Shenzhen-based Tencent\u2019s business and will develop into a good source of profit if it can generate enough liquidity, Liu said previously.Tencent hopes to expand its gaming business, which accounts for more than half of its total revenue, by working with more partners, exploring more international markets and focusing on developing high-quality games so as to make the most out of its gaming licenses, Ma said.The tech giant\u2019s revenue fell in the first two quarters on lower income from video gaming and online advertising, but it managed to stage a comeback in the third quarter, posting a 4.5 gain quarter on quarter to CNY140.1 billion (USD20 billion). The firm is on track to log profit growth this quarter, industry insiders say.Ma issued a stern warning to unprofitable business segments. The Platform and Content Group, which comprises the firm\u2019s news aggregator Tencent News, underwent a big shake-up this year, shedding many staff.\u201cWhen people said to me that the logo on top of Tencent\u2019s headquarters is that of its instant messaging service QQ, how can Tencent possibly cut its news business, I said it is possible,\u201d Ma said. \u201cIf the business cannot take full responsibility for its profits and losses and continues to lose money and have other problems, there will be not much time left for Tencent News.\u201dMany of Tencent\u2019s employees told Yicai Global that they agreed with what Ma said. \u201cHis speech pointed out directions for the firm\u2019s future development,\u201d one said. \u201cThe boss has got the key point, which means he has his finger on the pulse,\u201d another said. \u201cIf you follow Tencent\u2019s employee conference every year, you\u2019ll know Pony Ma talks straight.\u201dBut some people think Ma is taking action on the development direction of the firm\u2019s business groups too slowly.Editor: Kim Taylor",

Here are some of the recent projects initiated by the platform in hands with different communities and people with physical disabilities.A Job-matching Mini program for People with DisabilitiesGuijie Feng graduated in electronic information engineering from Shenzhen University with good grades. He displayed strong technical skills, yet when applying for jobs, was rejected for positions that he was qualified to fill due to hearing impairment.After failing to get the job, Feng decided to join a company that tailors technology to help people with visual impairment. He believed that people with disabilities commonly face discrimination when seeking employment and that he can help people like him by overcoming the challenges with technology.Qiming, the company he joined, developed a Weixin mini program that helps them read and access information, and partake in activities such as online shopping and finding jobs. It also functions as a virtual community for the blind, where people share their experience of the job-seeking process and post advice and tips for finding employment.The founder, Jiangnan Zhou, was inspired to set up the company after growing up with his father who had a disability. He and Feng created another mini program called \u201cSilkworm House\u201d which its name is a homonym of \u201ccommunity for the disabled\u201d in Chinese. The platform assists people with different impairments, including visual, hearing and other physical challenges.Feng and his teammates develop technologies for people with visual impairment.\u201cWe want to build a platform similar to LinkedIn, but serve the disabled, with a barrier-free optimization framework built in,\u201d says Zhou. Using Tencent\u2019s AI-based text recognition library, it is optimized to meet international accessibility standards that recognize text and content with icons.Helping HandsThe mini program helps people with hearing impairment in doing job interviews online. It converts the interviewer\u2019s speech into text to help the interviewee read what is being said and type a response. Where more help is needed, a sign language service can be provided remotely and in real time.Zhou hires people with physical disabilities to work on AI picture annotations for sign language. They label digital images used for machine learning at home on computers or mobile phones.Zhou chose to create a mini program instead of a standalone app because mini programs are much simpler and cheaper to develop. It can also take advantage of Weixin\u2019s vast ecosystem. Its ease of use, high efficiency, and low cost have connected developers, organizations, and institutions for social good.The Silkworm House project team.Launched in September with a test group of more than 100 people with disabilities, the Silkworm House\u201d is expected to make it easier for some 85 million people with physical disabilities to find jobs.\u201cThe Silkworm House project hopes to better serve the disabled groups to live a better lifestyle through technology and create social value,\u201d the CEO said.Encouraging People with Disabilities to Work in TechTong Zhou is responsible for running the Weixin Official Accounts at Mind Interaction. The company, where a third of its employees with disabilities, specializes in mobile games and entertainment platforms for the blind.To allow people with visual impairment to read the blog posts, it\u2019s important for the team to make the interface simple enough to be recognized by screen-reading software, which converts text into audio.Zhou is responsible for running the Weixin Official Accounts at Mind Interaction.\u201cI\u2019ve always loved working on tech products,\u201d says Zhou Tong, adding: \u201cI hope more social media tools can be optimized for barrier-free access, and the visually impaired can find opportunities to develop them.\u201dBarrier-free TechnologyWhen developing accessible products, Tencent closely collaborates with people like Rui Zheng, who grew up with a visual impairment and now works for the Shenzhen Information Accessibility Research Association.He is a user experience expert who evaluates online products like apps, looking for gaps and making suggestions to improve barrier-free functions. He helps employees at tech companies better understand the needs of people with disabilities when designing more inclusive products.Zheng Rui attends an event to introduce barrier-free technologies.For example, when Weixin launched its popular red envelopes to celebrate the spring festival, it was difficult for the visually impaired to take part because their phones were unable to read the content of Weixin red envelopes. Fortunately, Zheng Rui raised this issue with Weixin so that it was quickly fixed.He also helped blind users access Weixin payments using a PIN code, while ensuring the security of their personal information.",

            "description": "Over the past year, all eyes may be on Tencent's continuous acquisition and investment in the global gaming market, but behind the scene, its overseas game publishing business is picking up steam.Most recently,\"Goddess of Victory: Nikke\", published by Level Infinite, Tencent's international publishing label, is causing a stir in the global mobile game market.The game, which combines hit elements such as voluptuous anime female characters, hardcore sci-fi settings, adrenaline-pumping shooters, and addictive gacha mechanics, topped the App Store and Google Play in several regions, including North America, Korea and Japan, shortly after its launch on Nov. 4. It is currently rated 4.3 stars out of 5 on Google Play in the US with over 300,000 reviews.\u201cWhat makes Goddess of Victory: Nikke unique is the dual strategies of being a shooter built around a collectible card game. The game is easy to play on the go, with intuitive controls and a variety of gameplay styles, including puzzle solving and co-op battles,\u201d IGN introduced.According to report from data intelligence firm Sensor Tower, the game generated more than $100 million revenue in its first month of release, A whopping 43.3% of the game's total revenue comes from Japan, followed by South Korea with 27.2% and the US with 15.2%.By comparison, Genshin Impact, the hit open-world role-playing game, earned $245 million in its first month, with $125 million of that coming from outside China.Screenshot of \"Goddess of Victory: Nikke\"While the success of the release is largely due to the dedicated work of its developer, South Korean studio Shift Up, it might not have happened without the support of Level infinite.Officially launched last Dec., Level Infinite is tasked with helping Tencent move beyond its role as a game developer and become a major player in global game distribution.With dual headquarters in Amsterdam and Singapore, it provides studio support and services, ranging from technical and production assistance, \u201cGames as a Service\u201d (GaaS) and local/global market insight and analysis, as well as assistance with esports integration and international publishing.It's no secret that Tencent wants a bigger slice of the international game publishing market. Even before setting up Level Infinite, the world's largest game company was using its global reach to drive regional marketing and publishing initiatives that most studios and developers would have struggled to do on their own. At the time, the business was operating under the \"Tencent Games Global\" brand.For instance, it assisted New Zealand-based Grinding Gear Games in promoting its tittle Path of Exile in the North American market through influencer partnerships, PR and community resources.Level Infinite\u2019s launch represents the next stage in Tencent Games\u2019 evolution as a global publisher and trusted brand, according to Liu Ming, Global CEO of Tencent Games. \"We look forward to bringing gamers high-quality titles wherever and however they play,\u201d the executive said.Also, the name Level Infinite downplays its connection to the parent company, suggesting that the business not only serves Tencent-owned studios, but also hopes to attract more third-party developers.In order to expand its influence in the global distribution field, Tencent hired game marketing veteran Zoran Rosso as Marketing Director of both Tencent Games Global and Level Infinite in Nov. last year. Prior to joining Tencent, Roso held marketing roles at Activision Blizzard, Sony and Take-Two and has been a prominent figure in the German gaming industry for the past 20 years.In October, Level Infinite made its first major third-party game publish, that is, \"Tower of Fantasy,\" a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed by Chinese company Perfect World. During its first month of worldwide release, \u201cTower of Fantasy\u201d presented gratifying figures, earning over $44 million.As Levels Infinite expands its footprints in the global publishing landscape, Tencent can move closer to its target of reducing its reliance on the domestic market and growing its revenue from abroad. Previously, Tencent Games unveiled that it hoped that 50% of its revenue would come from games published overseas.More effort and time will be needed to reach this goal. In the third quarter of 2022, Tencent's revenue came in at about 140 billion yuan ($20.1 billion), down 2% year-on-year. Domestic game revenue accounted for 22% of total sales, and international game revenue accounted for 9%, thus, game revenue from overseas contributes about 29% to the entire game sector.With assistance from \u201cGoddess of Victory: Nikke\u201d, overseas sales of Tencent's mobile game offerings have gone up by 12.5%, Sensor Tower\u2019s data showed. The brand-new tittle was the highest-grossing title published by Tencent in Nov., equaling twice the international sales of runner-up, \"Call of Duty\".Overseas sales of Tencent's mobile game offerings have gone up by 12.5%, Sensor Tower\u2019s data showed.Speaking about Tencent Games' strategy and growth at GamesBeat Summit 2022, Liu Ming, global CEO of the department, said: \"Our vision for our global games business is to build a global ecosystem that integrates gaming, developing and publishing systems by closely connecting, and aligning the development and publishing functions\".According to a Korean media Money Today Network report on Dec. 19, Tencent has acquired a 20% stake in Shift Up, becoming the second largest shareholder of the studio after founder Kim Hyung-tae.",

The sources declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue.The meeting was first reported by Chinese local media outlet Jiemian.Tencent reported a second straight quarterly revenue drop last month as China's economic slowdown and regulatory scrutiny hit its ad and gaming businesses.Up to the previous quarter, Tencent had reported double-digit growth for almost every three-month reporting period since going public in 2004.Ma, who mostly stays out of public view, also said the company needed to focus on short video for future growth, and described the WeChat Video Account, Tencent\u2019s short video platform, as the \"hope\" of the Shenzhen-based company, the sources said.He warned that the video gaming business group would have to get used to Beijing\u2019s strict licensing regime, and the number of new games China would approve would remain limited in the long run.Reporting by Josh Ye; Editing by Anne Marie Roantree and Stephen CoatesOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

It is also a global leader in invention and technology investment with prominence in fintech, cloud services, digital communications (it has its own free messaging and calling app, WeChat, known as Weixin in China) and its own Netflix-like streaming platform, Tencent Video. Tencent\u2019s Interactive Entertainment Group (IEG) is responsible for developing the interactive entertainment side of the company\u2019s business, including games and esports.Jia Wang (above) explains that Tencent seesthe metaverse as part of \u201chyper-digital reality,\u201da concept that integrates the digital world withreality to create a blended experience, which willallow people to connect more deeply with the virtualworld.(Photo: Courtesy of Tencent)Jia Wang, a veteran leader in data science and engineering within the interactive entertainment industry, recently sat down with WIPO Magazine to share her views on the future of the video games industry and the role that intellectual property (IP) plays in her daily work. Jia Wang is Deputy Director of the Technology Service Center at Tencent\u2019s office in Palo Alto, California, USA.Tell us about your role in Tencent games?I am the Deputy Director of the Technology Service Center for the North Americas Team, which is part of Tencent\u2019s Interactive Entertainment Group. My team works on advanced technologies like AI, big data and cloud capabilities. Our role is to optimize gaming experiences and ensure that everything works smoothly so players can enjoy their games.How did you get into gaming?My first encounter with video games came during my undergraduate studies in computer science. One of my first projects was to create a game. But my passion for games only really took off when I joined King, the creators of Candy Crush, where I worked as a data scientist with a really creative group in their Stockholm office. Now, I can't imagine working in any other sector. Working on games is a lot of fun, both professionally and socially. I work with a great team, and we bring a lot of joy to people's lives.What challenges have you faced as a woman in the games industry?Women in all sectors face many challenges. In the games industry we are definitely in the minority. Thankfully, that\u2019s changing. At Tencent America, there are many women in leadership positions and there\u2019s a strong sense that women can be successful here. The company\u2019s commitment to diversity and inclusion is one of the reasons it\u2019s such a great place to work. The good thing about this industry is that it requires many different skill sets, with roles for designers, creators, product and project managers, developers, data scientists and more. That creates a lot of opportunity for everyone. In 2020, recognizing the need to \u201cwalk the talk,\u201d at Tencent America, we set up our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Group. It works to reinforce these values within the company and is raising awareness of the unconscious biases we all have.How do you see the global video games landscape evolving?The video games landscape is changing very rapidly thanks to the new technologies that are coming on stream. In the early years, people played games on a console or on a PC. Video games really took off when smartphones and other portable devices entered the market. That, and the launch of the free-to-play model, really boosted the popularity of games and fueled growth. These days, technologies like augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming the way people interact with technology and creating opportunities for more immersive playing experiences. That, in turn, is creating opportunities for game studios to develop more innovative and creative game play for people to enjoy. It also means they are publishing their games on multiple platforms. And that\u2019s great news for players!\u201cA lot of investment is going into developing technologies to embed a \u201creal world feeling\u201d into the virtual world so people develop stronger emotional connections with it and have a better game experience,\u201d Jia Wang explains. (Photo: EvgeniyShkolenko / iStock / Getty Images Plus)How do you think the industry is going to evolve?The games industry will continue to evolve because, as technologies improve, we can do interesting new things. Every player wants to find a game they like, which is driving innovation and the development of new game genres as new audiences enter the games universe. The focus today is better understanding our audiences to deliver the games they want. We really are living in the \u201cgolden age\u201d of video games. The industry is booming thanks to good stories, new gameplay and next-generation technologies. And there is a great deal more to come.We really are living in the \u2018golden age\u2019 of video games [\u2026] And there is a great deal more to come.Tencent partners with many companies around the world, and our aim is to create a global gaming universe that supports their success. And that's important to me because, while gaming is a shiny industry, it creates many job opportunities and is a major source of entertainment for hundreds of millions of people. It also has huge potential to foster the development of innovative and creative solutions in other areas of social need.And what of the metaverse?Although there\u2019s a huge buzz around what many call the metaverse, it's not yet clear what it is or how it will evolve. At Tencent, we see it as part of \u201chyper-digital reality,\u201d a concept that integrates the digital world with reality to create a blended experience. It will offer people real-time immersive experiences and will allow them to connect more deeply with the virtual world and to switch seamlessly between the virtual and the real world. It will spark people's imagination and push the boundaries of possibility. I can see a whole new creative landscape emerging. It\u2019s very exciting.What role do AI and machine learning play in the games industry?AI and machine learning are used in various ways. For example, they make it a lot easier for artists to create landscapes more quickly. They also enable us to inject more realism into animations by ensuring the movements of the characters we create are life-like. A lot of investment is going into developing technologies to embed a \u201creal world feeling\u201d into the virtual world so people develop stronger emotional connections with it and have a better game experience. As mentioned, my team is working on advanced technologies like AI, big data and cloud capabilities and we\u2019re super excited to bring these to the global market and to help other game studios, including new market entrants, realize their dreams.What role do games have beyond pure entertainment?There's a lot of innovative work in this area. Game technologies are also being used to develop a variety of small apps for social impact. For instance, video games are an effective way of preserving historical and cultural artifacts and making them accessible to everyone. In 2018, Tencent developed a super cool 3-D AI technology that reconstitutes old architectural structures, like the Great Wall of China, enabling users to explore these structures in their original, pristine form. The level of detail they can achieve is amazing.Tech for Good\u201d is a central ethos across the Tencent universe.Other applications are being developed for use in healthcare settings. A recent example is an intelligent eye test that screens for ocular disease in children. It was developed by LightSpeed Studios, a leading Tencent game studio, in partnership with the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center (ZOC) at Sun Yat-sen University in China. In the test, the children watch a two-minute video, which engages them on a mission to save baby turtles. The engaging storyline requires them to focus their eyes on the spotlight that searches for turtle eggs. The test is completed in less than five minutes, is 90 percent faster than traditional eye tests, and offers the children a lesson in environmental protection.How long does it take to develop a game and what makes a successful game?From a design perspective, a successful game enables people to start playing without having to pay anything. At some point in the game, they will be given an option to buy into the game, or to unlock gameplay, but it\u2019s their choice whether they do so.It can take years to develop and launch a successful game.In our games, we often offer \u201cskins\u201d \u2500 a graphic download that players can buy to change the appearance of a character in a game. What people generally don't realize is that producing one of these beautiful \u201cskins\u201d is an expensive and long creative process that can the take up to a year to produce.What role does IP play in your daily work?Tencent is strongly committed to IP and recognizes its enabling role in generating a more vibrant, creative, and innovative ecosystem for games and other areas of our business. A game is both a creative and a technical product and IP protects both aspects. There\u2019s a lot of IP involved in the games we develop, from the technical mechanisms that enable and enrich the user\u2019s experience to the storyline and the heroes we create.Game development involves working with many different partners. Each is responsible for creating different elements of the game industry. My team understands that we need to be switched on to IP because it represents an important business interest for the company and our partners. We have clear guidance on what we need to do and when. We ensure our partners know that, while protecting our IP is a priority, we recognize they also need to protect their work. When discussing a project, we always clarify the IP boundaries to ensure we don\u2019t overstep the mark. It\u2019s a reflex. It ensures everyone\u2019s IP rights are respected. But it\u2019s important to balance the need for IP protection with the need to support the creative process because bouncing ideas around together sparks still more creativity.Within Tencent, there is a shared understanding of the importance of IP to our business.What is your message to young people who want to get into the industry?Follow your passion. The game industry is full of passion, and there are many fun people with the same dream. Most people work for their paycheck but at Tencent many more are working to make their dreams come true.Related Links",

After completing the real-name authentication, they can post their medicine needs to the platform.On the premise of meeting their own medication needs, users can also choose \"I have more medicines,\" and fill in relevant information and real-name authentication, to help meet the needs of fellow users.Multiple local governments have advocated neighborhood mutual assistance and drug sharing. Everyone should purchase urgently needed daily medicines in a rational, appropriate way and share excess medicines like antipyretics and other anti-epidemic materials with those who really need them.Chinese officials have also been stepping up efforts to secure supply.At a press conference on Tuesday, the National Medical Products Administration said that it has increased support for the market supply of medications related to the epidemic, including guiding pharmaceutical companies to conduct research in accordance with regulations and expand production capacity in an orderly manner.Wuhan, capital of Central China's Hubei Province, began to release 3 million ibuprofen tablets each day for a week from Saturday, while Jinan, capital of East China's Shandong province, announced that 1.1 million ibuprofen tablets have been released to the market.In Beijing, where infection numbers have spiked, the local drug administration and other authorities have sent joint working groups of more than 50 people to five large pharmaceutical wholesale enterprises in the Chinese capital, cooperating to alleviate the current shortage of epidemic prevention drugs.Global Times",

            "description": "Govs. Brian Kemp of Georgia and Chris Sununu of New Hampshire on Thursday immediately banned the use of TikTok and popular messaging applications from all computer devices controlled by their state governments, saying the Chinese government may be able to access users\u2019 personal information.Both Republican governors banned the messaging app WeChat and other apps owned by Chinese firm Tencent. Sununu went further, banning apps owned by Chinese firm Alibaba and telecommunications hardware and smartphones made by Chinese firms including Huawei and ZTE.Kemp also banned Telegram, saying its Russian control poses similar risks.\u201cThe state of Georgia has a responsibility to prevent any attempt to access and infiltrate its secure data and sensitive information by foreign adversaries such as the CCP,\u201d Kemp wrote in a memo, using an acronym for the Chinese Communist Party. \u201cAs such, it is our duty to take action to preserve the safety and security of our state against the CCP, entities it controls and other foreign cyberthreats.\u201dSununu said the ban \u201cwill help preserve the safety, security, and privacy of the citizens of New Hampshire.\u201dKemp cited comments by FBI Director Chris Wray earlier this month that China could use the app to collect data on its users that could be used for spying operations.Sununu ordered state agencies to remove any prohibited software or hardware within 30 days.Kemp and Sununu are among at least 14 governors to take such an action, part of a wave that also includes calls for Congress to ban the use of the programs from federal government computers.Some agencies swiftly took action. Within an hour, Georgia\u2019s Department of Transportation posted a farewell video on TikTok to its 2,834 followers, saying \u201cFollow us on Instagram, we will no longer be posting to TikTok! Thank you all for the engagement.\u201d The department had posted more than 80 videos since October 2021.Andrew Isenhour, a spokesperson for Kemp, said guidelines to be issued by the Georgia Technology Authority later Thursday would include exceptions that would allow law enforcement agencies and prosecutors to access the platforms with special permission.The ban will not apply to Georgia public universities, Isenhour said. Many of which use TikTok to court potential new students and communicate with current students and athletic fans.Other states that have issued bans including Alabama, Idaho, Iowa, Maryland, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas and Utah.The U.S. Senate passed a bill in 2020 to ban TikTok, but it never passed the House. Other bills to regulate or ban TikTok and other apps are also pending in Congress. The U.S. armed forces have prohibited the app on military devices.Critics say they fear the Chinese government is gaining access to critical information through the application and could be using it to spread misinformation or propaganda.While there has been much debate about whether the Chinese government is actively collecting TikTok data, observers say TikTok would have to comply with any potential requests from Chinese security and intelligence requests to hand over data because the company\u2019s owner ByteDance, is a Chinese company.ByteDance moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2020.TikTok spokesperson Jamal Brown told The Associated Press earlier this month that the bans \u201care largely fueled by misinformation about our company.\u201dTikTok Chief Operating Officer Vanessa Pappas, based in Los Angeles, has said the company protects all American users\u2019 data and that Chinese government officials have no access to it.Former President Donald Trump issued blanket orders against Chinese tech companies that sought to block new users from downloading WeChat and TikTok in 2020, but lost in court. President Joe Biden has taken a narrower approach, ordering a Commerce Department review of security concerns. U.S. officials and the company are now in talks over a possible agreement that would resolve American security concerns.A researcher with the conservative Heritage Foundation last month called on government officials to ban TikTok from operating entirely in the United States. But some other experts say the threat is overstated and that China gains little advantage from TikTok information that isn\u2019t publicly available.",

Let\u2019s take a closer look and find out.QQ Different Dimension Me: Tencent Anime AI explainedA technology powered by the artificial intelligence called Different Dimension Me turns photos of you, your friend, or even a meme into anime versions. When the tool, which made its debut on the Tencent QQ platform in November 2022, allowed users to create animated representations of themselves or their preferred non-anime characters, it soon went viral.The platform QQ, which has its roots in China, is comparable to WhatsApp or WeChat.Many believe that the generator makes use of the Stable Diffusion AI model, albeit this is unproven.Online users all over the world are rapidly embracing this AI tool.

Following that, several blogs and influencers started to offer tutorials for devoted users. However, the finished version isn\u2019t always enough. The result could be unexpected as the image becomes more complex, particularly when AI is unsure of or perplexed by some people or objects. At the time of writing, This AI-generated content (AIGC) tool has been charged with racial bias due to flawed algorithms and image recognition capabilities.However, it is a technical flaw, and we don\u2019t think QQ Different Dimension Me is created this way initially.

            "description": "Internet companies need to do their part to protect the safety and well-being of young gamers, Tencent Senior Legal Counsel Yan Perng said in a recent panel discussion at the Family Online Safety Institute (FOSI) 2022 Annual Conference in Washington, D.C.Tencent Senior Legal Counsel Yan Perng (second from the left) discusses Tencent\u2019s approach to healthy games at the FOSI 2022.Speaking as part of a session titled \u201cMindful Approaches to Online Gaming,\u201d Perng added that online games can serve both goals to educate and entertain young players.\u201cMindfulness is embodied in Tencent\u2019s strong culture of compliance,\u201d she said. \u201cIn video games, mindfulness involves paying attention to how our decisions may affect user safety and wellbeing, and making the conscious choice to shape happy, positive gameplay experiences.\u201dThe panel also included Arana Shapiro, Managing Director and Chief Learning Officer at Games for Change, and Pat Vance, President of the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB).\u201cAt Tencent, we actively participate in FOSI\u2019s work, obtain ESRB certifications and support UNICEF to make games safer,\u201d Perng continued. \u201cWhen it comes to developing and promoting online games, Tencent considers not only legal and regulatory requirements, but also how games reflect company values and local community needs.\u201dFor example, Tencent\u2019s community codes of conduct, management of chat features to ensure safe communications between adults and children, age gates and other safeguards demonstrate how much Tencent cares about the health, safety and wellbeing of its players.Tencent, along with many FOSI Conference participants, emphasized the importance of safety by design. U.S. Federal Trade Commission Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya said good privacy protections and the best interest of children should be considered in new-game design. He pointed approvingly to the California Age-Appropriate Design Code Act.Perng cited Riot Games for doing \u201csome pretty great work in this area. Riot Games used a new game design discipline called Player Dynamics to create a more rewarding social experience while avoiding harmful interactions. In October, they launched the \u2018Designing for Digital Thriving\u2019 challenge to encourage the design of healthy, inclusive digital spaces that enable individuals and communities to thrive.\u201dThe challenge was open to professional games designers and developers as well as academics, community managers, educators, innovators, students and others. They had until December 1, 2022, to present their designs for \u201cBuilding a Future for Kids and Families,\u201d \u201cFostering Healthy and Resilient Digital Spaces\u201d and \u201cDesigning for Marginalized Voices.\u201dDuring this year\u2019s panel, Pat Vance pointed out that over 75 percent of video game players are people over 18, underscoring the truly wide range of people who enjoy video games. Panel members also highlighted the role video games played during the pandemic in fostering social connections. Arana Shapiro discussed ways games foster life skills and reminded the audience that games can serve a serious purpose while also being enjoyable. Minecraft Education is a prime example.Games are not only for entertainment, but also could be used for education. Tencent develops serious games, including Carbon Island (a mini-game that simulates the path of \"Carbon Peaking - Carbon Neutral\", and contained knowledge of emission reduction, low-carbon concepts and carbon sequestration means), See (for people to experience the life of visually impaired people), Sky Shadow (a game developed for visually impaired individuals), Pavlov: Brain\u2019it On (a Cognitive training game that helps players of all ages improve their attention span, information processing speed, working memory, inductive reasoning and spatial cognition.)This was not the first time Tencent participated in a FOSI panel. Tencent General Counsel and President of Tencent America Brent Irvin noted during FOSI\u2019s 2020 Annual Conference that the company is committed to providing tools to promote healthy gameplay. He supported a more standardized global approach to protecting young people online, something that participants at this year\u2019s conference discussed as well.During the conference, FOSI released a 2022 research report entitled \u201cMaking Sense of Age Assurance: Enabling Safer Online Experiences,\u201d which found that parents like verification mechanisms involving texts or apps. More than two-thirds of parents and children in the U.S. and UK are open to using a biometric component to verify age. Tencent is open to various solutions and best practices, as long as they ensure both privacy and age verification are addressed.Online gaming is an extremely positive experience for most players. According to National Institutes of Health research, video game play can improve cognitive skills. Meanwhile, an Oxford University study found no causal relationship between video games and mental health, but noted that quality \u2013 not quantity \u2013 of gameplay may be relevant, which underscores the importance of effective game design.",

            "description": "WASHINGTON, Dec 8 (Reuters) - The Biden administration on Thursday moved to block Microsoft's (MSFT.O) $69 billion bid to buy \"Call of Duty\" maker Activision Blizzard , throwing a stumbling block in front of the tech giant's plans to rapidly expand its portfolio of popular games and catch up to bigger rivals.Microsoft, which owns the Xbox console and game network platform, said in January 2022 that it would buy Activision for $68.7 billion in the biggest gaming industry deal in history.Without Activision and its variety of games across mobile, consoles and PCs, Microsoft could struggle to attract users to its budding subscription service for accessing games. Drawing subscribers has become a priority for big tech companies as traditional growth sources such as ad sales become less reliable.The U.S. software company had said it wanted the deal to help it compete with gaming leaders Tencent (0700.HK) and PlayStation owner Sony (6758.T), which has criticized the deal.But, in its complaint, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which enforces antitrust law, said that Microsoft had a record of hoarding valuable gaming content.\"Microsoft has already shown that it can and will withhold content from its gaming rivals,\" said Holly Vedova, director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Competition. \"Today, we seek to stop Microsoft from gaining control over a leading independent game studio and using it to harm competition in multiple dynamic and fast-growing gaming markets.\"The agency set a hearing before an administrative law judge for August 2023.Microsoft President Brad Smith said the company would fight the FTC. \"While we believed in giving peace a chance, we have complete confidence in our case and welcome the opportunity to present our case in court,\" he said.The Biden administration has taken a more aggressive approach to antitrust enforcement. The U.S. Department of Justice recently stopped a $2.2 billion merger of Penguin Random House, the world's largest book publisher, and smaller U.S. rival Simon & Schuster.\"This is more evidence of the administration's and the antitrust agencies' war against big tech,\" said Andre Barlow of the law firm Doyle, Barlow and Mazard PLLC. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have prioritized big tech in antitrust enforcement.Shares in Activision closed down 1.5% at $74.76, while Microsoft slipped from earlier highs but closed about 1% higher at $247.40.[1/2]A person walks past a Microsoft store in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., January 20, 2022. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File Photo Acquire Licensing RightsActivision, which has long dreamt of being a Disney-like entertainment conglomerate, also realized it needed more tech know-how and it could be forced to trim back its roster of games to shift resources into emerging areas such as AI.COMPETITION CONCERNSThe FTC said that its concern was that Activision's popular games, including \"World of Warcraft\" and \"Diablo,\" would not continue to be offered on a range of consoles, PCs and mobile devices.While Microsoft has suggested concessions to address competition concerns, the rapid pace of change in the tech and gaming industries could make those conditions useless over time.To woo regulators, shortly after the deal was announced Microsoft unveiled a new set of principles for its app store, including open access to developers who meet privacy and security standards.This month, in another move to blunt criticism, Microsoft entered into a 10-year commitment to offer \"Call of Duty,\" the popular first-person shooter series, to Nintendo (7974.T) platforms. Microsoft made the same offer to Sony.Antitrust challenges have stumbled when companies put forward a \"fix\" for antitrust harms being done by a deal, said William Kovacic, a former FTC chair who now teaches law.\"I think we can predict with a high degree of certainty that he (the judge) will listen to those arguments (from Microsoft) and may be sympathetic to it,\" said Kovacic.Chair Lina Khan and the two Democrats on the commission voted to approve the complaint, while Commissioner Christine Wilson, a Republican, voted no.Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick told employees on Thursday that he was confident that the deal would go forward.\"The allegation that this deal is anti-competitive doesn't align with the facts, and we believe we\u2019ll win this challenge,\" he told employees, saying that he believed the companies' arguments would win \"despite a regulatory environment focused on ideology and misconceptions about the tech industry.\"The deal also faces regulatory headwinds in Europe.As of late November, Microsoft was expected to offer remedies to EU antitrust regulators in the coming weeks to stave off formal objections to the deal, people familiar with the matter said. The deadline for the European Commission to set out a formal list of competition concerns, known as a statement of objection, is in January.Reporting by Diane Bartz; Additional reporting by David Shepardson and Paresh Dave; Editing by Nick Zieminski, Alexandra Alper, Lisa Shumaker and Howard GollerOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "description": "Aerial photo taken on April 19, 2022 shows the Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang, northwest China's Gansu Province. (Xinhua/Du Zheyu)LANZHOU, Dec. 9 (Xinhua) -- China launched a cultural heritage digital platform supported by blockchain technology to share digital renderings of six millennium-old grottoes sites in northwest China's Gansu Province with people around the world Thursday.Jointly developed by the Dunhuang Academy and Chinese tech giant Tencent, the platform can authorize using over 6,500 pieces of high-definition materials in real-time, including digital scanning of murals and the Dunhuang manuscripts preserved in such grottoes as the world cultural heritage sites Mogao Grottoes and Bingling Temple Grottoes.Previously, people had to wait even one week before getting the authorization to use those digital resources, according to the academy.The platform also invites people to join in cultural and creative product designing with these cultural resources and share in the profits made by their creations.This undated photo provided by the Dunhuang Academy shows the prototype of Jiayao, the official virtual cartoon figure of Mogao Grottoes, with a human upper body, wings, and a bird-like lower body, playing the Chinese musical instrument pipa, on the caisson ceiling of cave No. 360 of Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang, northwest China's Gansu Province. (Dunhuang Academy/Handout via Xinhua)The Dunhuang Academy started the digitalization project in the 1990s to create digital versions of the Mogao Grottoes and other grotto temples and has accumulated massive digital cultural resources, said Su Bomin, director of the academy, adding that the first batch of these authoritative materials is open to the public to download for the first time.The transparent, immutable, and traceable blockchain technology, coupled with other technologies including facial recognition for identity authentication and artificial intelligence, can ensure the regulation of the digital market and intellectual property protection of digital products by providing a verifiable audit trail of transactions, said Li Hang, vice president of Tencent's marketing and public relations.This is a pioneering undertaking for rendering digital resources services in the cultural relic field, which could promote sustainable development of resource utilization, said Luo Jing, an official with the National Cultural Heritage Administration. \u25a0",

            "description": "Synced is an upcoming free to play third-person looter shooter developed by NeXT Studios, and is Tencent's crack at a live-service game akin to The Division. It has roguelite bits to help it stand out a touch, with the ability to command your own shiny gem pal to bash enemies. But from what I've played so far, its lack of clarity makes its grind for currencies and mod slots and whatever else a tired affair that probably won't pull you away from the bazillion other games that require a lifetime investment.I spent just over an hour with Synced's PVE mode Dead Sector, where I teamed up with another journo, and a member of the PR team who guided us both through the mode's inner workings. I bounced between a couple of Runners (classes), one who chucked a poison bomb and a silver fox of a medic who'd probably excel on Hinge. The game does have a PVP mode, but it wasn't available during the preview unfortunately.We started a Dead Sector run that plopped us onto a map reminiscent of PUBG's original environment: a non-descript plain of green grass, rolling hills, and generic sciencey checkpoints that consisted of grey buildings and steel staircases. Our goal was to move between Surges, a sequence of swirling tornadoes that spawned waves of crystalline baddies that we had to clear as fast as we could, as a timer ticked down and upped the difficulty from doable to impossible.While I'm a fan of clear-cut goals, my motivation to explore the map and seek out safe rooms filled with loot, or indeed anything else, was snuffed out by the need to plough on. If we hung about, we'd make things harder for ourselves, and \"harder\" meant getting so much as a nick from a golem's gem and immediately going down. The reward never seemed to outweigh the risk.To help us beat the clock \u2013 and the Surges \u2013 the game hit us with upgrade stations that were straight out of the roguelike equivalent of the Screwfix catalogue. So long as you had enough cash to hand, you could choose from three random upgrades that would alter your character's build in some way. For instance, \"eliminating a Nano by hitting its Weak Point drops explosives\" or \"Stunned Nanos with low health are killed with one hit\", each complete with rarities and levels. These stations would pop up periodically, so in a Hades or Dead Cells sort of way, you could opt to upgrade your upgrades as you went along.Enemies have vague Metal Gear: Survive energy.I wouldn't say I felt the impact of many of the upgrades, though, even if I knew they were doing something, if that makes sense? Like, the numbers that popped out of enemies may have been higher, but I wanted my fallen enemies to erupt with a cascade of fireworks or scatter blasts like they'd dropped packets of explosive marbles. Still, us Runners had our own Nanos up our sleeves \u2013 quite literally \u2013 so that maybe the ability to command our own baddie would provide some much-needed spark? Well... sort of.The game's big hook is commanding your own Nano companions, which can bash, beam, or block baddies for you. There are four to choose from, each fulfilling a specific class role like a big lad who smashes stuff, a scout who scans stuff, a tank who blocks things with his shield, and a sniper. If you're in the thick of battle, you can press a button to send them in and crack on, which makes scraps that little bit easier, although it was hard to get a sense of the others' usefulness, as the \"Seer\" (one who scouts and shoots laser beams) didn't seem to do an awful lot, while the \"Crusher\" was so obviously pummeling stuff around me. Maybe in much harder scenarios they'd outdo themselves, but - channeling my obnoxious Apprentice board room lingo for a second - I didn't they they added much value to the Surge clearing. Aside from making things easier, it would seem silly to go for any other Nano than the massive one who crushes stuff.So, we cleared around three Surges before a BIG SURGE spawned on the map, which ended up being a large pillar that shot area-of-effect spikes on the ground and sported these googly weak points we'd need to rattle our ammo into. Defeat this fella and we'd reap the rewards! Modification chips and currency with which to equip said chips! And then, we'd repeat the process all over again, which I think was meant to be a bit trickier but didn't really feel it? After that we reached the Tyrant, the mode's big boss.Hoovering up loot never gets old.And the Tyrant proved to be a short-lived affair. Mainly because we all died in one hit to a hulking great crystal man, and went to back to base with our spoils. It's at the base you can bang open your character's menu and stick those mods right up into your four PVE ports \u2013 so long as you've got the chips to do so. The customisation seems like a deep well, to be fair. You can enchant your weapons with fire or, like, slap different attachments on to alter their stats. You can upgrade your mods or recycle them. You can stick some mods up the ports of your Nano friend, too. Speak to the NPCs in the base and they'll offer you a checklist of missions to complete to earn more of various currencies. That's live-service with a (slightly dead) smile, baby.If you can't tell already, my thoughts on Synced could all be rounded up into a pen of indifference. Not to be too downbeat or reductive, but I can't see that it'll carve out its own space and fend off all the other mighty, mighty live service games out there. Especially when a lot of the game's defining features, like its roguelike upgrades and Nano companions, are about as clear as an aged shower screen. There's nothing that punches through it and offers anything new, even if \"new\" meant a shattered shower screen and a floor that's now flooded with soapy water. I'd take that, to be honest.For some, mod slots, augments, and upgrades will be bliss. For me - a tired Destiny 2 vet - I'm unsure whether I can be arsed.Not to say that Synced doesn't deliver a fun experience \u2013 far from it. I enjoyed myself! Despite being a beta, the game felt quite polished, with gunplay that made melted health bars in the same satisfying way that you'd get in something like The Division or Remnant From The Ashes. If you're a sucker for numbers popping out of enemies and hoovering up loot, the game certainly delivers.But from what I've played so far, I wouldn't say it does anything that'll either pull me away from the Destinys or Fortnites and wouldn't convince me to invest all my time into another looter shooter. Perhaps the PVP mode is where the game's true magic lies? Maybe? We shall see, I suppose.If you'd like to give the game a crack, the open beta starts on 10th December and continues all the way through to 15th January.",

            "description": "Consolidation in the ultra-fast delivery market continues, as Getir is set to acquire its rival Gorillas for $1.2 billion, the Financial Times reports. The companies, worth a reported $10 billion combined, did not disclose whether the deal was all-equity , all-cash , or a combination of both.Several of Gorillas\u2019 investors\u2014which includes Delivery Hero, Coatue Management, Tencent, and DST\u2014will be paid a combined $40 million in cash, in addition to receiving equity in Getir, the publication reports.AdvertisementGetir slashed its valuation from $11.8 billion to $8.8 billion in March. Given the drop in valuation, some Gorillas backers will be left with little or no return on their investment. Job cuts are expected due to the companies\u2019 overlap in their networks of \u201cdark stores,\u201d\u2014essentially fulfillment centers\u2014in cities such as London, Paris, Amsterdam, and Berlin.Ka\u011fan S\u00fcmer, the CEO who co-founded Gorillas in 2020, is expected to leave the company after the acquisition is finalized, the Financial Times reports.In a highly saturated, low-margin market where most ultra-fast delivery companies have yet to break even, analysts have long said consolidation offers a path to profitability.How 15-minute delivery ballooned into a $4 billion marketIn 2020 and 2021, as more people leaned on delivery during the pandemic, dozens of ultra-fast delivery companies launched in major cities with the idea of making delivery even more convenient\u2014by pledging to deliver food in about 15 minutes.AdvertisementThe ultra-fast delivery market raised nearly $4 billion from venture capitalists in 2021, up from half a billion the year before, according to data from market research firm PitchBook.Following the playbook of fast-growth startups like Uber playbook, these companies burned cash fast to move into new markets and to attract and retain customers with cheap services, with the hope of quickly building up market share.The quick-commerce companies doled out massive discounts to prop up delivery orders. For instance, Getir discounted more than 80% of its orders in countries like Germany and France in April, which highlighted the challenges of convincing consumers to pay the full price for a 15-minute delivery. But this model can work for some time when VC funding is plentiful and markets are stable.AdvertisementThe underlying business model, though, makes it hard to reach profitability. Margins are thin, as revenue is split between the food delivery company, the delivery person, and the restaurant or retailer. It\u2019s even harder for faster delivery, as it often requires hiring workers as employees with benefits since the work is riskier than typical food delivery. Infrastructure is costly, too, since fulfillment centers need be near customers\u2019 homes, often in expensive urban areas.What will consolidation mean for the ultra-fast delivery market?With Getir\u2019s acquisition of its rival Gorillas, the market has shrunk yet again. New York-based 15-minute delivery companies Buyk and Fridge No More shut down earlier this year. Meanwhile, ultra-fast delivery companies have been on a buying spree. Earlier this year, Gorillas agreed to acquire French delivery startup Fritchi. In 2021, GoPuff bought UK-based delivery startups Dija and Fancy, and Getir agreed to acquire British rival Weezy. Only a few large competitors remain, including US-based GoPuff and Germany-based Flink.As the remaining delivery companies absorb their rivals, that means increased market power, which can be leveraged to command higher fees from both businesses and customers.Even with the consolidation, there\u2019s still a question of whether people will want to pay a premium for this service, especially during a time of high inflation.",

[SONG YU/FOR CHINA DAILY]Chinese tech company Tencent Holdings is looking to transform from integrator to enabler and connector of other companies for its cloud business to stay competitive amid an accelerated digital transformation, according to its top executive.\"With the strategic transformation, Tencent aims to become a platform that can be integrated instead of acting as an integrator, which means becoming more focused on our own products and technologies, further enabling other companies,\" said Dowson Tong, senior vice-president of Tencent and CEO of Tencent's cloud and smart industries group, during the Tencent Digital Ecosystem Summit that ended on Thursday.Tong admitted that being an integrator requires a lot of experience, including stringing together different processes of an entire project, collecting different products, offering huge human support during the bidding process, making budgets with finance teams as well as communicating with customers.\"These are actually what Tencent was not good at before,\" Tong said.\"By enabling ecosystem partners to do the integration work instead, win-win cooperation, rather than competition, will be formed among Tencent and other companies,\" he said.Soon after the remarks, Tencent announced that it formed a new unit to serve rather than compete with local telecommunications carriers on Wednesday.The latest data from the company showed that WeCom, Tencent's enterprise communication platform, has connected over 10 million organizations with 500 million active WeChat users.Tencent's cloud conferencing tool has also supported more than 300 million users worldwide, while more than 3 million developers have also used Tencent's cloud platforms to create mini programs, deploy web applications and develop mobile applications.According to market consultancy Canalys, China's spending on cloud infrastructure services continued to grow 11 percent year-on-year in the second quarter of this year, reaching $7.3 billion and accounting for 12 percent of overall global cloud spending.Alibaba Cloud, Huawei Cloud, Tencent Cloud and Baidu AI Cloud maintained their positions as market leaders and together accounted for 79 percent of related expenditure in China, but \"all four saw a fall in their growth rates compared with past quarters\".\"China's cloud services have entered a new era where cloud vendors are no longer focused on just revenue scale and business growth, but more on high-margin, standardized products,\" said Canalys research analyst Zhang Yi.\"The top cloud vendors are trying to enrich their cloud capabilities by building their own channel ecosystems to bring together self-developed platform technologies and industry experience from partners.\"During the summit, Tong also pointed out that the company will continue to invest in the global market for cloud and software businesses by enriching its product offerings around cloud, video, AI, database and network security for international markets.",

Establishing these connections is important for global providers that want to gain a foothold in China\u2019s remittance market: Mobile payment users are expected to account for 65.1% of China\u2019s population this year.The bigger picture: As regulators tighten their grip on Tencent and rival Ant Group, these players are building stronger ties with global payment providers to bolster business.Tencent is tapping demand from global money transfer players that want to enter China\u2019s remittance market. Feeding on this demand helps Tencent better serve its local client base by giving them access to various global remittance services. And tie-ups with remittance providers can boost its cross-border payments business and increase revenues.Ant Group is taking a slightly different approach to its global business presence by building out Alipay+, the merchant solutions suite it launched last year. Alipay+ lets merchants accept several popular mobile wallets with a single integration\u2014opening a new revenue stream for Ant Group and helping diversify its business.",

            "description": "China\u2019s technology stocks have come under heavy selling pressure throughout 2021 and 2022 as the government has cracked down on monopolistic practices.Worries over regulation and further potential government action have also seen sentiment remain muted for China\u2019s technology sector.As there\u2019s talk of China\u2019s economy potentially reopening in 2023, and an easing up of the tough approach to tech companies, it\u2019s worth seeing how the companies in the sector are actually performing.Luckily, investors got to see how the two biggest Chinese technology stocks \u2013 Tencent Holdings Ltd (HKEX: 700) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (HKEX: 9988) (NYSE: BABA) \u2013 have done.Both companies reported their latest quarterly earnings earlier this month. Here\u2019s what investors should know about how these two Chinese tech giants fared.Tencent \u2013 Special Meituan DividendFor Tencent, which reported its 3Q2022 results on 16 November, the biggest news was that it would return capital back to shareholders in the form of a special dividend.Instead of cash, though, this special dividend would come in the shape of Meituan Dianping (HKEX: 3690) shares. That\u2019s because Tencent owns a US$22 billion stake in the online food delivery and travel firm.Tencent shareholders will receive 1 Meituan share for every 10 Tencent shares they hold. At Meituan\u2019s current share price (of HK$136), that equals an effective special dividend per share (DPS) of HK$13.60.The special dividend will be distributed to shareholders in March 2023 and will mean Tencent will have divested nearly all of its stake in Meituan.Tencent Business Still Faces ObstaclesOn the business front, the picture was less appealing. Revenue fell for the second consecutive quarter, falling 2% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2022 to RMB 140 billion (US$19.5 billion).Meanwhile, Tencent\u2019s net profit increased by 2% year-on-year to RMB 32.3 billion. Its operating profit of RMB 40.9 billion for Q3 2022 was broadly flat year-on-year while its operating margin of 29% was also stable.However, its gaming division still faces headwinds as domestic gaming sales dropped 7% year-on-year during the quarter. This was partially offset by its overseas gaming division, which saw sales increase 3% year-on-year.Tencent has seen only one game approved for domestic launch since the Chinese government resumed approving games in April.There was a bright spot in its FinTech and Business Services division, which saw revenue grow 4% year-on-year to RMB 44.8 billion.Overall, it was another challenging quarter for the WeChat and gaming giant. Divesting its stake in Meituan looked to be an attempt to unwind its multiple positions in China\u2019s key tech players while also returning capital to shareholders.While management hasn\u2019t outlined any timetable for divestments, Tencent owns sizeable stakes in other listed tech companies such as Kuaishou Technology (HKEX: 1024) and Pinduoduo Inc (NASDAQ: PDD).Tencent may take the decision over the next 12-18 months to divest more of its investment holdings to appease Chinese regulators further and return capital back to shareholders.Alibaba \u2013 Buyback Programme ExtendedFor e-commerce and cloud computing giant Alibaba, 3Q2022 earnings were worse than expected.The company did manage to outdo Tencent in that it reported an increase in quarterly revenue, which rose 3% year-on-year to RMB 207 billion. However, this still fell short of expectations.CEO Daniel Zhang commented that \u201cconsumption appetite was weak\u201d during the quarter given that China\u2019s resurgence of Covid has impacted many areas.He also commented that the famous 11.11 Singles\u2019 Day sales were flat from last year and that from October to early November, around 15% of delivery areas were impacted by abnormal or suspended services because of Covid disruption.Alibaba\u2019s core e-commerce business is also coming under threat from the likes of Douyin and Kuaishou, who have strongly increased their numbers of buyers during the current 11.11 sales period. Alibaba\u2019s cloud computing division also saw a deceleration as it posted just 4% year-on-year revenue growth to RMB 20.8 billion.The big positive news came from an extension of its US$25 billion share buyback programme that Alibaba announced back in March of this year.By mid-November, the company had deployed US$18 billion to repurchase shares. In addition to announcing its quarterly earnings, Alibaba management also said it would be upsizing the current repurchase programme by another US$15 billion.This would see Alibaba continue repurchasing shares until the end of the fiscal year 2025 (FY2025).Tencent and Alibaba Returning CapitalOverall, it was another challenging quarter for China\u2019s two most famous technology companies.The big theme of this most recent earnings result was the fact that both companies are happy to return capital to shareholders.Both businesses are still cash generative although each faces its own unique business challenges.While Tencent and Alibaba could benefit a lot if the Chinese economy starts to open slowly to the world over the next year, in the meantime it looks like their management teams are focusing on effectively managing costs, appeasing regulators and returning capital to shareholders.Advertiser MessageLooking to gain exposure to the Hong Kong Stocks here on SGX?You can do so via Daily Leverage Certificates (DLCs) that allows you to gain leveraged exposure of up 7x on key Hang Seng Indices and 5x on Hong Kong Stocks for both Long and Short direction.

Tencent Cloud and Smart Industries Group Senior Executive Vice President and CEO Dowson Tong shares his thoughts about the company\u2019s cloud-computing journey and what businesses need to do to stay competitive amid accelerated digitalization.By Dowson TongWith the convergence of the digital and physical worlds, businesses need to leverage technology to stay competitive in the global marketplace and meet the needs of today's much more demanding mobile-native generation. We established the Tencent Cloud and Smart Industries Group (CSIG) in 2018 to provide innovative solutions for industries that are ripe for business transformation using digital technologies.We\u2019re fortunate that many global enterprises have chosen Tencent as a long-term strategic partner. Their overriding goal is to embrace the always-connected lifestyle and capture the next opportunities created by advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and automation with the explosive growth of all kinds of data.Tencent has the broadest portfolio of online services among Chinese Internet companies. We have the largest computing infrastructure in China with over a million servers, half of which we use for our own services such as Weixin and QQ, while the other half is used by our partners and enterprise customers.Cloud Services Grow at TencentWe started offering cloud services for partners on the QQ open platform in 2010. Three years later, we officially launched Tencent Cloud to the public. Tencent Cloud has since then helped many Chinese Internet companies such as Little Red Book and Bilibili manage their exponential growth by meeting their computing needs.In 2016, we established global partner networks in Asia, Europe and America to bring Chinese enterprises to the world and help global companies enter the Chinese market. Two years later, with the formation of CSIG, we rolled out a strategic upgrade to embrace the newest evolution in digitization \u2013 the industrial internet.Last year was a meaningful year for us in this journey. We opened six new data centers in Bangkok, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Tokyo, and Sao Paulo, accelerating our global business expansion. We now have data centers in 26 geographic areas on five continents with 70 availability zones and an exabyte-level storage capacity. In addition, our content delivery network has deployed 2,800 acceleration nodes, covering 70+ countries and regions.Tencent Cloud Improves Streaming ExperienceWe have put in a lot of effort into optimizing the live video streaming experience in high quality and low latency, and ensuring reasonable response even under slow and unstable network conditions, domestically and overseas. This has created an enormous benefit for our customers.For example, GE Healthcare provided intelligent equipment, data analysis, software applications and services for disease diagnosis, treatment and monitoring. With our help, the company sells a remote consultation solution built upon the Tencent Real-Time Communication (TRTC) platform.With the TRTC, ultrasound operators perform on-site examinations in the clinic and medical specialists can remotely diagnose patients in real time based on the ultrasound imagery. Our technology delivers a much smoother playback experience with latency of below 300 milliseconds and a packet loss prevention rate of over 50%. The system is well received by medical teams in North and South America and other regions.Network Security is a PriorityTencent Security is recognized for its expertise in vulnerability and intrusion detection as well as network and data protection. We have won a series of international security competitions over the years.We operate a large global network of nodes that enable us to quickly detect and protect our customers from the latest security threats. We aim to deliver secure, reliable and smart cloud technologies so businesses can thrive and stay protected in the digital age.This summer, we launched Tencent Cloud EdgeOne for the international market by integrating our security offerings for easier management. Tencent Cloud EdgeOne has enhanced attack protection, a web application firewall, network flow control features and various other upgraded capabilities to help our customers protect their services from network attacks and avoid business interruptions.Tencent Helps Overseas Customers CompeteWe have many years of experience guiding our overseas business partners in their journey into the Chinese market by leveraging our comprehensive online ecosystem and the cloud technology that powers it.For example, French pharmaceutical company Sanofi leverages Weixin Mini Programs to improve the user experience of patient interactions. They also use our enterprise messenger WeCom, Tencent Meeting and VooV Meeting to communicate with clinical practitioners.As the world's largest automobile market, China is also the fastest-growing market for connected electric vehicles. Many global automotive manufacturers such as BMW and NIO are working closely with Tencent Cloud to develop intelligent cockpits with our voice AI technology and online services.Many manufacturers also use Tencent's high-definition map technology to build next-generation smart navigation systems and our cloud data-management solution for regulatory compliance in the China market.We are committed to helping our customers succeed. Going forward, we will continue to invest in the global market for our cloud and software businesses and expand our overseas infrastructure coverage, developing local integration and service partnership networks.Our overriding goal is to use our unique strengths in cloud, video, AI, database, and network security for the international markets \u2013 all with the goal of building a competitive product portfolio and a sustainable technology business with a long-term commitment to our global customers and partners.",

            "description": "Tencent recently commissioned tech research and consulting firm Gartner to produce a white paper titled \u201cCoping with New Challenges and Preventing New Risks, Digitalization Helps Car Companies Turn Crisis into Opportunity\u201d. The paper outlines critical changes in the auto industry, the pathway to digital transformation, and why and how technology companies and cloud services are part of the solution for car makers.The Auto Industry Is Undergoing a Digital TransformationMassive changes are taking place in the global auto industry. Shifting consumer expectations, increasing regulatory scrutiny, the quest for autonomous driving, and other technological innovations are pushing automakers to rethink their business model and their relationship with customers.The whole value chain, from research and development to manufacturing, must be re-evaluated through the lens of digitalization to win over new and existing customers and drive growth. Technology companies are now an essential part of the automaking ecosystem along with car and parts manufacturers.Key to the digital transformation are cloud-based technologies that handle the sector\u2019s unprecedented data needs. To succeed, AI, cloud, big data, consumer connectivity and other capabilities must be integrated, bridging every unit across the automotive industry chain digitally. Only then can brands respond to the evolving market.Three Trends Upending the Market1. Cars become greener and more intelligentIn the drive for smart, sustainable vehicles, autonomous driving has become a new industry trend. Electric and other new energy vehicles are growing at scale too in a bid to phase-out fossil fuel-powered cars. Software and computing power are now as important as the hardware and will become the core competitiveness of automobiles. As more countries commit to cut carbon emissions, auto makers are expected to take a leading role in driving sustainability through the products they create.2. Consumers are in the driver\u2019s seat of changeThe digitally-native Generation Z consumer is an influential segment among first-time car buyers in which they rely on online channels and word-of-mouth to make decisions. Car companies must align their marketing strategies to digital touchpoints to directly engage users while creating a flexible digital supply chain.3. The value of cars extends to after-sales experiencesAccording to a white paper by consulting firm Deloitte, the automotive aftermarket will account for 55 percent of the full value chain by 2025. This highlights the importance for car companies to invest in offering high quality, personalized after-sales service to improve user experience throughout the vehicle\u2019s whole life cycle in order to build and maintain customer loyalty.The People-Centric Path to Digital TransformationHuman-centered digitalization means that everything from product design and manufacturing to digital marketing should revolve around users. It\u2019s a new business model that defines the future of the auto industry.Our white paper showed that a successful, people-centred digital transformation will occur when the entire product and service supply chain is designed by taking the end-user\u2019s perspective into account. To do this, companies should build a digital network that links R&D, design, production, manufacturing, sales, and after-sales, and provide users with global access and closed-loop, full-cycle digital services.To facilitate digital transformation in the auto industry, a new generation of digital infrastructure is critical. This includes an efficient and stable cloud computing service, a robust data infrastructure, and stringent security measures to boost cyber resilience. Such changes will not happen overnight but companies should take steps to spearhead digital transformation with stakeholders that are critical to facilitate this process, including with parts and components suppliers, auto dealers, service providers and users.Minimizing Risk Through Product and Enterprise DigitalizationAuto companies can boost their resilience to supply chain disruptions through product digitalization. Enterprise digitalization, underpinned by data-based, modular systems can also optimize the whole supply chain to increase efficiency and promote sustainable growth.Cloud service providers have become strategic partners to auto companies as they look to integrate their operations with cloud management across the value chain. To facilitate the transition, cloud services must meet enterprise\u2019s needs for:1. Urgent cloud native and agility requirements;2. Strict data compliance and security requirements;3. Deeper integration of technology and business;4. Flexible and open continuous evolution capabilities; and5. Autonomous and controllable data asset management.The digital transformation of car companies will only occur when an intelligent cloud network is in place. This enables the real time delivery of computing power and services efficiently and securely.R&D and Design Speeds upTechnological changes and fierce market competition have shortened the R&D cycle for new cars to as little as two years. With digital twins becoming the standard to evaluate the full life cycle of a vehicle, manufacturers need to process and evaluate a massive amount of data.Our white paper found that each autonomous driving test vehicle generates more than 1TB of data per day and that requires specialized storage solutions. In addition, auto companies need sophisticated digital infrastructure to perform large-scale simulations.Powerful, flexible, low-cost and environmentally friendly solutions can be found with HPC (High-Performance Computing) tools that can be adapted to different types of CAE (computer-aided engineering) simulation software that are now considered essential by car makers. These solutions cut the amount investment needed in R&D and improve efficiency.The Race to Autonomous DrivingThe road to commercialized self-driving cars will be met with several hurdles, such as strict data regulations as well as the need to have superior computing and data storage facilities to support the launch. To get there, cutting-edge technologies such as AI, the Internet of Things and HPC must be integrated to standardized operations.Tech companies play a critical role in supporting car companies on their road to autonomous driving through the use of autonomous, scalable hybrid cloud platforms with pluggable network components and modular design.Tencent\u2019s autonomous driving cloud platform provides a one-stop solution to support auto makers in their research and development on self-driving. The platform provides key capabilities in:1. Efficient data management and retrieval;2. Auto labelling of data sets using AI;3. Automated scenario construction;4. High-performance storage; and5. Efficient operation of all R&D aspects of autonomous driving.Sales and Marketing Becomes a Two-Way RelationshipMarketing by car makers used to be one-way. However, the rise of digitally savvy consumers has led to a shift to the use of interactive digital marketing solutions that combine paid public traffic, including e-commerce sites and social media accounts pre-sale, with private traffic sources such as WeChat, mini programs, and a company\u2019s own official website to maintain relationships with customers throughout the product cycle.By leveraging interactive channels, car makers can establish ongoing connections with customers, creating value for them through targeted marketing and introducing value-added services.Empowering the Auto Industry to Future-Proof ThemselvesThe white paper concludes that smart manufacturing partnerships empower the car industry to automate, customize, go green, and flexibly upgrade production lines based on data and AI capabilities.With the rise of cloud computing that has grown in scale and revolutionized the industry, it is critical for automakers to consider updating their strategy, integrating this new type of infrastructure with their operations in order to keep up with the everchanging industry landscape.",

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration Acquire Licensing RightsSEOUL, Nov 22 (Reuters) - A Chinese streaming platform has resumed distributing South Korean content after suspending it for nearly six years, South Korean officials said on Tuesday, in what Seoul called a sign of Beijing's readiness to improve ties.China's streaming site Tencent began distributing a film by South Korean director Hong Sang-soo, \"Hotel by the River,\" earlier this month, they said, in the first such move after Beijing effectively banned K-pop imports amid tension over the THAAD U.S. missile defence system stationed in South Korea.A South Korean presidential official linked the timing of the gesture to a recent summit between South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol and Chinese President Xi Jinping.Yoon and Xi held their first face-to-face talks in Bali last week during which both sides agreed to boost cooperation. It marked the first meeting between leaders of the two countries since 2019.Kim Eun-hye, Yoon's press secretary, said the South Korean president has stressed the need to promote cultural and people-to-people exchanges at the meeting, and the change at TenCent appeared to be a \"response\" from Beijing.Relations between South Korea and China have been frayed in recent years following the installation in South Korea of the THAAD system in 2017 to better counter North Korea's evolving missile threats.China had argued that THAAD's powerful radar could peer into its airspace, and reactd by sharply cutting trade and cultural imports with South Korea, in a major blow to bilateral ties.Reporting by Soo-hyang Choi; Editing by Simon Cameron-MooreOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "description": "A game services license for the Chinese market between major US developer Blizzard Entertainment and local firm NetEase has lasted for 14 years, promoting top international games in mainland China. However, on November 17, Activision Blizzard suddenly announced that its existing agreement with NetEase will expire on January 23, 2023.SEE ALSO: Blizzard Requires NetEase to Pay Two-Year Cooperation Income in Advance, Sources SayThe focus of industry attention, in addition to the reasons behind the breakdown of this cooperation, now lies in who will take over the agency rights of Blizzard Entertainment\u2019s games in China. A Tencent insider has disclosed that multiple Chinese game developers who are negotiating agency rights with Blizzard Entertainment include Tencent , ByteDance\u2019s Nuverse, Perfect World, Bilibili and others, according to a report by a media outlet under Caijing. There are other reports that The9, a Shanghai-based online game operator that was former agent of Blizzard Entertainment games in China, is also in talks with Microsoft, which is going to acquire Blizzard next year.In this report, the insider disclosed that at the beginning of this year, there was news that NetEase and Blizzard had come into conflict and might terminate their licensing contract. Meanwhile, Chinese internet giant Tencent has reportedly been in contact with Blizzard for at least a year. However, the source believes that the possibility of Tencent taking over this cooperation is unlikely. \u201cI feel that Tencent will be an also-ran. The game industry as a whole is in a downturn this year. It is unlikely that Tencent will spend a large amount of money to sign the contract.\u201dGame approval numbers issued by the Chinese government are one of the factors that cause developers to hesitate. The approvals of Blizzard Entertainment games in China belong to a subsidiary under NetEase , which is 100% owned by CEO William Ding. In China, for online games that have been pre-approved or imported by the China General Administration of Press and Publication, if the operating unit is changed, the approval procedures shall be re-submitted. From the date of change of the operating unit to regaining approval, all services for involved games will be stopped. Violators will be treated under the transgression of illegal online publishing.It is unlikely that NetEase will transfer its approval numbers to other game developers. In this case, Blizzard Entertainment will need to stop game services in China for a period of time. The time to obtain the approval number is full of uncertainty, ranging from a few months to a year. However, it was reported that Blizzard requires the future cooperation operator to pay two-year income in advance, which means that the new game agent needs to face the situation that there is no relevant revenue while waiting for the approval number while still having to pay a large amount of money. For this reason, ByteDance, which appears to have abundant funds and an urgent need to expand its influence in the game field, has become a possible successor, as speculated by some experts in the industry.According to the previously mentioned insider, there is a high possibility that NetEase will continue to serve as the agent. This is because in March next year, after Microsoft completes its acquisition of Blizzard (this move is being investigated by the European Union, and it will be decided whether to approve it before March next year), it will appoint a new CEO. This position is currently filled by Bobby Kotick, who is believed to be the primary actor behind the recent collapse in collaboration. If this occurs, the cooperation agreement can remain the same and avoid the approval issue.Regarding the reasons for the breakdown of cooperation, Chinese media reported that Blizzard Entertainment put forward four conditions. First, the share ratio of Blizzard was further increased compared with more than 50% of revenue and net profit during the contract period from 2019 to 2022. Second, NetEase will develop other IP mobile games of Blizzard for global distribution, but only enjoys the revenue share of the Chinese market, and NetEase must pay a deposit. Third, regarding the game approval problem in China, Blizzard put forward binding clauses that cannot be guaranteed. Fourth, when signing the renewal contract, NetEase has to pay two-years cooperation money in advance, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars.NetEase has not issued a response regarding the matter and Blizzard Entertainment has not issued any follow-up. An insider close to NetEase disclosed in the report that these four conditions are true.On the evening of November 20, a NetEase -operated Chinese social media account called \u201cBlizzard Entertainment Game Channel\u201d released a video on Blizzard Entertainment\u2019s games in China, recording the history of the two firm\u2019s cooperation since 2008.Many employees of Blizzard China then forwarded the video on their own social media accounts. One wrote, \u201cStand on the last shift and help you dress up before you go\u2026 I believe that we will definitely meet again!\u201d An official comment area offers other perspectives, with one user writing, \u201cThank you for the company, after this I wish Blizzard Entertainment an early bankruptcy.\u201d",

Good evening. Thanks, everyone, for joining us. During the third quarter, we streamline our costs and activate new revenue-generating services, returning to year-on-year earnings growth.We also delivered a quarter-on-quarter earnings growth with a strong tailwind from positive seasonality. Total revenue was RMB 140 billion, down 2% year on year but up 5% quarter on quarter. Gross profit was RMB 62 billion, down 1% year on year but up 7% quarter on quarter. Non-IFRS operating profit was RMB 41 billion, flat year on year and up 12% quarter on quarter.Non-IFRS net profit attributable to equity holders was RMB 32 billion, up 2% year on year and 15% quarter on quarter. For our key services, we [Inaudible] first-place positions in activities, including social, games, long-form video, news, music, literature, payment, and mobile browser. Combined MAU of Weixin and WeChat was 1.3 billion. Mobile devices MAU of QQ was 574 million.I will now hand it over to Martin for strategy review.Martin Lau -- PresidentThank you, Pony, and good evening and good morning to everybody. In last quarter's strategy review, I discussed how we have positioned ourselves to improve efficiencies, develop new revenue streams, and soon revive our profit growth. Today, I will update you on our progress and some early stage results. In addition, I would touch on our latest steps in returning capital to shareholders.Let's start off with the progress of our efficiency initiatives. First, we further tightened our control of marketing costs, pulled back from projects with low-cost efficiency and focused on resources and core products. As a result, selling and marketing expenses decreased by 32% year on year and by 10% quarter on quarter. Second, we achieved a significant margin improvement in business services.Gross profits grew both year on year and quarter on quarter, benefiting from our proactive adjustments to generate high-quality revenue. Third, we optimized bandwidth and server utilization associated video accounts, bringing down our operating costs per video view significantly. Fourth with our rationalization in noncore and underperforming businesses, we optimized our workforce and controlled staff cost. At the end of the third quarter, our total headcount was down as compared to the end of the first quarter.Excluding severance pay, total staff costs increased at a low single-digit growth rate year on year. While the macro environment is still challenging, our efficiency initiatives enabled us to achieve slightly positive year-on-year growth in profits, representing a significant improvement over the last few quarters. Looking forward, we are making encouraging progress in developing new high-quality revenue streams in the following three key growth areas. Video accounts' in-feed ads revenue has been ramping up fast since we made additional inventory available in bases in mid-August.We are on track to exceed RMB 1 billion in quarterly revenue in the fourth quarter. For international games, we launched new hits, Tower of Fantasy and Goddess of Victory: Nikke, demonstrating our strong publishing capabilities. Our new strategic partnership with Ubisoft went on to enable us to bring more AAA franchises to mobile globally and PC titles to China. Together with the growing pipeline of a group of studios across genres and platforms globally, our international games business is well positioned for significant expansion over time.With SaaS, we're currently prioritizing scale expansion as there are precedents in the rest of the world, which demonstrate how these services can be monetized by industry leaders. We have recently launched a subscription bundle combining WeCom, Tencent Meeting, and Tencent Docs together, which is seeing good adoption among larger enterprises. In addition, we are encouraged to see positive signals across the path of macro and regulatory normalization. For fintech services, commercial payment volume growth recovered in the third quarter.On the regulatory front, we received approval for investment in Samsung property and casualty insurance in China, For domestic games, we received approval for a new game publishing license and an amendment to an existing license in September. We believe more licenses will be forthcoming in the future. For advertising, revenue grew quarter on quarter even excluding new contribution from video accounts in-feed ads. We are on track to resume year-on-year growth in late 2022.Next, I would like to update you on our capital allocation which we start from a position of both cash flow and asset strength. We operate a diversified portfolio of businesses spanning across social networks, games, advertising, and fintech services, each of which generates robust cash flow even under the current environment. Consequently, we generated operating cash flow of USD 25 billion over the past 12 months. After taking into account payments for capital expenditure, media content, and lease liabilities, our free cash flow amounted to USD 15 billion.On the asset side, as of the end of September 2022, we have total gross cash of USD 44 billion, stakes in listed companies with a fair value of USD 75 billion, and stakes in unlisted companies with a carrying value of USD 48 billion. This combination of cash flow generation and liquid asset holdings enable us to simultaneously invest in our business while returning capital to shareholders. Believe we have fully supporting organic and strategic investments which benefit our business. For organic investments, we are deploying capital into growth areas we have highlighted, namely video accounts, international games, and SaaS products, as well as ecosystem enhancements such as nurturing a vibrant e-commerce ecosystem for Weixin and upgrading our back-end infrastructure.For strategic investments, we continue to invest in companies that are complementary to our core business growth, such as our recent investments in partnership with Ubisoft and FromSoftware, to name a couple. At the same time, we are also returning more capital to shareholders. For the past 10 years, we paid out cash dividends, which represented the payout ratio of approximately 10% of our non-IFRS earnings. Since the beginning of the year, we have bought back USD 3 billion worth of shares.In March 2022, we paid a dividend in kind through distribution of JD.com shares, which amounted to USD 13 billion of value to shareholders. So, to date, we have returned a total of over USF 18 billion to our shareholders. Today, we are declaring a special interim dividend of Meituan shares worth approximately USD 20 billion, which will be distributed to shareholders in March 2023. Qualifying shareholders will receive one Meituan share for every Tencent shares they hold.This distribution in kind is equivalent to about HKD 16.6 per Tencent share based on yesterday's closing price. So, with that, I'll pass it to James to talk about our business review.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerThank you, Martin. For the third quarter of 2022, our total revenue was down 2% year on year. VAS represents 52% of our total revenue within which the social network subsegment was 21%; domestic games, 22%; and international games, 9%. Online advertising was 15%.And fintech and business services was 32% of total revenue. The value-added services segment revenue was 72.7 billion renminbi, down 3% year on year. Social network revenue was down 2% year on year to 29.8 billion renminbi. Revenue from music and game-related livestreaming services decreased, while revenue from video accounts livestreaming service increased, reflecting more users, additional content, and enhanced recommendation efficiency to better match users to content.Tencent video subscription revenue decreased slightly year on year as content scheduling today has resulted in subscriptions dipping. However, we increased our previously adjusted membership pricing. Our self-commissioned drama series, Love Like the Galaxy, which we released in July, ranks No. 1 by video views across all online platforms in China for the quarter. Our music subscription revenue increased year on year driven by more paying users.Our domestic game revenue was down 7% year on year to 31.2 billion renminbi as transitional challenges resulted in lower-paying user accounts. Honor of Kings and Peacekeeper Elite contributed decreased revenue due to the minor protection measures which took effect from September 2021 onwards. New games, Wild Rift, Returned to Empire, and League of Legends Esports Manager, contributed incremental revenues. Our international games revenue increased 3% year on year, or 1% in constant currency terms, to 11.7 billion renminbi.A robust performance from Valorant, the successful launch of Tower of Fantasy, and Miniclip's acquisition of Subway Surfers, and release of new games drove the growth. Turning to social networks, we leverage the extensive reach of Weixian and the ease of use of mini programs to better assist the real economy. Mini programs surpass 600 million daily active users, representing a year-on-year increase of more than 30%. Daily mini program activations were even faster by over 50% year on year.Additional commerce and municipal service use cases contributed to growing the number of users and the daily activations per user. We deepen the adoption of many programs among food and beverage, apparel and footwear brands, and shopping malls and department stores. These offline merchants and brands are increasingly integrating membership programs and loyalty points into their mini programs as they build out multichannel retail. The Health Code mini programs help users verify their health and travel status with over 320 billion visits year to date, facilitating continuity of business activity.On QQ, we provided more scenarios in Super QQ Show for social interaction. We collaborated with brands such as Gucci and KFC to launch virtual spaces where users could conduct immersive interactions. For example, users can participate in online to offline campaigns, collect branded virtual items, and socialize with other fans. Moving to domestic aims.With the implementation of our industry-leading minor protection program, we have become fully compliant with China government regulation, fostering a healthier industry environment. Time spent from users aged under 18 years old has decreased by 92% year on year and constituted 0.7% of total time spent in July 2022. On the other hand, our adult user base and user engagement increased year on year. For the month of September, our combined PC and mobile game adult DAU rose by a double-digit percentage year on year, and our total adult player time spent grew by a single-digit percentage year on year.Time spent growth was driven by existing titles such as Honor of Kings, Peacekeeper Elite, and CrossFire mobile and PC, as well as new titles such as Wild Rift and Arena Breakout. We're extending the longevity of our IP franchises. Taking one example, CrossFire, which is a game we first published on PC 14 years ago, as a result of innovation in areas such as player versus environment mode and ranked mode, CrossFire PC remains the leading game in the FPS genre on PC in China and grew its grossing receipts by a high single-digit percentage year on year in the first nine months of this year. In 2015, we published CrossFire mobile developed by TiMi Studio Group, significantly increasing the overall number of people playing CrossFire games in China.Benefiting from localized content insights, CrossFire mobile remains one of the top 10 mobile games by time spent and grossing receipts in China today. And we continue enriching the CrossFire franchise, professional esports events, and cross-media collaboration, such as a live-action drama series on Tencent video. International games are extending the success of our key internally developed franchises. Benefiting from Riot's esports experience, the Valorant Champions Tournament became the most popular esports event industrywide for tactical shooter games, expanding Valorant's fan base and driving record-high grossing receipts for the game itself in the third quarter.In October, Supercell released the biggest-ever content update, Town Hall 15, for Clash of Clans, which boosted user engagement and in-game consumption. Clash of Clans represents a lasting franchise, generally ranking as the top strategy game by annual grossing receipts worldwide since its launch, including year to date this year. We've also achieved breakthroughs in publishing investee studio and licensed games with the release of two major new titles, leveraging our content, marketing, and use of community management capabilities. Tower of Fantasy, an open-world MMORPG developed by Perfect World, which we released in August, became the second most popular MMORPG by daily active users internationally in the quarter.It achieved notable commercial success in the most competitive markets, ranking first by grossing receipts in Japan and second in the United States. Nikke, a sci-fi RPG shooter with anime graphics developed by our investee studio. Shift Up, was the highest grossing mobile game internationally in the first 10 days following its November launch. Nikke's success demonstrates how we can empower small investee studios to commercial success with our operational know-how and infrastructure scale.For online advertising, revenue was 21.5 billion renminbi in the third quarter. The rate of year-on-year decline has narrowed from 18% in the second quarter to 5% in the third quarter, benefiting from initial monetization in video accounts in-feed ads, improvements in the game's e-commerce and FMCG categories, and lapping of certain industry-specific headwinds from 2021. Sequentially, our advertising revenue grew 15%, benefiting from positive seasonality, the initial monetization of the video accounts in-feed ads, and our ongoing efforts to improve ad targeting technology. In video accounts, we saw a particularly robust demand from the FMCG and high-end brands.Advertising in video accounts is complementary and incremental to our existing advertising revenue. Excluding video accounts, ad revenue elsewhere in Weixin improved year on year, particularly from mini programs. Within the media subcategory, our long-form video ad revenue decreased year on year, primarily due to fewer releases of drama series and tough comparisons versus airing the Tokyo Olympic Games in the year-ago period. Looking at fintech and business services, segment revenue was 45 billion renminbi, up 4% year on year and 6% quarter on quarter.For fintech services, year-on-year revenue growth was higher compared to the previous quarter, mainly benefiting from a recovery in commercial payment activities, both offline and online. Our commercial payment volume achieved double-digit year-on-year growth, with notable expansion in categories such as groceries, dining services, and transportation. In business services, our revenue declined slightly year on year. However, gross profit increased significantly both year on year and quarter on quarter.Gross profit growth benefited from us exiting or scaling back certain loss-making activities such as deeply discounted contracts for content delivery network and also from us shifting the revenue mix toward internally developed products and away from projects for the high proportion of subcontracting activity. We're striving to help non-internet industries embrace digital transformation, which is boosting our revenue from offline sectors such as financial services, industrials, and automotive. Highlighting a few examples of our industry solutions, Tencent Cloud Enterprise enables those customers, such as banks and municipalities who prefer to store data on their private clouds, to integrate and deploy our public cloud products within their private clouds. Tencent Cloud AI, digital humans, provides AI chat bots to customers in sectors such as financial services and tourism, enabling automated customer support.Tencent real-time communication is increasingly deployed in industrial use cases, such as enabling remote control for mining and container trucks so that our customers can scale their operating costs and provide their drivers with a safer working environment. And public sector organizations such as hospitals and schools are increasingly using our key software-as-a service tools, facilitating their efficient collaboration and online education provision. And now, I'll pass to John.John Lo -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you, James. Hello, everybody. For the third quarter of 2022, total revenue was 140.1 billion renminbi, down 2% year on year or up 5% quarter on quarter. Gross profit was 62 billion renminbi, down 1% year on year or 7% quarter on quarter.Net other gains was 20.9 billion renminbi, down 9% year on year or up 373% quarter on quarter, which were mainly non-IFRS adjustment items such as net gains on deemed disposal and disposal of certain investments, including a 41.3 billion renminbi gain from deemed disposal of Sea, net fair value losses from revaluation of certain investments, and the impairment provisions against certain investment in online and [Inaudible] and fintech verticals. Operating profit was 51.6 billion renminbi, down 3% year on year, up 72% Q on Q. Net finance costs were 2 billion renminbi, largely flat year on year, or up 8% quarter on quarter. The Q on Q change was mainly due to increased interest expense, partly offset by increased foreign exchange gains.Share of losses of associates and JVs was 3.7 billion renminbi compared to 5.7 billion renminbi last year. On a non-IFRS basis, profits was 2.4 billion renminbi compared to share of losses of 0.3 billion renminbi last year, reflecting improved profitability in certain domestic associates due to the cost-control measures. Interest tax -- income tax expense increased by 30% year on year to 7.1 billion renminbi mainly due to the provision of food and tax during the quarter. The effective tax rate was 15.5%.IFRS net profit attributed to equity holders was 39.9 billion renminbi, up 1% year on year and 115% quarter on quarter. Diluted EPS was 4.104 renminbi, up 0.7 year on year -- 0.7% year on year or 114% quarter on quarter. On non-IFRS basis, operating profit was 40.9 billion renminbi, largely stable year on year or up 12% quarter on quarter. Net profit attributable to equity holders was 32.3 billion renminbi, up 2% year on year or 15% quarter on quarter.Diluted EPS was 3.306 renminbi, up 1% year on year or 14% Q on Q. Moving on to gross margins. The overall gross margin was 44%, stable year on year or up one percentage point quarter on quarter. Gross margin for VAS was 51.7%, down 1.3 percentage points year on year or up 1.1 percentage point quarter on quarter.The y-o-y margin decrease is mainly due to a revenue mix shift on higher-margin game services to lower-margin video account livestreaming service. The q-on-q margin improvement reflect our cost optimization efforts within the segment. Gross margin for -- on advertising was 46.3%, broadly stable year on year or up 5.7 percentage points quarter on quarter. The q-on-q margin improvement benefited from the initial monetization of video account in-feed ads, as well as efficiency measures that we implemented within the segment.Gross margin for fintech and business was 33.3%, up 4.8 percentage points year on year or stable quarter on quarter. The year-on-year margin improvement was proven by our proactive efforts to reduce loss-making cloud services activities, leading to a healthier revenue mix and reduced cost base. On operating expenses, selling and marketing expenses decreased to 7.1 billion renminbi or 5.1% of revenues due to cost-efficiency initiatives Martin mentioned earlier. R&D expenses were 15.1 billion renminbi, up 10% y-on-y, broadly stable q-on-q.The year-on-year increase was driven by higher staff costs. R&D expenses were 10.8% of revenues. G&A expenses, excluding R&D, were 11.4 billion renminbi, up 12% year on year or 2% q-on-q. The year-on-year increase was due to higher operating lease and office expenses, as well as staff costs.At quarter end, we had approximately 109,000 employees, up 1% year on year or down 2% quarter on quarter. Let's take a look at our operating and net margin ratios. Non-IFRS operating margin was 29.2%, up 0.5 percentage point year on year or 1.8 percentage points quarter on quarter. Non-IFRS net margin was 23.8%, up one percentage point year on year or 2.2 percentage points quarter on quarter.Finally, I would summarize some key cash flow and balance sheet metrics. Total capex was 2.4 billion renminbi, down 66% year on year or 21% quarter on quarter. Within total capex, operating capex was 1.1 billion renminbi, down 81% year on year or 49% quarter on quarter. As we proactively reassess and tighten our spending plan for the year, nonoperating capex decreased by 9% year on year to 1.3 billion renminbi.Operating cash flow for the quarter was 41 billion renminbi, stable year on year or up 15% quarter on quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter was 27.6 billion renminbi, up 15% year on year or 23% Q on Q, reflecting our disciplined capex spending. Net debt position was 27.3 billion renminbi, compared to 20.4 billion renminbi last quarter. The sequential change was due to the effect of foreign currency translation differences on U.S.dollar-denominated assets, partly offset by stronger free cash flow generation. Thank you.Wendy Huang -- Macquarie ResearchThank you, John. Now, we open the floor for the questions. [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from William Packer from Exane BNP.William Packer -- Investor Relations OfficerHi, management. Many thanks for taking my question. Firstly, cost progress in recent quarters has been an important support for a return to profit growth, even though G&A costs continue to grow. Am I correct to think that this growth includes one-off restructuring costs associated with headcount reduction and other savings? Could you quantify those one off-costs to help us think about underlying cost growth? And then, secondly, my follow-up, in terms of domestic gaming, top-line momentum has weakened again.How should we think about a return to top-line growth for that segment? Do you need new IP for -- from future game approvals? Or can the easing of the minor gaming revenue headwind comps and potentially improving macro be sufficient? Thank you.John Lo -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, you're right that we have included all the one-off restructuring costs in G&A, ex R&D, on the staff costs. Total IFRS G&A, ex R&D, ex severance payment, well, on year-on-year basis, we have increased by very low single digits. So, we can't quantify it just using this basis.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerSo, Will, on the domestic game question, you know, you called out the right three factors which, you know, have been entering the industry growth and our growth, namely minor protection measures, the lack of new game licenses, which is very important in a supply driven industry, and also the challenging macroeconomic environment. Now, in terms of what it would take for us to successfully reboot domestic game revenue growth, then, you know, the industry and we are lapping the minor protection measures as of September. From a grossing receipts perspective, of course, that's a few months in which the grossing receipts from the prior quarters get amortized into our P&L. But -- but that effectively is behind us on a cash flow basis.We believe that in order for the revenue growth to sort of notably and sustainably reaccelerate, we would likely benefit from one of the other two changes coming through. And in terms of the other two factors, then we expect more new game licenses, more commercial games to come through relatively quickly. On the other hand, we don't have any great insight into when the macroeconomic improvement will turn up. Of course, if both of those factors turn positive, then we would see a faster rate of game revenue growth.But one of those factors turning positive alongside the lapping in minor protection measures, we think, would be sufficient to answer your question positively.Wendy Huang -- Macquarie ResearchThank you, Will. Next question comes from Eddie Leung from the Bank of America. Eddie, your line is open.Eddie Leung -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystGood evening. Two questions on your pieces. Maybe the first to follow up on the question about games. So with a few licenses [Inaudible] are we going to change our development strategy for the upgrade of the existing games in order to maximize [Inaudible] like the lifetime style, the lifetime value? So that's the first question.And then, secondly, regarding to the video account advertising, could you clarify some feedback that you have heard from advertisers, maybe your return on investment, etc., and any area for further improvement? Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerYeah. Thank you, Eddie. So, in terms of the fewer domestic game licenses and change to our game development strategy, then, you know, we have indeed changed our game development strategy, although the full effects of the change will take a few quarters to show through. So, first of all, we're focusing our resources on, you know, fewer, bigger, higher-impact, higher production value, new games.And many of those new games also have global aspirations as opposed to purely single-country aspirations. Secondly, we are indeed spending more time and resources upgrading and energizing our existing games. And we talked at length about the example of CrossFire in the opening remarks. And then, thirdly, we actually do believe that there will be further issuance of new game licenses in the nearer future.And so, to some extent, this headwind to the game industry will mitigate as more new games are released. Secondly, on your question around advertiser response to the in-feed ads on the video accounts, you know, I would say that the first noteworthy point is that video accounts actually deliver quite a differentiated audience who, by and large, are not consuming either short-form video services. And so, in comparison to the rest of the industry, where there is a very high overlap between use of service A and service B and service C and service D, in video accounts is a differentiated audience and, you know, advertisers like that because they can reach people whom they otherwise weren't able to reach on incumbent platforms. And that, in turn, has meant that the video accounts, particularly popular with advertisers who value that additional reach, such as fast-moving consumer goods companies and such as high-end brands, which in turn has meant that the eCPM that we're achieving on the video accounts is very robust.It's at a premium to any of the incumbents, and it's also a premium to Weixian moments. Now, in terms of areas for improvement, from an advertiser feedback, the key area for improvement in their eyes is simply that we -- that they would like to purchase more inventory. And therefore, they would like us to release more inventory, which we are periodically doing. But right now, we're in an excess demand situation.Thank you.Eddie Leung -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystThank you.Wendy Huang -- Macquarie ResearchThank you, Eddie. Our next question comes from Alicia Yap from Citigroup. [Inaudible]Alicia Yap -- Citi -- AnalystHi. Good evening, management. Can you hear me?Wendy Huang -- Macquarie ResearchYes, we can.Alicia Yap -- Citi -- AnalystOK. Yeah. Thank you for taking my questions. Congrats on the solid profit beats and also the Meituan dividend.I have two questions. First one on the online advertising. We observed that the ad budget as related to the event sponsorship and also the brand awareness campaign seems to be experience a little bit more stable. But your allocation lately as compared to the [Inaudible] dollars in the past few years.So, given Tencent's diversified media properties across, you know, for example, Tencent music, video accounts, the moments, will these actually position Tencent to have a stronger value proposition to gain more advertising share when the economy gradually rebound? My follow-up question is on the gaming. So, we also noticed -- I'm not sure if we are correct -- it seems like the PC game, this shows a little bit more resilient in retaining the existing gamers and also attracting some of the return gamers. So, will we actually also reallocate more development resource to introduce more content update on some of the older PC games to revive the gamers' interest? Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerThank you, Alicia. So, on the advertising question, then, you know, in general, the China online advertising market is primarily -- predominantly performance ads and then, a minority of branded ads. And then, within the performance ads, there's contractual performance advertising where, you know, the advertiser desires performance measured by sort of traditional awareness and reach metrics, as well as transactional metrics. And then, there's more purely transactional performance advertising where the advertiser is very purely focused on transactional metrics.And that would be true for, you know, perhaps mobile game companies, e-commerce companies, and so forth. And I think, you know, that Tencent plays across all of those. Obviously, our historic strength is more within the branded advertising. But in recent years, as we have nurtured a very substantial gross merchandise volume flow through our many programs, then we have created more sort of native, endemic demand for performance advertising, both contractual performance and transactional performance.And then, more recently, with the release of advertising inventory in video accounts and in the future advertising inventory within our search engine, then we think we have the right inventory that is especially suitable for the transactional performance advertisers. So, historically, we were sort of most suited to the branded advertisers and the contractual performance advertisers. But increasingly, we have both the use case and the ad inventory that is suitable for transactional performance advertisers. And then, on your game question around PC games then, yes, we are, as I mentioned in response to Eddie's question, you know, investing more in our big, existing games.It's also the case that we have a number of, you know, PC games in development globally. And, you know, some of them are pretty substantial. So, you know, Riot's Valorant is a PC-first game and, you know, that's become one of the most successful PC games across the industry, both in terms of critical reception but also in terms of becoming a, you know, $1 billion annual revenue franchise. And then, you know, many of the game studios we have acquired in the past five years outside China, PC game first.If you look at Steam today, I think that the No. 2 title behind Call of Duty is Warhammer 40,000: Dark Tide, which is created by a studio called Fatshark in Europe and in Sweden. That is one of our subsidiaries. And that game actually hasn't launched yet.But it's, you know, the No. 2 or No. 3 game in Steam rankings. So, anyway, we -- China's studios have become somewhat mobile first.And, you know, for them, when they release PC games, it's often a situation where the game is released across both mobile and PC and interoperable. But the game is sort of crafted with mobile front of mind versus many of our overseas studios, like Riot and Fatshark, you know, PC first and then move the PC game to other platforms later. Thank you.Wendy Huang -- Macquarie ResearchThank you, Alicia. Our next question comes from Gary Yu from Morgan Stanley. Gary, your line's open.Gary Yu -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystHi. Thank you for the opportunity and congratulation on the strong results. I have two questions. First one is a follow-up on video accounts.I think you mentioned video accounts seems to be complementary to our Weixin ad platform and also kind of differentiated by modest short video peers. So, when this platform becomes a bigger kind of ad revenue pour, how should we think about where the ad budgets are going to come -- you know, coming from? Is it more from other short-video peers, you know, other formats ads? And then, you know, by that time, should we expect inevitably some -- some kind of cannibalization on our existing kind of ads revenue from other platform? And then a follow-up question is related to our investment portfolio. Given our criteria is to consider divestment when subsidiary -- when the associates become more kind of financially capable in strength with, you know, industry leadership, when I look at the rest of the portfolio, it seems like there are some other sizable associates which have reached that kind of status or definition. So, how should we think about, you know, those associates that we are, you know -- which are, you know, approaching data Meituan, kind of mature stage? Thank you.Martin Lau -- PresidentSo, in terms of video accounts, right now, I think, clearly, as we have seen from the evidence, that the monetization is actually incremental for us. There are a number of aspects of it. Number one is that the time that people spend on video accounts is actually purely incremental and it's actually a very sizable amount. That's one.And two is, in terms of the revenue, we saw the budget as being incremental because, you know, when we start scaling the video accounts revenue, it actually reached a significant scale. And in fact, we talked about it's on track to reach RMB 1 billion per quarter. And so, that ramp-up is actually achieved without impacting any other of our advertising revenue or advertising budget as put in by the advertisers. And we also view video accounts as very complementary to our ecosystem as it actually works very well with our mini programs, as well as other parts of our ecosystem, including official accounts, including WeCom.The ecosystem as a whole actually help the merchants to build a private domain for them. And in the past, the merchants can only bring traffic to the mini programs through offline touchpoints and some advertising on our Weixin ecosystem. But now, the video accounts actually allowed a considerable amount of inventories to be added. And the traffic can be through video accounts that can be through video accounts like streaming.And that actually allows the merchants to really bring much more traffic into their mini programs. And that, as a whole, really complements the overall ecosystem of Weixin. And in terms of where the revenue would be coming in, you know, I think part of it is actually from existing revenue that's spent on other short video platforms. Some of the revenue will be actually coming from e-commerce, right, because as the merchants want to build their private domain, they may actually look at the spending that they put in -- on other channels and try to build something which is of highest value to them, which we believe private domain is.And -- and it also involves some of our existing advertisers who are spending more money on our platform.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerAnd, Gary, in terms of your question around this strategic thinking around distribution and, you know, comparing the Meituan distribution with the prior JD distribution, then, if you look at the Meituan announcement on Page 7, there's a section called Reasons for and Benefits of distribution in kind. It's actually distribution in specie. I'm not sure how to pronounce specie, so I will say distribution in kind. And there, we give, you know, three criteria, which are among the criteria we consider when we're deciding whether it's appropriate to distribute an investment.And one of those criteria is the financial strength of the investee. A second one is the industry positioning of the investee. And the third one is our investment return. And so, if you look at, you know, Meituan, for example, through -- through that lens, then, you know, in terms of industry positioning, it's obviously, you know, extremely strong being, you know, the clear leader and food delivery and in-store and so forth.If you look at the investment returns, then we've had very good returns on the investment of around 30% IRR. And if you look in terms of financial profile, then, you know, it is profitable. It's not as profitable on a headline basis as JD was when we distribute it. But that's because Meituan, as you well know, is investing in a community group buying and other new services to expand its addressable market longer term.So anyway, those are three of the criteria that help explain our thinking around distributions and, you know, specifically why we chose to distribute JD and why we now choose to distribute Meituan. Thank you.Martin Lau -- PresidentAnd I would add to the fact that we -- we obviously want to distribute the shares from a point of strength, right, you know, as we look at what -- what James talked about in terms of a strength in financial profile and industry position. And at the same time, when we look at the shareholder base, we actually see, from an institutional investor's perspective, there's actually a very big overlap of the biggest shareholders between us and Meituan, which means that there will be a lot of institutional investors who want to get the Meituan shares. And at the same time, as -- as we look at an investment like Meituan, we actually made a very big financial gain from it already. And that's why we would like to allow our shareholders to start making their own decisions about what to do with the shares.But I would say, as I, you know, talk about, you know, a lot of that, there's a lot of overlap in terms of the biggest institutional investors. And I also believe that some investors may actually want to sell the shares. But a lot of the investors would be probably like me, right, who will be holding on to the majority of Meituan shares for a very long period of time because I'm actually very excited about the prospect of the company.Wendy Huang -- Macquarie ResearchThank you, Gary. Our next question comes from Robin Zhu of Bernstein.Robin Zhu -- AllianceBernstein -- AnalystThank you. Thanks, management, for taking my question. I guess a couple of things. Just, one, if we take a step back on -- on, you know, returning cash to shareholders, beyond this kind of periodic big distributions, how should we think about the sort of run rates of cash returns? You raised the run rates of buybacks a couple of weeks before the blackout for these results.Is that -- should we think of that as kind of the new sustainable level? And would management ever consider announcing a formal cash payout policy, you know, incentive free cash flow or -- or anything like that? So, that's -- that's one. And then, two, obviously, there's been a lot of progress made on cutting costs and scaling back different bits of the business. Be curious to hear how you think about when to go on the front foot again to start spending more money on driving more growth and how we switch from where we are now to -- to that. Thank you.Martin Lau -- PresidentIn terms of capital allocation, I would say we're not a utility, right? We are a growth-driven company. So, I would say we're not going to have a return or dividend yield-driven thinking in our capital allocation. So, if you look at the three sources of capital return that we talked about, one is dividend, the other one is share buyback. And -- and then, we talked about the distribution in kind.Each one of them is actually of a different nature. I think, you know, in terms of the dividend, it is a program, and we have been distributing about 10% of our non-IFRS earning. And over time, we may actually increase that, depends on what -- you know, how we look at the reinvestment opportunities. But then, share buyback is actually a way for us to return the excess cash flow, and that would be calibrated against investment opportunities, investing in other people, other companies' shares.And it is true that given the industry now, environment right now, we are being more selective in terms of buying investments. So, that's why we actually have more cash to conduct share buyback and especially when our shares is actually very attractively valued given our -- our strong operations, cash flow generation as well, as we actually have a basket of investment portfolio which is also assured by actually getting us more exposure to that. So, that's why, this year, we have actually stepped up our share buyback in a pretty significant way, but we actually manage it in a dynamic way. In terms of the distribution in kind, that's actually more a case-by-case basis and that the reasons and considerations, I think, James had already talked very clearly about.So, those are all of different natures. Overall, we do not want to have a target yield. But at the same time, I think we're very thoughtful and we are very proactive in terms of returning capital to the shareholders as we see fit in order to maximize the shareholder return. Now, in terms of the investments, I would say -- I would refer you to Page 4 of our strategy section.I think, you know, we actually talked about the fact that we have a very strong cash flow generation capability, as well as a very large holding of liquid assets in order for them to be more than enough to fund our organic growth, strategic growth, as well as our capital return to the shareholders. So, we have more resources than we need to do all these things at the same time, and they don't actually conflict with each other. Thank you.Wendy Huang -- Macquarie ResearchThank you. Our next question comes from Natalie Wu of Haitong International.Natalie Wu -- Haitong International Securities -- AnalystHi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I have two as well. The first one is regarding the regulation.I think that there are some easing signs on the regulatory environment in China these days. So, just wondering, any updates on recent regulation developments that can be assessed from company side and how should that affect your fundamentals next year? And second question regarding the -- your enterprise services. Just wondering how should we think of the monetization potential for your enterprise app family, including Tencent Meeting enterprise, WeChat, etc. Will it be material contribution in one to three years? Thank you.Martin Lau -- PresidentSo, on the regulation side, in the last earnings call, we actually updated you that the recent regulatory direction is actually trending toward supporting healthy development of the industry to complete the ratification and also to carry out normalized deregulation. So, based on the recent government communications, I think it basically confirms this direction continues. More noticeably, we noticed, for example, in the party congress report, it mentioned that China will accelerate the development of the digital economy and further integrate it with the real economy as a measure to drive high-quality growth. Also, after that, in a late October NDRC report, recognizes the achievement of the digital economy in the past decade.And the report also advocates a digital economy of greatest strength, of quality and scale, by developing digital technology and integrating that into real economy. So, all in all, the direction, I think, we feel is still very consistent with what we said last time. And I think what's changed is that, in particular, there are some steps and some regulatory approvals that signals a more normalized regulatory environment that confirms this regulatory direction. So, this include in the fintech area, we have received approval for our investment in Samsung Property and Casualty Insurance Company in China.In the online gaming area, we have received approval for a new Banhao and also a Banhao amendment in September. And we do expect to receive more Banhaos in the coming future. And in the area of investments and also antitrust, we received SAMR approval for a JV with China Unicom. So, all these specific actions and approvals actually signifies that, I think, the overall regulatory environment is actually trending toward a more supportive environment.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerAnd, Natalie, on your question about whether our enterprise services would bring material revenue contribution in one to three years, then, you know, the future is uncertain, but I think it's unlikely we would see a material revenue contribution to our total revenue within one year. Over the longer term, then, we believe these services, you know, will lend themselves to good monetization. And if you look at the experience of Zoom and Slack and Teams and so forth, I think that speaks to that longer-term opportunity. You know, how quickly we get from that near-term situation where we're focused primarily on distribution to the longer-term opportunity around monetization is partly a function of the competitive landscape.And so, that's the situation that we're in today. As Martin mentioned, we do have a paid subscription product bundling, Tencent Meeting, WeCom, Tencent Docs together, and that's seeing some good early adoption by larger enterprises. But we view this as, you know, something with a longer gestation cycle versus our video accounts and international game initiatives that are turning into material revenue more immediately. Thank you.Wendy Huang -- Macquarie ResearchThank you. Our next question comes from John Choi of Daiwa.John Choi -- Daiwa Capital Markets -- AnalystOK. Thank you very much for taking my question. I have -- on the question about -- I think, last quarter, you guys said that your business is a lot more cyclical than before given that the nature of our core businesses are now more on the -- highly correlated with the economy. So, as we are seeing some improvements, you know, signals in the macro and also the COVID situation, along with, you know, external factors improving, are we seeing better visibility in some areas like advertising, you know, and fintech and business services as we go into later this year, early this year or early next year? Does that mean we should see, you know, a better tailwind as we, you know, see for these cyclical businesses? And quick follow-up about your business services.You know, I appreciate that you guys are doing a lot more on the -- you see, this quarter, we've seen gross profit increase both sequentially and also on an annual basis. But how should we think about the margins more in the mid to long term, you know, if you compare to ourself versus our global peers? Thank you.Martin Lau -- PresidentI think, in terms of the macro, third quarter was actually quite good because there is a recovery from the second quarter in which there were a lot of lockdowns. But then, I think the beginning of the fourth quarter was a little bit clouded again due to more sporadic lockdowns around the country. So, I think the short term would probably be still quite volatile. But I think, overall, you know, we do believe, in the, you know, medium term, the economy would definitely start to improve.And as a result, we're confident about the medium term. But for now, I think, you know, it's going to be a little bit volatile in this period of time.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerI think, on the business services question, that the situation in China from a margin perspective is so dissimilar to the situation in the rest of the world that it's hard to draw analogies. You know, generally speaking, the rest of the world, the companies that provide infrastructure as a service, such as Amazon and Google, are not -- don't have very substantial software-as-a-service businesses. And then, there's companies like Oracle that, you know, provide software as a service with -- with less infrastructure. And, you know, of course, Microsoft does bridge the gap.But, you know, for comparison, in China, there's several big companies that do infrastructure platform and software as a service together, including ourselves. So, that's one difference. And other difference is the competitive behavior is dissimilar. You know, think, in the Western world, when web services were growing very quickly, margins were expanding.And now, as the web services revenue growth slows, there's some pressure on margins as the companies fight more intensely for market share. In China, it's the other way around. When the industry was growing very quickly, then margins were very weak and, in some cases, declining because everyone was jumping into -- to try and grab that slice of the pie and maximize that slice of the pie versus now, with a more difficult environment that the industry has been in for the last year, you actually see in some cases, including our own, that a weaker revenue is accompanied by stronger margins as we've refocused on the most sustainable and highest-quality businesses within -- within the business services mix. Thank you.Wendy Huang -- Macquarie ResearchThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ronald Keung from Goldman Sachs.Ronald Keung -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystThank you. Thank you, Pony, Martin, James, and John. First, want to ask about fintech because we read about this. You noted that double-digit growth in commercial payments.So, as our business continues to have profits driven from kind of games as to fintech, now, how is that progress in the financial holdco restructuring? And is that on track? And what our latest strategies in kind of across these commercial payment, wealth management, and lending businesses in this macro environment, and particularly given the change in COVID measures this year and next year. Thank you.Martin Lau -- PresidentSo, in terms of the financial holding company, we do believe that we would want to embrace having a financial holding company license. And we are in the process of understanding the requirements, interacting very closely with the regulators, and also make the requisite preparation for it, because we do see that the regulatory oversight and potential opportunities of having a financial holding company license is beneficial, and the internal organization changes that need to happen were not really causing material impact to the business. So, we -- we are working proactively on that. But at this point in time, we don't really have an update for you yet.When we have an update, we'll let you know. In terms of the payment business, as well as the financial services business, I would say it's actually very important for us to focus on a few things, right? You know, No. 1 is really compliance. And we have spent a lot of time in making sure that all the services are actually complying with the new regulatory requirement and review.And, you know, all on the way, we have actually spent a lot of time in working on compliance. But the requirements have been going up as required by regulators, and we have been spending a lot of resources and effort to -- to upgrade our compliance, and especially, this is a big challenge given the scale of the service that we have. But I think we have really been able to achieve that. And second is really about risk management because, given a challenging regulatory macro environment, it's actually very important for us to manage risks in a very proactive way.And thirdly is actually leveraging our payments services, which connects with a lot of offline merchants, and especially small and medium merchants, so that we can actually help them to cope with the challenges on the macro side and then help them to generate more business. And we also have a rebate program so that would actually help them with these difficult periods. We actually felt that once we go through with the -- this period of sporadic lockdowns, and, from time to time, there's actually challenges on the offline side, we should actually return to a pretty good backdrop of organic growth. And the payment would actually help to generate business for our lending business, as well as for our wealth management business.So, I think, over the longer -- mid to long term, it's actually with good potential. But right now, I think it's actually very important for us to work through this -- this relatively challenging period.Ronald Keung -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystGot it. Thank you, Martin. And maybe a follow-up question on our returning capital to shareholders. So, after JD and Meituan, I think most of our positions investments are now either not Hong Kong-listed stocks or maybe relatively smaller in size.So, I think -- how should we think about the future strategies for the investment portfolio? Particularly, how do we balance the recycle of capital for ourselves in reinvesting into areas of growth? You mentioned about software companies or international games versus kind of distributing to shareholders. How do we balance these -- these two?James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerI think it's Martin spoke to in his introductory comments, you know, we don't -- we don't necessarily need to do it because we do generate $15 billion of free cash flow a year. And so, if the $15 billion of free cash flow has been fully sufficient, you know, not only to fund our investments in our own infrastructure and, you know, our own new products, as well as investments in other companies that are complementary to us, such as Ubisoft and FromSoftware, but also to fund a very heavy volume of buybacks on top. And then, you know, the distributions in kind, you know, a separate incremental return of capital to shareholders that will be more periodic in nature rather than continual. Thank you.Ronald Keung -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystThank you, James.Wendy Huang -- Macquarie ResearchThank you. Our next question comes from Charlene Liu of HSBC.Charlene Liu -- HSBC -- AnalystSo, I have two question. The first one is regarding our cloud business. Tencent Cloud business recently set up a JV with China Unicom. Can management discuss the rationale for this collaboration, how it can benefit the company's cloud business? And also, should we expect increasing collaboration with SOEs sort of going forward? That's the first question.For the second question, I would like to sort of point out that, you know, in the past couple of months, Tencent has stepped up share buyback to offset the slowdown to pressure from Prosus. And we also, you know, observe that the share prices responded quite favorably to reports that Tencent is potentially taking over the Prosus even though it was subsequently being denied. Can we seek your thoughts on what you would consider a favorable outcome for Tencent in this sort of slowdown Prosus? Could you shed light on sort of do you have a preferred type of strategic, you know, shareholder, etc.? Thank you very much.Martin Lau -- PresidentWell, so, for the JV with China Unicom, it's actually focused on distributing CDN and multi-edge computing products that's co-developed by Tencent and Unicom. So, it's a joint force in order to leverage our development capability resources, as well as customer base, in order to promote these products. And we believe the business would have good prospects going forward. But right now, that -- the business plan is still being drawn up, and the short-term financial benefits will be limited.In terms of the significance, I would say that the approval from SAMR is actually more of a significant event for us on this particular JV. And in terms of finding collaboration partners, you know, we actually work on it on a case-by-case basis, looking at the business case, as well as what are the resources that each party can actually bring to the table. And I think there is no specific trend toward whether it's a private company or SOEs or any sector that we -- we look at these opportunities on a case-on-case basis.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerOn your question around, you know, whether we have stepped up share buybacks to offset the slowdown from Prosus and, you know, what a favorable outcome to all of this would be, then, it is factually correct that during the last trading window, our buyback volume was similar to slightly greater than the Prosus slowdown volume during the same trading days. But I want to emphasize that, you know, we have been a listed company for a long time, and we've very frequently bought back shares when the share prices declined sharply in our history as a listed company, irrespective of whether, you know, Naspers or anyone else was, you know, selling shares or not selling shares at the time. So, the buyback decision is, you know, primarily around, you know, where we see value and much more so than around flow issues. To put it another way, in the very short term, if a shareholder sells X amount of shares and we buy back Y amount of shares, then, you know, of course, that's superficially net neutral from a flow perspective.But from a value perspective, which is what we care about, it's value accretive because the shareholder who's selling shares is not actually increasing the share count. Versus when we buy back shares, we do cancel the shares, we buy back, therefore, decrease the share counts. And so, that's, you know, value accretion for our remaining shareholders over time. You know, I think that in terms of favorable outcomes, there's a decision for Prosus.But, you know, Prosus has stated that it views this as a -- an exercise that's necessitated by the abnormally large discount to NAV which Prosus was trading when it announced this exercise. And, you know, that discount to NAV narrowed somewhat, and Prosus has said that should the discount to NAV narrowed at certain levels, then, there could be changes to this policy. So anyway, it's something that, you know, we're obviously very aware of, but it's not a primary consideration for us in when we're looking at our capital return policy, including our buyback activity. Thank you.Charlene Liu -- HSBC -- AnalystUnderstood. Thank you.Wendy Huang -- Macquarie ResearchThank you, Charlene. We should take the last question from Alex Yao of J.P. Morgan.Alex Yao -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- AnalystGood evening and thank you, management, for taking my question. Two questions from my side. First one is on the domestic gaming monetization this quarter. The domestic gaming revenue declined by 2% on a quarter-on-quarter basis against a positive seasonality and a new -- new game launch.What caused this such a normal seasonality in this quarter? And then, secondwise, on the interplay between monetization of video accounts and the content ecosystem of the video accounts, has -- you guys observed the monetization of video accounts helped the content ecosystem [Inaudible] video accounts at all. I understand this is still an early stage of the monetization, but intuitively, I think improving monetization capability of the ecosystem should introduce more financial incentive to the content creators. So, therefore, it should be positive to the content ecosystem. Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerAlex, so, on your first question, I may not have understood it exactly, but the short answer is there's a different seasonality for our game cash flows versus game reported revenue. However, in previous years, when the overall industry and we within it were growing quickly, and that seasonality was not apparent as it is this year when the industry has been in stagnation. So, to get more granular and specific, you know, the gaming industry in China typically sees a peak in terms of cash flow generation grossing receipts during the Chinese New Year period. And we then amortize those cash flow receipts into our P&L over a period of several months.And so, the cash flow, the receipts strength in the Chinese year translates into reported revenue strength in Q1 to an extent, but more in Q2, and then also in Q3 before decaying toward the end of the year. And again, in previous years, that seasonality hasn't been as obvious as it is this year. So -- so, you know, that's basically the short answer to your question that when you look at the sequential trend for game revenue from Q2 to Q3, it is somewhat influenced by the fact that in Q2 we capture more of the Chinese New Year peak spend in our reported revenue. And then, as we go through the back half of the year, that -- that fades away due to the approval cycle.Martin Lau -- PresidentSo in terms of the content ecosystem and monetization, I would say, at this stage, the monetization does not really have a lot of impact on the content ecosystem. But having said that, the content ecosystem has been -- become richer and richer and has been consistently built up for video content, primarily because of the fact that the traffic has been increasing and our targeting technology has been improving so that we can actually allocate the traffic more specifically to the different content providers. And the content providers, once they start to accumulate users and once they start tapping traffic, you know, they can actually monetize one way or the other on their own. And our in-feeds ads is actually independent from that.But over the long term, I think there's going to be more interaction between the two because once we start having livestreaming e-commerce, then basically, a lot of the content providers would actually also have livestreaming. And when they start doing e-commerce and when there are a lot of merchants looking for content developers who also want to do livestreaming, they want to look for streamers, then they would start advertising within our video accounts and that will bring traffic to the livestreamers. And as a result of that, they can actually generate more revenue. So, I think, you know, over the longer term, monetization and the content ecosystem would actually have a stronger interaction and more conducive relationship.Wendy Huang -- Macquarie ResearchThank you, everyone.

            "description": "Tencent, which operates China\u2019s largest social media network and is the world\u2019s largest games company by revenue, generated $5.5 billion (RMB51.6 billion) of profit in the third quarter of its financial year. That was earned from gross revenues of $19.7 billion (RMB140 billion).The July to September numbers represented a 2% year-on-year decrease in revenue and a 3% year-on-year decrease in profits. Using the group\u2019s preferred non-IFRS accounting method profits were up 3% to $4.7 billion (RMB33.4 billion).\u201cDuring the third quarter, we started to benefit from the adjustments that we have made to reposition ourselves for a new industry paradigm. We activated in-feed advertisements in video accounts, achieved breakthroughs in international games publishing, and executed cost efficiency initiatives which re-focused us on core activities and controlled our cost growth. As a result, we achieved year-over-year growth in non-IFRS earnings after four quarters of decline,\u201d said Pony Ma Huateng, Tencent\u2019s chairman and CEO.The results were nevertheless scarred by the impact of economic slowdown and regulatory hurdles \u2013 even if the group says it sees signs of regulatory headaches easing.Subscription revenues decreased 3% to RMB72.7 billion in the quarter. The company\u2019s Chinese games business declined by 7% to RMB31.2 billion and online advertising weakened by 5% to RMB21.5 billion.Social networks revenues decreased by 2% to RMB29.8 billion, reflecting increased revenues from video accounts live streaming service and music subscription service, but slightly outweighed by decreased revenues from music- and games-related live streaming services and at the Tencent Video subscription service.Tencent Video, China\u2019s biggest streaming service, saw subscriptions drop by 2 million since June to 120 million at the end of September. It blamed this on \u201ccontent scheduling delays,\u201d and noted that average revenue per subscriber rose due to price increases. Content highlights in the period included self-commissioned drama series \u201cLove Like the Galaxy,\u201d which ranked first by video views across all online platforms in China.In the games businesses Tencent saw decreased revenues from \u201cHonour of Kings\u201d and \u201cPeacekeeper Elite,\u201d influenced by China\u2019s minor protection measures, balanced out by incremental revenues from recently launched \u201cLeague of Legends: Wild Rift,\u201d \u201cReturn to Empire,\u201d and \u201cLeague of Legends Esports Manager.\u201dAmong the other positives were the performance of the group\u2019s financial and business services operations and the continued incremental growth of the social media platform WeChat-Weixin, which surpassed 1.3 billion users worldwide.The group said that it will cut the majority of its stake in Meituan, the separately-listed delivery and group shopping service. It will offer Meituan shares as an in-kind dividend to Tencent shareholders.On a conference call following publication of the results, management said that it has shifted its games strategy towards fewer, but larger titles that can have a bigger impact and international reach. Its Chinese games business would improve if one of three things were to change: an increase in licence approvals by the government, an easing of the minors\u2019 protection measures, or a general macro-economic upturn.Management suggested that, after some two years of regulatory tightening within China, there are growing signs of normality. These include a cautious resumption of games licensing and recent approval for a joint venture with mobile telecoms group China Unicom, which could be read as an easing of the government\u2019s anti-trust crackdown on the country\u2019s tech giants.Tencent\u2019s shares have been on a roller-coaster ride. They tumbled by more than 70% from their all-time peak in February 2021 to recent lows at the end of October, as result of the combined effect of regulation, China\u2019s tough anti-COVID measures and the measures impact on the direction of the Chinese economy.But in the last two weeks the stock has surged by nearly 50% from HK$200 to HK$294 per share, following vaguely positive interpretations of the Communist Party conference, slightly eased COVID restrictions (despite rising case numbers) and renewed optimism about China\u2019s international relations.",

            "description": "In July 2022, the first images from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) were released, causing a sensation. Infrared photos showed planets, stars and galaxies in unprecedented detail, going viral online and still making headlines around the world.With interest in science and astronomy at a high, we hosted an International Deep Space Dialogue at the Tencent WE Summit 2022. Now in its 10th year, the Summit serves to highlight the most ambitious scientific work being done around the world.Distinguished speakers for this dialogue included Nobel Prize laureate Dr. John C. Mather, Senior Project Scientist at the JWST; Dr. Zhan Hu, Project Scientist for the Optical Facility of the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST), Chinese Academy of Sciences; and Dr. Deng Dafu, Deputy General Manager of Tencent IEG Cros and AI expert for the CATCH program.In the spirit of collaboration that underpins the Summit, this is the first dialogue among the three programs. Joining them was a student and amateur astronomer Zhou Zezhen, winner of the young category of Astronomical Photographer of the Year by the Royal Observatory Greenwich.The dialogue was moderated by Prof. Gou Lijun, a research fellow at NAOC.Diverse Space Programs, Complementary MissionsThe JWST, with a diameter of 6.5m, is the largest optical telescope in space. Launched on December 25, 2021, the telescope is a joint project involving 20 countries, and uses infrared photography to study light from distant universes. Dr. Mather says that \u201cit is observing everything, from the first stars and galaxies and black holes to planets in the solar system.\u201dScheduled for launch in the next year or two will be the CSST \u2013 a two-meter aperture-wide field space telescope \u2013 into the same low earth orbit as that of the Space Station. Dr. Zhan explains that the CSST\u2019s primary mission is \u201cto carry out high-resolution, large area multiband imaging and spectral surveys using a camera that will be the largest one in space.\u201dMeanwhile, CATCH will launch a fleet of smart satellites outfitted with X-ray telescopes to observe multiple space phenomena such as black holes, neutron stars, gamma ray bursts and supernovas. The satellites use AI calculations to make observations, and notify other satellites in the fleet to watch a target around the clock if something of interest is picked up.Frontier Technology Brings Complex ChallengesBuilding the JWST presented unique challenges that took years to overcome. Dr. Mather describes it as an \u201corigami telescope\u201d because of the way it had to be folded for launch. The engineering was \u201cextremely ambitious\u201d and required the development of 10 new technologies to focus the telescope after launch, piece the telescope together out of 18 hexagons, ensure the sunshades worked, and invent new kinds of infrared detectors.\u201cWe had to design it, build it and test it, and when it didn\u2019t work, had to start all over again. Finally, after four tests, it worked,\u201d says Dr. Mather.For the yet-to-launch CSST, the project team is working to finalize mission parameters. They have not yet determined which celestial objects will be observed and how to disseminate the vast quantity of data that will be collected. According to Dr. Zhan, CSST is mainly a survey telescope. It can be used for observing nearby galaxies such as M31, a very beautiful and large galaxy, and nearby dwarf galaxies as well as galaxy clusters. Similar to the JWST, the CSST can use galaxy clusters to study strong lensing effects, and Zhan\u2019s team expects to get more solid observations next year.CATCH uses reinforcement learning to help AI solve longstanding conundrums. However, it must first conduct intensive testing to overcome high training and deployment costs, limited interpretability and the lack of learning, historical experience and data that is the foundation of algorithms.Going Where No Human Has Gone BeforeEach project solves problems and uses technology that allows astronomers to see and do things for the first time and learn about things that have long puzzled humanity.The JWST uses infrared so it can see the most distant universes, or objects that are too cool to emit visible light, and inside clouds of glowing gas and dust where stars are born.This allowed the JWST team to observe planets around other stars, and learn that some planets have water vapor in their atmosphere. They have observed black holes and star-forming regions, including the spectacular Carina Nebula.Compared to ground telescopes, the CSST will have the advantage of high angular resolution and wavelength coverage, along with a large area of sky coverage of one square degree. It may not sound like much, but gives CSST a high-resolution field of vision that is 10,000 times greater than an optical ground telescope.We know that game technology has real world applications. Now we can see how it can help deep space exploration. The CATCH project uses game AI developed by Tencent Games to help satellites estimate the space environment and carry out observations in an intelligent, coordinated manner. It does so by treating celestial objects as agents, and applies corresponding algorithms to find an optimal solution.A Platform For the Next Generation of Scientists and AstronomersZhou Zezhen, a Chinese middle school student, displayed a sound grasp of astronomy and asked probing questions of the senior panel. He directed a question to Dr. Mather about how the JWST studies black holes, dark matter and dark energy, given they are effectively invisible.Dr. Mather replied that the JWST can detect their presence through gravitational effects. The gravity of galaxies bends light, indicating the presence of dark matter, which is deduced rather than observed, allowing us to know about faraway galaxies.Astute questions were also directed at Dr. Zhan about the advantages of the CSST compared to existing ground telescopes, and to Dr. Deng about how he came up with the idea to apply game AI to a space mission and how to train the AI for such a mission.Making an Impact and Helping Scientific Development Through Ideas ExchangeWith the launch of CSST on the horizon, Dr. Zhan and other scientists were keen to hear insights from Dr. Mather about how to maximize the impact of the project and the huge investment into getting it off the ground.Dr. Mather\u2019s response was clear and simple: \u201cshare the data and ask for help.\u201d He went on to elaborate that \u201cthe more you can publish your data and have other people analyze it, the more interesting it will be.\u201dHe outlined how the effort and skills required to build a telescope or observatory are different from those needed to analyze the data and make interesting discoveries, and the JWST is open to proposals and partnerships from any astronomer or scientist around the world.Dr. Mather also had a message for young people such as Zhou, saying that astronomers have a wide understanding of physics and engineering, making them highly qualified for scientific and technical fields, especially in data analysis.He concluded on an optimistic note, reflecting the current enthusiasm for science and astronomy. \u201cIt\u2019s a very exciting time to be an astronomer because we have new equipment, which means new discoveries.\u201d With them, \u201cmany, many things are possible.\u201dIn addition to this dialogue, the WE Summit 2022 also hosted several dialogues between Chinese teenagers and Thomas Lindahl, Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, and considered the father of DNA repair; Jiang Peng, a researcher at the NAOC and chief designer of China Sky Eye, the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST); and other scientists. Such discussions have inspired the next generation of students to seek out, think about, and pursue science.More than 80 of the world\u2019s top scientists have attended the WE Summit over its 10-year history. They have shared cutting-edge scientific and technological information with the public, including theoretical physics, astronomical exploration, brain-computer interface, quantum computing, life science and other fields.",

Unfortunately, the announcement made no mention of a release date or window.Every IGN Monster Hunter Review 12 ImagesIGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! Welcome to 20 questions. Can you guess the game?Capcom has been busy with its monster-hunting franchise lately, releasing three Monster Hunter games in the last four years: Monster Hunter World (2018), Monster Hunter Rise (2021), and Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin (2022). World and Rise also received sizable expansions in 2020 and 2022, respectively.Monster Hunter World has been especially successful for Capcom. With 18.5 million copies sold, it's the publisher's best-selling game ever.

            "description": "The Monster Hunter series is one of the most common staples in gaming nowadays. Everyone at some point has played this series in which players take down several monsters. Well, a new entry in the series has been announced, and this time it will be a collaborative effort between Capcom and Tencent's own TiMi Studio Group.The game is going to be made primarily for mobile devices. It aims to basically reproduce the staples that the Monster Hunter series is widely known for, so you'll be able to hunt down mighty monsters from the comfort of your mobile device. However, the game will also bring its own unique experience that will be unique for mobile devices and phones.The press release by Capcom and TiMi states that the partnership will combine the experience and strengths of both sides, allowing Monster Hunter to scale to more platforms. This is done with the aim of giving global hunters - experienced or new - the freedom to hunt as they desire, anytime and anywhere.Not much else is known about this upcoming collaboration effort between Capcom and TiMi. However, TiMi Studio is certainly a studio that will provide a decent experience at least. They have worked in games like Call of Duty: Mobile and Pokemon UNITE. As such, it's easy to say that the developers have some field experience with other successful mobile games.As for what this new Monster Hunter's experience will be like? Well, it's fair to speculate that the game will have some sort of monetization on its structure. After all, Monster Hunter has always been defined by its armors with varying stats and visual flares. The mobile game will also probably bring a lot of familiar encounters from the series' history, so we'll likely see Rathalos or Mitzsune. This is just speculation, though, so stay tuned for more details from Capcom.The Capcom and TiMi Studio Group Monster Hunter game is currently in development.",

This news might make fans think immediately we\u2019re getting a \u201cGo!\u201d style game for mobile, but the developer behind those titles (Pokemon Go, Pikmin Bloom, etc) is Niantic. Timi has a track record of making mobile games, for sure, but they\u2019ve been more varied in gameplay type, at least, so here\u2019s hoping this Monster Hunter x Timi title is something interesting.Capcom hasn\u2019t announced a new console game in the series yet, but then Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak has only been out a short while on PC and Switch, so it\u2019s perhaps a little early to expect too much in the way of a new title from Capcom directly just yet. As for this new mobile title, who knows\u2026 maybe it\u2019ll use the visual stylings of the Stories series, which could arguably work better for mobile users. We\u2019ll have to wait and see.",

REUTERS/Stringer Acquire Licensing RightsSummaryCompanies Riot just unhappy with slow progress in parallel Chinese litigation, judge saysRiot parent Tencent also refused to participate in case(Reuters) - ByteDance's Shanghai Moonton Technology Co Ltd does not have to face Riot Games Inc's copyright lawsuit over allegations that Moonton copied parts of the mobile version of Riot's hit \"League of Legends,\" according to a ruling in Los Angeles federal court.West Los Angeles-based Riot's lawsuit was dismissed Tuesday because the dispute could adequately be heard in China and Riot's parent company, Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd, refused to join the case and provide crucial information, U.S. District Judge Michael Fitzgerald said.Fitzgerald said it was unclear which elements of the \"League of Legends\" game were made by Riot and which were made by Tencent, which is important to Moonton's defenses.It \"remains unfair to allow Riot and Tencent to bring a two-front war against Moonton unless and until Tencent decides to show up on both battlefields,\" Fitzgerald said.Fitzgerald said Riot could refile specific claims that do not survive in China in the U.S., but that its California lawsuit brought \"precisely the type of allegations that the Court already concluded can be adequately redressed in China.\"\"For years, the parties have been litigating highly related copyright claims in China that raise many of the same issues that Riot is now trying to re-raise in the U.S.,\u201d Moonton attorney Ajay Krishnan of Keker, Van Nest & Peters said in a statement. \"It would have been duplicative, inefficient, and wholly unfair to proceed with this case in the U.S., where Moonton would lack access to key evidence and witnesses.\"Riot's associate general counsel Dan Nabel said in an email that the company strongly disagrees with the decision and is considering an appeal.\"The idea of having U.S. citizens apply for M5 visas to fly overseas in order to ask a Chinese court for relief concerning works that were both created and infringed in the U.S. defies common sense,\" Nabel said.Riot sued Moonton in May, alleging Moonton's \"Mobile Legends: Bang Bang\" copies elements including user interfaces, characters designs and promotional materials from \"League of Legends: Wild Rift.\"Riot previously sued in the same court in 2017, alleging \"Bang Bang\" and other Moonton games copied from the computer version of \"League of Legends.\" Fitzgerald also dismissed that case after finding it would be better heard in China.\"The question is whether circumstances have truly changed from those that existed in 2017 or whether Riot simply seeks a second bite at the apple, unhappy with the progress (or lack thereof) in the still ongoing, parallel China litigation,\" Fitzgerald said Tuesday. \"The Court deems the latter to be the case.\"The case is Riot Games Inc v.

            "description": "The Human Tech Tree Unveils at Tencent's 10th anniversary of WE SummitTencent has introduced a new concept called the \u201cHuman Tech Tree\u201d at its WE Summit, an annual event to celebrate scientific and technological achievements and push the boundaries of human imagination. The Human Tech Tree represents the various branches and directions of scientific development, which intersect over time but share common roots.This is the 10th anniversary of the WE Summit, which brings together leading scientists and Nobel Prize winners from around the world with their eyes firmly focused on the future. They discuss the latest scientific discoveries and innovations and explore their practical impact on our lives and the future.Tencent Senior Vice President Leon Guo sat down to share his thoughts on the Human Tech Tree and what it means.By Leon GuoThe term Human Tech Tree represents something that dates back centuries. We achieve human progress by building on the scientific breakthroughs and achievements of the past, sprouting new branches on the foundations of those grown before. New knowledge and scientific progress can grow in many directions over time, but ultimately, they share a common root \u2013 science.Reviewing scientific achievements in human history is a daunting process. Each subject has its own pantheon and may cross disciplines while they develop, which often generates new breakthroughs. The Human Tech Tree represents the magnificent history of science and technology. It\u2019s such a huge project that no company can complete it alone.We recently began working with the Institute for the History of Natural Sciences and the National Science Library of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) to review the history of science and technology, filter key information from billions of academic papers and patents, and use artificial intelligence and immersive convergence technology to visualize the Human Tech Tree and all the scientific disciplines and developments it represents. Our core disciplines, the roots, are the foundation upon which past and future scientific discovery can grow. The branches of the tree symbolize how different scientific breakthroughs often intertwine, becoming part of the whole.The Human Tech Tree represents our collective growth as we build on the knowledge and understanding of the world around us.The Human Tech Tree Takes Root in ShenzhenYou\u2019ll be able to learn a lot more about the Human Tech Tree in the near future by visiting Shenzhen in southern China. We are planning to establish a museum at Qianhai to showcase science and technology development.The museum aims to help people learn about science and will feature innovative games to keep visitors engaged. It will also boast an interactive online tour that is enabled by our expertise in games, digital content, cloud, and AI.The museum will have four permanent exhibitions, room for temporary ones, and a cinema and multipurpose arena.We are excited to bring the joy and wonder of science and technology to people through the new museum.Science MattersAs we face ever-more challenging issues like climate change and sustainable development, it is increasingly important that we look to scientists to help us tackle these fundamental and existential problems.As part of our commitment to creating tech for good, our company has supported scientists and scientific research over the past decade through initiatives like the WE Summit and the Xplorer Prize.WE Summit has grown tremendously over the past 10 years, providing a platform to more than 80 leading scientists from around the world on topics ranging from theoretical physics and space exploration to brain-machine interfaces, quantum computing, new energy, and new materials.We\u2019ve witnessed some incredible developments and progress in science and technology globally since the first WE Summit 10 years ago. We\u2019ve also explored solutions for some critical challenges facing the future of humanity.Through the WE Summit, Tencent hopes to create a platform for international scientific collaboration, deliver scientific knowledge to the public, and encourage young people to participate in this exciting journey of scientific exploration.About WE Summit 2022Since its inception, WE Summit has been celebrating scientific achievement and discovery worldwide.In 2013, our founder, chairman and CEO Pony Ma kicked off the first WE Summit with a keynote speech on seven pointers to the future of the Internet. Since then, WE Summit has featured many notable speakers such as the late renowned physicist Stephen Hawking, and Nobel Laureates in Physics Sir Roger Penrose, Reinhard Genzel, Steven Weinberg, and Kip Thorne, as well as Alan Stern, Leader of NASA\u2019s New Horizons Mission, Pete Worden, former director of NASA Ames Research Center, and Zhenan Bao, the first Chinese female Dean at Stanford University.This year\u2019s WE Summit featured notable speakers such as Noble Prize laureates John C. Mather and Tomas Robert Lindahl, as well as other leading scientists including Li Jiangang, Yang Hong, Jiang Peng, Ye Cong, and Zhu Min.Dr. Mather is an American astrophysicist, cosmologist, and Nobel Prize in Physics laureate. At this year\u2019s WE Summit, he introduces James Webb Space Telescope, which took 20,000 people to build and over 20 years. It vastly improves on the older Hubble Space Telescope, with pictures taken by the telescope providing scientists with more evidence about space. Dr. Mather also discusses how the project encourages collaboration and teamwork, which drives scientists to do challenging but significant work.Dr. Lindahl is a Swedish-British biochemist specializing in cancer research. In his speech, he offers his thoughts on the process of scientific experimentation. Using an example from his work on the stability of nucleic acids, he explains how scientific breakthroughs are gained through many years of ongoing work. Through these examples, he wants to encourage budding scientists to seek all the opportunities and possibilities and to keep experimenting, because \u201cthere are a lot of things we still don\u2019t know about life and nature, and that makes it an exciting area to work in.\u201dLeveraging the rendering capabilities of our game engine, WE Summit 2022 will make the presentations film-like \"sci-fi blockbuster,\u201d allowing the audience to immerse themselves in the virtual Sun and China Space Station scenes. We will also offer the audience a 360\u00b0 view so that they can observe and understand the presentations about space and deep-diving better and can truly be inspired by science.We hope that scientific exploration becomes a cool, new fashion for people, especially the next generation.",

            "description": "The move is a significant departure from market-oriented economic policies of the last four decades, analysts say.In a major departure from the market-oriented economic policy of the past 40 years, the Chinese Communist Party is moving to take greater control of technology and telecoms companies, with a return to the era of \"joint ventures\" between the state and private sector.China's market regulatory body approved a new joint venture between the investment arm of state-owned telecoms giant China Unicom and tech giant Tencent, the agency said in an announcement on its official website last week.The joint venture was \"based on the strategic needs of the company\u2019s comprehensive advancement into the digital economy,\" according to statements filed by China Unicom to the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges.Tencent brings to the deal a massive amount of data gleaned from its WeChat super app that provides social media, payments and messaging services to 1.4 billion people in China and beyond.However, Unicom Innovation Venture Capital will hold a 48% stake compared with Tencent subsidiary Shenzhen Tencent Industry Venture Capital's 42% stake, the state-run Global Times newspaper reported.Meanwhile, the Shanghai subsidiary of China Mobile signed a strategic cooperation agreement on Nov. 1 with e-commerce giant JD.com's subsidiary JD Technology.The goal of that joint venture is smart city technology, digital governance, big data and communications, Shanghai Securities News reported.Sources familiar with the private sector in China said further similar deals are expected by year's end, with major private tech firms assigned a state-owned \"partner,\" meaning the state will effectively take control of at least some of their assets.The move follows a regulatory crackdown on privately owned tech giants in recent years.In July 2021, state-owned assets spokesman Peng Huagang said his agency would press ahead with \"mergers\" between private sector and state-owned companies, with takeovers implemented both by paid acquisitions and uncompensated nationalization, as well as share transfers.Huang Guangyu, chairman of GOME Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd., shown in this 2006 file photo, and his wife are selling off their shares in their private retail empire GOME. Credit: ReutersAccelerating nationalizationHangzhou-based scholar Chang Yu said the nationalization process now appears to be accelerating in the wake of the Chinese Communist Party's 20th National Congress last month.\"Everyone knows that this public-private 'partnership' only works in one direction,\" Chang told RFA. \"Even before the party congress, the government was moving against [what they termed] the disorderly expansion of capital, and stopped allowing private companies to expand.\"\"Now the party congress is over, they can speed up that process and take more drastic steps.\"Beijing-based commentator Wu Qiang said the moves are another indicator that Chinese leader Xi Jinping is taking China away from the market reforms introduced by late supreme leader Deng Xiaoping in 1979, and in the direction of a state-controlled economy similar to that of the Mao era.\"This heralds an era of a planned economy as mentioned in [Xi Jinping's] report to the 20th party congress,\" Wu told RFA. \"This will place private capital, particularly Tencent and JD.com, under the control of the government in Beijing.\"\"Looking at the shareholding structure, it seems to be a hybrid kind of joint venture driven by ideology,\" he said.Wu said it was made clear during the party congress that nobody should be lobbying to protect or endorse major private companies.\"The last protections and lobbying [attempts] for these huge online platforms have been removed,\" he said.Current affairs commentator Ma Ju said the purpose of the joint ventures was to ensure state control of resources and technology.\"The aim of the cooperation agreements between China Unicom and Tencent and China Mobile and JD.com is [state] control over the flow of information and materials,\" Ma told RFA. \"For [the Chinese Communist Party], anything relating to the internet is a matter of national security.\"\"They are controlling these companies in exactly the way they did back in 1953, through public-private 'partnerships,\u2019\" he said.Political commentator Jiang Feng said some private companies could eventually be eliminated.\"Private enterprises encourage a market economy, which goes against totalitarian rule, so they must be restricted or even eliminated,\" he told RFA's Asia Wants to Talk chat show.\"They are laying the groundwork for a command economy.\"China\u2019s wealthy looking for an outReports are emerging that China's wealthiest people are getting the message, with home electronics magnate Huang Guangyu and his wife selling off their shares in their private retail empire GOME, cashing out to the tune of H.K. $960 million (U.S. $122.3 million) and reducing the size of their stake from 51.5% to 42.8% across the course of this year.Nanjing-based retailer Xu Jing said many wealthy business owners are highly pessimistic about their future in China, and will leave if they can.\"Wanting to leave and being allowed to leave aren't necessarily the same thing ... because [entrepreneurs may now be] on a government [border] control list because they have a lot of debt,\" Xu said. \"Particularly real estate bosses.\"Changsha-based real estate insider Tian Hui gave a similar account. \"Business is not good now; earnings are low, yet expenditures are ongoing,\" he said. \"Returns are too slow, and there are bank loans [to pay back].\"\"[The wealthy] have been selling off famous artworks and properties ever since 2019, and they are taking the money to the United States to buy land and build properties there,\" he said.Scholar Ma Hong said in a joking reference to a 1980s Chinese rock anthem by Cui Jian, \"Rock and Roll on the New Long March.\"\"These rich people and bigwigs are all heading out on the new Long March, because now the government is promoting socialism in the new era,\" Ma said.Translated and edited by Luisetta Mudie.",

            "description": "In one late September video that I found particularly insightful, a person who appears to be a WeChat employee can be heard instructing people to put their hands in front of a recognition device and record their palm prints. \u201cNew feature of WeChat Pay. Everyone is welcome to try our service and support us,\u201d the voice says. In return, the users who scan their palms can get a soda for the price of one cent.The user who later uploaded the video asks when this feature was released, and the voice replies that it started half a year ago but only recently came to Guangzhou.The payment devices in these videos are iPad-size white boxes with one screen showing instructions and a camera capturing the palm data. It\u2019s unclear whether they are meant only for testing the functionality of palm-print recognition technology or for collecting more data to help fine-tune it (or both). None of the relevant videos indicate that customers are being told how their data will be used. I asked Tencent for a comment but I haven\u2019t heard back.No matter their exact use, the devices are likely still in the trial phase, as they are often shown alongside a note saying \u201cTrial location for WeChat palm-print scan payment\u201d or \u201cInternal testing. Please don\u2019t tell external people.\u201d In one photo posted online, a written warning states that photography of the device is prohibited.(Lol, this clearly didn\u2019t stop people from taking photos. And videos. And uploading them to the internet.)This reporting experience reaffirms an idea I\u2019ve had for a long time: It\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s happening in China from the outside, both because of the powerful censorship machine and because of the border policies that make visiting China difficult. Yet Chinese video platforms like Douyin and Kuaishou\u2014which are replacing traditional sites like Weibo to become the place where people express themselves and document their lives\u2014can provide more insight than ever. Since the content of videos is less search-friendly than texts, they are harder to sort through, but they also often pack more information into just a few seconds.Obviously, there\u2019s much more to the story of palm-print recognition than this preview. Why is the technology having a moment now, after facial recognition has thrived for years? How has the pandemic, which made face masks widespread, changed its course of development? How could the increasing awareness of data privacy help or hurt the prospect of palm-print recognition? There are many more interesting discussions to be had about the technological and ethical aspects of the technology, and I\u2019ll address them in the full story that we\u2019ll publish soon. I\u2019ll be sure to link in the next newsletter.Until then! I\u2019ll see you again next week (or maybe in person this week!).",

Globally, at least 2.2 billion people have has a sight condition that needs medical treatment, with 450 million children living with visual impairment.According to the World Health Organization, children who experienced severe visual impairment can go through delays in motor, language, emotional, social, and cognitive development with lifelong consequences. For school-age children with visual impairment, their academic performance and self-esteem are shown lower than others.Although eye examinations can be done to detect potentially treatable eye diseases, it is sometimes hard for children to stay focused amid the long and boring examination process, which makes eye diseases more difficult to be diagnosed.Innovative Solutions Help Diagnose Eye DiseasesTo deal with the challenge, a group of game producers and user experience designers at LightSpeed Studios has designed an application that uses storytelling and games to examine eye diseases in children based on the intelligent eye examination system invented by ZOC.The test starts with a 2-minute cartoon, which gives children a mission to save baby turtles. Children need to focus their eyes on the spotlight that searches for turtle eggs. The interesting storyline and interactive design make them stay concentrated and finish their examinations easier than before, while also learning about environmental protection.Children need to stare at and follow the spotlight to complete the mission.The entire process takes only three to five minutes, which is 90 percent faster than the old examination method. The algorithm in the system can generate a contrast sensitivity curve that reflects children\u2019s visual function based on the game results. Common eye diseases, such as retinopathy, glaucoma, cone-rod dystrophy, and retinoschisis, can be detected.\u201cWith medical principles as the cornerstone, algorithms enhancing efficiency, and the help of a gamified experience, we are able to improve the stability, accuracy, and efficiency of eye examinations,\u201d said professor Jinrong Li, a medical developer, from ZOC.To date, more than 800 children have experienced clinical research and testing at ZOC since the program\u2019s launch in July.A contrast sensitivity curve is generated by the examination system.More to be DoneThe project\u2019s next step is to further improve the cooperation with the Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group (PEDIG) and implement the system at hospitals and early education institutions across the country. This will bring timely diagnosis to children suffering from eye diseases, especially those living in remote areas, where there are lack of sufficient healthcare resources.The project team is also developing a new feature to involve visual stimulation and rehabilitation therapy in the system, helping patients with lazy eye (amblyopia) or crossed eyes (strabismus) to improve their visual ability.Tencent has been long devoted to supporting NGOs to fight against eye diseases. The company has been partnering with Orbis since 2020, contributing to the global effort towards providing sustainable comprehensive eye care services and eradicating trachoma.",

            "description": "NEW YORK, Nov. 1, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- ETAO International Group (\"ETAO\") announced that Aaliance Insurance Brokers Co., Ltd. (\"Aaliance Insurance\"), one of the variable interest entities with which ETAO, through its subsidiaries, has joined hands with Alibaba and Tencent to expand into the city-wide healthcare insurance market. In March 2022, Aaliance Insurance entered into an insurance collaboration agreement with Ant Insurance, a division of Alibaba's Ant Financial, pursuant to which Aaliance Insurance will sell and distribute the insurance products on Ant Insurance's online platform. In September 2022, Aaliance Insurance entered into a strategic collaboration framework agreement with Tencent WeSure, a subsidiary of Tencent, pursuant to which Aaliance Insurance and Tencent WeSure will jointly expand the insurance distribution networks in various cities in China. ETAO and Aaliance Insurance expect that the relationships with Alibaba and Tencent would carry out extensive cooperation in technology platform, promotion and operation, intelligent customer service, health management, and specialty drug supply and claims service. The collaboration will first be implemented in Zaozhuang and Tai'an in Shandong province, Anyang in Henan province, Xiamen in Fujian province, Mianyang in Sichuan province and other prefecture-level cities. These pilot projects will expand extended services related to the city-wide health insurance business. Wensheng (Wilson) Liu, Chairman and CEO of ETAO stated, \"We are thrilled about ETAO's strategic relationships with Ant Insurance and Tencent WeSure. With the support of the two Internet, E-Commerce and technology giants Alibaba and Tencent, ETAO would scale up the city-wide healthcare insurance service in China's market quickly. We hope that in turn would speed up the development and market penetration of ETAO's integrated healthcare services for Chinese customers.\"Aaliance Insurance LogoCity-wide insurance integrates basic public healthcare insurance programs with commercially-offered insurance. It is a new supplemental health insurance model jointly promoted by the Chinese government, insurance companies and third-party platforms. It is unique in that once a municipal government signs on the program, all residents of that city or town will automatically be enrolled in the program. In 2015, the City of Shenzhen first launched the \"Supplementary Medical Insurance for Major and Serious Diseases.\" Since 2020, city-wide healthcare insurance products have ushered in a period of rapid growth across the country. Due to the policy support and the increased awareness of people's health protection, the development of city-wide healthcare insurance became more important. The product has the attractive attributes of \"two lows and one high,\" that is, low insurance thresholds, low premiums, and high-insured amounts. It has great potential to stimulate, fill and leverage the huge market of inclusive supplementary health insurance. As an inclusive and customized insurance that connects basic medical care and commercial health insurance, city-wide healthcare insurance is important for building China's multi-level medical insurance system because it aims at reducing and alleviating the pressure of medical expenses for the general public and the issue of lack of basic social security.On January 27, 2022, ETAO signed a merger agreement with Mountain Crest Acquisition Corp. III (\"MCAE\"), a Delaware corporation and U.S. based special purpose acquisition company, as amended on June 7, 2022 and further on October 17, 2022.About ETAO International GroupETAO International Group (\"ETAO\"), a Cayman Islands company, aims to be the world's leading digital healthcare group providing telemedicine, hospital care, primary care, pharmacy, and health insurance covering all life stages of patients. \"ETAO\" brand means \"Best Medical Way\" with transformative medical care and unparalleled service. ETAO is a holding company incorporated in the Cayman Islands with no material operations. As a holding company with no material operations of its own, ETAO conducts substantially all of the operations through twelve variable interest entities (\"VIEs\") located in China, which have entered into a series of the VIE Agreements with certain indirect subsidiaries of ETAO. For accounting purposes, ETAO is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs' business operations through the VIE Agreements, which enable ETAO to consolidate the financial results in its consolidated financial statements under U.S. GAAP for eleven of the VIEs and for the one remaining VIE, in which ETAO does not own a majority interest, its financial statements will not be consolidated with the financial statements of ETAO. ETAO aims to provide best-in-class internet medical services, such as artificial intelligence and big data technologies, to improve health care delivery and quality in specialized clinics and hospital settings. ETAO's is in the process of building a platform that is seamlessly integrated based on its ability to combine technology and health sciences.About Aaliance InsuranceAaliance Insurance Brokers Co., Ltd.

            "description": "Tencent, the Chinese tech and gaming colossus that you'll know for owning a slice of seemingly everything in the games industry, is no longer China's most valuable company. Bloomberg reports that Tencent's stock price has hit a five-year low, and its overall market capitalisation was overtaken late last month by\u2014of all things\u2014Kweichow Moutai, a Guizhou-based firm specialising in the production of Maotai rice wine. At time of writing, Kweichow Moutai had a $235 million lead over Tencent's market cap.This would have been unthinkable just last year, when Tencent was trading at between $50 and $90 per share and was easily the most valuable company in China, but Tencent's fortunes have been brought low by the increasingly hostile domestic environment. A combination of China's tech crackdown, strict COVID policies, and generally flagging economic growth have made it hard for Tencent\u2014and plenty of other Chinese companies\u2014to do business. Tencent has wiped $650 billion off its market cap since the beginning of 2021.The downturn in its fortunes has led Tencent to pursue a strategy of downsizing, imposing a wave of firings in departments across China in an effort to make up for its losses. The frosty Chinese market even partially explains Tencent's ever-growing presence in the western games market: it's been buying up non-Chinese companies precisely because it's currently so tough to do business at home.The struggle shows no sign of letting up. Tencent got its first game approval from the Chinese government in over a year this September, and it's not like COVID is going anywhere any time soon. We can probably expect the company to continue cutting back at home and expanding abroad in the foreseeable future. Kweichow Moutai, on the other hand, stands to benefit from promised government support for \"consumer-driven\" sectors. Maybe Tencent should just pivot into liquor production.This is far from the end of the road for a company as massive as Tencent, but it is a stark illustration of how bleak things are looking for Chinese tech companies at the minute. Nevertheless, Tencent still has fingers in plenty of pies: aside from its stock woes, Tencent has most recently been in the news for penning deals with Ubisoft, trying and failing to make a Lord of the Rings MMO with Amazon, and opening up an AI-governed nightmare hotel in Hangzhou. Not bad for what is now only China's second most valuable company.",

Peking Union Medical College Hospital and Tencent AI Lab have jointly released a surgical navigation system with full intellectual property rights, consisting of a navigation tablet computer, a navigation bar, a depth-sensing camera, and other equipment, which can be mounted on a surgical head frame.The development of a domestically produced system took three years to achieve, and costs just one-tenth of an imported version, while maintaining high accuracy.\u201cIt is precise, portable and affordable. The system provides a real-time digital map of the brain that guides clinicians during complex surgery, significantly improves surgical reliability,\u201d said Renzhi Wang, professor and director of the Department of Neurosurgery and doctoral advisor of Peking Union Medical College Hospital.To date, more than 30 clinical trials have been conducted involving cerebral hemorrhage, pituitary adenoma, glioma, meningioma, craniopharyngioma and other brain-related tumors. During such operations, doctors must accurately locate lesions, while being extremely careful to avoid damage to peripheral blood vessels, nerves and other important tissues.\u201cIn the past, we relied on our experience to create a 3D image in our mind based on a patient\u2019s 2D CT or MRI images. This requires years of accumulated experience to do. Surgical navigation systems alleviate some of that pressure,\u201d said Wang.AI-powered 3D Brain MapsCentral to the success of the surgical navigation system is the use of AI and big data. Prior to surgery, the system can automatically visualize 3D MRI, CT and other scans using AI and imaging technology. A customized 3D see-through brain can be digitally generated with one button click, allowing doctors to make surgical plans and explain them to patients and their families.The 3D see-through brain image can help doctors better analyze their patients.During surgery, a depth-sensing camera that integrates deep learning and vision algorithms allows real-time navigation by matching the 3D brain with the patient\u2019s actual condition, acting like a map to guide doctors in real time.The \u201cnavigation\u201d demo during surgery.Image registration accuracy of the system can reach the sub-millimeter level. What\u2019s more, improved algorithm capabilities cut the time for image registration from 30 minutes to just a few seconds. Once the image registration is complete, doctors can validate it using a navigation bar, with safeguards in place to avoid surgery occurring if there is a mismatch.GPS System for Brain SurgeryFinally, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology harness algorithms and sensory data to navigate an unfamiliar environment such as a brain, while tracking surgical instruments within that environment in real-time. It acts like a GPS that detects traffic jams and roadblocks in advance, giving doctors X-ray vision during surgery. This helps doctors accurately observe the location of lesions and tissues or blood vessels that need to be protected from multiple angles without the installation of the head clamp.Saving More LivesNeurosurgery is an area of medicine where AI technologies drive innovation. Experts predict that ophthalmology, ear, nose and throat (ENT), and hospital emergency departments can also benefit from the development of surgical navigation systems. The system can also be used for clinical teaching to improve the capacity of local medical care services.By integrating computer vision, machine learning and deep learning with medical science, Tencent AI Lab continues to develop technologies that help doctors improve disease screening, diagnosis, and treatment, and ultimately, save more lives.",

Tech giants Alibaba and Tencent closed down more than 11% in Asia; search company Baidu was 12% lower while food delivery firm Meituan tanked more than 14%. The moves come after Xi paved the way for an unprecedented third term as leader and packed the Politburo standing committee, the core circle of power in the ruling Communist Party of China, with loyalists.That makes it unlikely that anyone would challenge any \"policy mistakes\" that Xi makes which could hamper growth of the tech sector, Xin Sun, senior lecturer in Chinese and East Asian business at King's College London, said.China's President Xi Jinping speaking at the opening session of the 20th Chinese Communist Party's Congress at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Oct. 16, 2022. Noel Celis | AFP | Getty Images\"Now that the new Politburo standing committee is packed with Xi's own picks and those in rival factions ... were all out, it becomes clear that no other political elite dares to challenge his policy mistakes or even deviate however slightly from his preferred policy agenda, which of course over the past few years has focused on favouring the state sector at the expense of the private one,\" Sun told CNBC via email. \"As a result, it is unlikely for these policies to be reversed or corrected, leading to an extremely gloomy economic outlook.\" Under Xi's leadership, China has implemented policy that has tightened regulation on the tech sector in areas from data protection to governing the way in which algorithms can be used. Meanwhile, Xi has stuck to the strict \"zero-Covid\" policy which has seen cities, including the mega financial hub of Shanghai, locked down this year, even as most of the world has opened their economies.These two policies have contributed to billions of dollars being wiped off the value of Chinese tech giants and companies including Tencent and Alibaba reporting their slowest growth in history this year. \"Tech stocks have never been the best friend of Xi and it's clear that the market thinks that purge will continue,\" Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners, told CNBC. As part of the leadership reshuffle in China, Li Qiang, party secretary of Shanghai is expected to be made premier next year. Li oversaw the lockdowns and zero-Covid approach in Shanghai this year. He has not served as vice premier marking a break with a long-standing tradition of the Communist Party. Li will succeed outgoing Premier Li Keqiang, an official seen as pro-business. Sun said the new leadership is largely party officials \"who had limited to no prior experience or credible record in economic management,\" marking another reason investors are concerned about the future. \"A rigid political regime with limited capacity to correct many of its policy mistakes, the lack of capable and experienced economic policymakers, and growing geopolitical risks, all under the leadership of a single person whose track record has proven unfriendly towards the private sector,\" Sun said, explaining the negative market sentiment toward China tech stocks.watch now",

            "description": "Taylor Swift\u2019s latest album \u201cMidnights\u201d has dropped, and it might be setting a new standard for China\u2019s digital music industry.Within a day of its release, the 13-track album, priced at 35 yuan, or $4.83, has racked up nearly 200,000 copies on Tencent\u2019s QQ Music, one of the largest music streaming platforms in China. While $4.83 doesn\u2019t seem like much \u2014 the album starts at $11.99 on the artist\u2019s own online store \u2014 it\u2019s the highest price ever set for digital albums in the market, which could indicate two things: the upstream cost of making albums has risen, or Chinese users are increasingly willing to pay for online music.China\u2019s digital music industry has taken quite a different route from the Western one. For a long time, music piracy was rampant across online and offline media, so streaming platforms like QQ came up with a variety of perks to get people to foot the bill. A lot of QQ Music\u2019s paid users are in effect signed up for bundle deals that give them access to other Tencent-affiliated products, such as video streaming, manga, or membership to Tencent-backed JD.com\u2019s online mall. Subscribers get all sorts of value-added services within QQ Music\u2019s platform as well, such as hi-fi streaming, access to online concerts, and customized app layouts.It\u2019s hard to say whether the $4.83 pricing is the new pricing norm or simply a reflection of the fandom for Swift in China. After all, the American artist is one of the few foreign celebrities who reach 10 million followers on Weibo, China\u2019s answer to Twitter. So far only Jay Chou, the mandopop (Mandarin pop music) king whose songs are known to everyone from my generation, has matched Swift\u2019s pricing power at 30 yuan per album copy.In the wake of Beijing\u2019s crackdown on internet monopolies, Tencent\u2019s bargaining power on licensing deals might have weakened. For years, Tencent Music Entertainment, the firm\u2019s music arm, bled money on securing exclusive rights from UMG, Warner Music, and Sony Music Entertainment. That\u2019s no longer the case. Swift\u2019s latest digital release is also available through QQ Music\u2019s archrival NetEase Cloud Music, for instance.The good news is an increasing number of users are paying for Tencent\u2019s music offerings, though the penetration rate remains modest. In Q2, TME reported 82.7 million subscribers across its three music streaming apps, up 25% year over year; a total of 593 million people use these services every month, meaning only 14% of them are paying. In comparison, 188 million, or 43%, of Spotify\u2019s 433 million users were premium subscribers in Q2.Spotify also has a more profitable product. Looking strictly at their music services (TME is a more profitable business overall thanks to its more lucrative live streaming platform that lives off virtual gift sales), Spotify\u2019s premium average revenue per user (premium ARPU) from Q2 was \u20ac4.54 ($4.48). TME\u2019s average revenue per paying user (ARPPU) was 8.5 yuan or $1.17.",

            "description": "Global stock markets have experienced major declines so far in 2022. That\u2019s mainly been due to decades-high inflation and rising interest rates from the US Federal Reserve.While most headlines focus on US stock markets, the world\u2019s second-largest economy is China. And China\u2019s stock markets also attract a lot of investors\u2019 money in Asia.One of the best places to invest \u2013 if you want exposure to the Chinese market \u2013 is Hong Kong. As of the end of 2021, companies listed there had a combined total market cap of US$5.4 trillion.That made the Hong Kong Stock Exchange the fourth-largest in Asia and the seventh-largest market in the world.Within Hong Kong, the key benchmark index \u2013 similar to Singapore\u2019s Straits Times Index (STI) \u2013 is the Hang Seng Index. It\u2019s been a tough year so far, with the index currently at 16,211 as of 21 October 2022, down 30.3% since the start of the year.So, how have the top five stocks in Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index (by market weighting) performed so far in 2022? Let\u2019s find out.Read Also: Dogs Of Hang Seng: Investing In The Top 10 Dividend Yielding Constituent StocksHSBC \u2013 Down 11.3%HSBC Holdings plc (SEHK: 5) is a London-headquartered bank that is also the dominant financial services provider in Hong Kong.It\u2019s also the stock with the biggest weighting in the Hang Seng Index (making up 9.8% of the benchmark). The bank has outperformed the Hang Seng Index so far this year. As of 21 October 2022, its share price is 41.55 HKD, down about 11.3% for the year.One of the biggest reasons for that has been its positive exposure to rising interest rates in the US. In the first half of 2022 the bank reported net interest income (NII) of US$14.5 billion, which was up more than 10% from the year-ago period.The management team at the bank also said that it intends to reinstate HSBC\u2019s quarterly dividend (which it paid pre-Covid) next year.Meanwhile, the bank has also seen calls from its largest shareholder \u2013 Ping An Insurance Group Co of China \u2013 to break itself up into separate European/Global and Asian entities.That has been a popular proposal among many shareholders in Hong Kong, who feel that the value of HSBC\u2019s shares is weighed down by its ex-Asia operations \u2013 which are much less profitable.Tencent Holdings \u2013 Down 48.7%Most people will have heard of Tencent Holdings Ltd (SEHK: 700), the world\u2019s largest gaming company and WeChat operator.The company is the second-biggest stock component of the Hang Seng Index (with a 7.63% weighting).Its WeChat social media phenomenon has morphed into an all-in-one \u201csuperapp\u201d for Chinese residents over the past decade or so.While the company\u2019s share price enjoyed a strong run from 2008 up to 2020, in the past 18 months the Chinese technology sector has come under pressure from Chinese government scrutiny.That has seen Tencent get caught in the crosshairs. As well as a government ban on new games, Tencent recorded its first-ever quarterly decline in revenue in its latest Q2 2022 earnings. It\u2019s currently trading at 232.80 HKD, down 48.7% since the start of the year.Read Also: Understanding Tencent (HKG: 0700) \u2013 The All-In-One Chinese Technology StockAIA Group \u2013 Down 16.5%AIA Group Ltd (SEHK: 1299) is a pan-Asian life and health insurance giant. The company is the third-largest component of the Hang Seng Index (with a 7.55% weighting).It traces its roots to operating in Shanghai as far back as 1919. In more recent years, though, it used to be owned by American insurance giant AIG.However, AIG spun off AIA as a separately-listed entity in a Hong Kong IPO in October 2010.So far this year, AIA\u2019s share price has fallen mainly due to its business\u2019s exposure to China and its Covid-Zero policy.As Mainland China (along with Hong Kong) made up over 50% of AIA\u2019s Value of New Business (VNB) in the first half of 2022 \u2013 a measure of growth for life insurers \u2013 the continued closure of the world\u2019s second-largest economy has hurt AIA\u2019s business.However, given its diverse business geographically (it has operations in 18 Asian countries), AIA\u2019s share price has managed to outperform the Hang Seng Index. Its share price is currently trading at 65.95 HKD, down about 16.5% since the start of the year.Meituan \u2013 Down 36.6%Meituan (SEHK: 3690) is an online platform for online dining and retail as well as other services like travel.The company, which is a key competitor to Ele.me in the Chinese online food delivery space, makes up 7.38% of the Hang Seng Index.The Beijing-headquartered company has been in a similar position to many other tech companies in China this year in that its share price has been adversely impacted by negative sentiment. Late in 2021, Meituan was fined RMB 3.44 billion (US$533 million at the time) by Chinese anti-competition authorities for monopolist practices.However, its H1 2022 earnings saw solid revenue growth and an improvement in its operating loss. Meituan\u2019s expansion into new, large markets, such as online groceries, has also created new potential revenue streams. Its share price is currently trading at 141.60 HKD, down about 36.6% since the start of the year.Alibaba \u2013 Down 39.4%Finally, we have Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (SEHK: 9988), which is the owner of e-commerce platforms Taobao, Tmall, and Lazada, among others.It also has a sizeable cloud computing arm. The company has a 7.3% weighting in the Hang Seng Index.Similar to Tencent and Meituan, Alibaba\u2019s share price has continued to suffer in 2022 on account of the Chinese government\u2019s crackdown on technology companies. It\u2019s currently trading at 69.90 HKD, down about 39.4% for the year.In terms of its business, like Tencent, Alibaba saw a severe growth slowdown as its second-quarter 2022 results saw the group\u2019s revenue come in broadly flat year-on-year.E-commerce competition from the likes of Pinduoduo and JD.com has also hurt Alibaba\u2019s business. Meanwhile, its large cloud computing business has seen its rate of growth decelerated in the past few quarters.Tech & Financials CompaniesAs investors can see, the top five components of the Hang Seng Index are dominated by companies in the financial and technology sectors.It makes sense that financial companies have outperformed the broad Hang Seng Index \u2013 given rising interest rates and diversification \u2013 while the big technology component stocks have underperformed on account of their domestic-focused businesses.Advertiser MessageLooking to gain exposure to the Hong Kong Stocks here on SGX?You can do so via Daily Leverage Certificates (DLCs) that allows you to gain leveraged exposure of up 7x on key Hang Seng Indices and 5x on Hong Kong Stocks for both Long and Short direction.

As digital residents in the metaverse space, they can do online shopping, play lotteries and games, and take photos with virtual celebrity avatars.During this year\u2019s Coca-Cola Fan Festival, users can obtain points by buying coke offline and scanning QR codes. Every user has their own digital avatar and will win more points by interacting with others.This metaverse zone built by TMELAND for Coca-Cola\u2019s Fan Festival shows many advantages of the new marketing based on virtual communities. First of all, it breaks the time and space boundary of traditional marketing, as fans can log in through the WeChat mini program, then visit the virtual spaces of various brand anytime and anywhere. Secondly, immersive digitalization allows fans to linger in virtual blocks for a longer period of time. Third, the extension of marketing scenarios can make sub-products gain more commercial value.Technically, Tencent Music Entertainment has strong development ability, and Tencent \u2018s QQ and WeChat have a large number of users. According to TMELAND\u2019s plan, different levels of solutions such as basic templates and customization will be provided for customers to choose from in the future, which is convenient for brands to choose template rooms for some basic renovation under budget considerations.In May, Adidas Originals cooperated with TMELAND to hold a metaverse music festival.

            "description": "What would it say about US innovation and President Joe Biden\u2019s stewardship of the economy if America\u2019s largest beer company, Anheuser-Busch InBev, had a bigger market capitalisation than Apple? Nothing good, probably, and indeed the very thought is a ridiculous one. Apple\u2019s $2.2tn market cap is almost 28 times larger than AB InBev\u2019s $80bn.But that is exactly what happened recently in China, where Xi Jinping is about to embark on a third term as Communist party leader, military commander-in-chief and state president. Late last month China\u2019s most famous liquor maker, Kweichow Moutai, overtook Tencent as the country\u2019s most valuable company.How can this be? Tencent is one of the most innovative and successful technology companies in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. It developed the country\u2019s most popular instant messaging and social media app, WeChat, and its WePay online payments platform is second only to Alibaba\u2019s Alipay. Kweichow Moutai, which brews a strong-smelling, 76 to 106-proof grain liquor, sells hangovers.Politics is how, or at least Chinese Communist party politics as transformed by Xi over the past decade. Xi\u2019s third term will officially begin on Sunday, October 23, almost two years from the day on which an impolitic speech by Alibaba\u2019s founder, Jack Ma, triggered Beijing\u2019s ongoing regulatory crackdown on the technology sector.Speaking on October 24, 2020, Jack Ma castigated China\u2019s state-owned banking sector for its conservatism and sloth at a financial forum in Shanghai. Ma was correct in his criticism of the banking sector\u2019s traditional neglect of the small and medium-sized enterprises.\u201cJack always understood that in markets dominated by large corporations and state-owned enterprises, technology could be the great equaliser for SMEs,\u201d Brian Wong, a former senior Alibaba executive, writes in a forthcoming book on the company. \u201cHis real mission was spreading opportunity beyond traditional elite circles . . . [by] developing a platform for neglected entrepreneurs to thrive, compete and spread prosperity on a far more equitable basis than China had experienced before.\u201dUnfortunately for his shareholders, Ma was not preaching to the converted. Other forum VIPs included vice-president Wang Qishan, the architect of Xi\u2019s anti-corruption campaign and a former state bank boss, as well as a number of senior financial regulators. Ma appeared to forget that Xi and Wang do not appreciate lesser mortals speaking truth to power. Within a fortnight the initial public offering of Ma\u2019s online finance group, Ant, was cancelled by Chinese regulators.Ant\u2019s $37bn IPO would have been the world\u2019s largest. Since the speech, the price of Alibaba\u2019s Hong Kong-traded shares has fallen more than 75 per cent. While Tencent\u2019s HK$2.37tn ($301bn) market cap is at least neck-and-neck with Kweichow Moutai\u2019s HK$2.38tn, Alibaba\u2019s \u2014 HK$1.56tn \u2014 is nowhere close.In his book, Wong documents his former boss\u2019s passion \u2014 and talent \u2014 for disruption. Revealing anecdotes include the time in 2011 that Alibaba broke China\u2019s postal system. He writes that, on its famous November 11 or \u201cSingles\u2019 Day\u201d sales festival that year, \u201cit took [China Post] months to finish delivering all the packages ordered that day\u201d.When the same thing happened a year later, Ma decided he would have to develop an in-house delivery arm. The result was Cainiao, which means \u201crookie\u201d in Chinese, and a revolution in China\u2019s logistics industry.A factory in coastal Guangdong province, Wong writes, can now ship a mobile phone to a customer 1,500 miles inland in three days for just Rmb15 ($2.08). He adds that \u201ca similar package shipped using the UPS three-day service from Boston to Reno, covering roughly the same distance, will cost more than 10 times that amount\u201d.On October 16, Xi told the party congress that \u201cwe will encourage entrepreneurship, move faster to help Chinese companies become world-class outfits and support the development of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises\u201d.\u201cBeen there, was doing just that\u201d Tencent and Alibaba executives might reply. As for Kweichow Moutai, it too might soon discover that its fortunes ultimately hinge on one man\u2019s whims. Since overtaking Tencent as China\u2019s most valuable company, the price of its Shanghai-traded shares has fallen around 8 per cent \u2014 partly on rumours that Xi might ban alcohol at party and government functions.tom.mitchell@ft.com",

You can opt-out at any time.AdvertisementTencent's nearly six-year reign as China's most valued company may be over.Once worth nearly $1 trillion, the gaming and internet giant now hovers at less than half of its peak market value. On September 30, Tencent lost its status as China's most valuable company when its market capitalization dipped below that of Guizhou-based distiller Kweichow Moutai.That means its value fell from $950 billion in January 2021 to around $325 billion in less than 22 months, per Bloomberg.As of Tuesday afternoon, Tencent has regained a narrow lead over Kweichow Moutai, with a market capitalization of $302.5 billion to Kweichow Moutai's $300.1 billion, per Bloomberg's data.AdvertisementKweichow Moutai is a household name in China. Its iconic Moutai Baijiu is a fiery 53% alcohol liquor that's commonly consumed during business dinners. The drink was famously served to Richard Nixon on his historic 1972 trip to China.The distiller's profits surged 19.1% in the last nine months, which analysis group Yicai Global attributed to an uptick in sales at the distiller's brick-and-mortar stores and the success of its new online retail platform, iMoutai.Tencent did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.Harsh restrictions on tech giants spelled the end of Tencent's glory daysMoutai liquor is placed in a liquor store in Moutai town in Guizhou province. Costfoto/Future Publishing via Getty ImagesThat Kweichou Moutai's market value could even be compared to Tencent's shows how far the tech behemoth has fallen.AdvertisementTencent's star status was thought to have been cemented during the mid-2010s when its powerhouse app, WeChat, became the super app for every online service imaginable \u2014 from texting and video calls to gaming, restaurant bookings, ride-hailing, food delivery, and paying bills.WeChat's built-in payment platform, WePay, is rivaled only by Alibaba's Alipay in a country where cashless payment is so ubiquitous that even beggars in Beijing use it to ask for change by displaying QR codes on makeshift signs.Tencent's rapid descent came less than a year after it posted a $950 billion market capitalization in January 2021, when its value was growing nearly twice as fast as Tesla's, according to Bloomberg. At the time, another tech juggernaut, Alibaba, saw its fortunes fouled and its historic IPO plans ruined when China accused it of violating its restrictions on forming monopolies.Beijing's regulatory measures came for Tencent, too, in 2021, when the Chinese government introduced new rules on antitrust between internet companies and clamped down on video gaming for Chinese minors.AdvertisementIn November, Tencent was told it would have to receive approval from regulators before publishing any new apps or sending updates to devices.This drive to curb the Chinese tech industry's previously unbridled growth comes directly from President Xi Jinping, who has regularly promoted \"common prosperity,\" or the idea of redistributing China's wealth among the nation. In August, Xi lauded his government's efforts to halt \"barbarous growth\" and \"irrational expansion\" from the tech sector.The Chinese leader has also shown no indication that he's changed his stance. Xi exhorted the need for a \"common prosperity\" during his speech at this week's Communist Party Congress, which opened on Sunday.Xi is expected to secure a third term and consolidate his position as China's paramount leader at the landmark meeting.",

            "description": "In the spring of 2021, a marauding herd of wild Asian elephants in China\u2019s Yunnan province became internet sensations, capturing the attention of the public and media worldwide. They trampled through farms, villages and towns on an extraordinary 500-kilometer trek that caused plenty of damage along the way.Conservationists have been working with local communities to address the issue by providing reliable food sources for the elephants through a project launched by the Tropical Rainforest Protection Foundation (TRPF).The program, one of the projects supported by funds raised through Tencent Foundation\u2019s 99 Giving Day charity campaign this year, is designed to manage the results of human-animal conflict. On top of that, it aims to ensure benefits for villagers through mixed use of land that maximizes the productivity of the soil.A baby elephant in Yunnan Province, China.Habitat Loss Disrupts Animal BehaviorDebate ensued about the cause of the migration. Some said it was an animal error by the leader of the herd, though most believe that it was the result of environmental degradation. Either way, the issue shone light on the plight of the elephants, as well as the potential for human-wildlife conflict if we don\u2019t learn to coexist with nature.Yunnan province is home to almost all of China\u2019s wild elephants. Many of them live in the country\u2019s only tropical rainforest, within nature reserves in Xishuangbanna prefecture, near the border with Myanmar and Laos. The establishment of protected areas, along with a hunting ban, has helped their population nearly double to about 300 since the 1990s.Nowadays, the main problem facing elephants is not illegal poaching, but the destruction of their habitat and food sources because of farming and agriculture. Intensive and unsustainable practices have compounded the issue, making land less fertile.Dramatic Measures Lead to Vicious CycleEncounters between villagers and elephants are increasingly common and steps have been taken to reduce conflict by establishing early-warning systems, erecting electric fences, and paying compensation for crop and property damage and losses.The measures don\u2019t always prevent elephants from emerging from the reserves to eat the mature crops, however, leading some villagers to abandon traditional crops such as corn, and replace them with rubber and tea, which elephants dislike. This turns into a downward spiral in which elephants have less food to eat, causing them to roam further.Sustainable SolutionsOver the past five years, the TRPF has created nearly 1,500 acres of canteens that feed maize and canes to the elephants in surrounding areas. The foundation expects more infrastructure in the future to satisfy the voracious appetites of the elephants.The next phase of the project will see the creation of food banks by partially restoring traditional rotation farming methods and encouraging a return to coexistence as happened in the distant past.A Ranger feeds a baby elephant in an elephant canteen.Utilizing Traditional Farming MethodsBy restoring traditional farming methods that help regenerate the land, and building elephant canteens that offer animals a variety of nutritious food, we help turn villagers from victims of wildlife protection to beneficiaries with an invested interest in the project\u2019s success.Agricultural land on the edge of the reserves has been set aside to cultivate nutrient-rich plants suitable for elephants. Plots are reserved for this purpose for several years before being returned to normal agricultural use, like growing bananas and sugar cane.More than 300 additional acres have been found for elephant canteens in the current phase. Villagers are paid RMB800 (US$110) for each acre of land given over to the project utilized for elephant canteens. It\u2019s a good start but we need to continue investing. To date, more than 5,300 people have donated funds, which will be mainly used for subsidies and purchasing crop seeds.It\u2019s an important step in restoring balance and harmony between humans and the nature again.",

            "description": "I know this is going to be a long week for all of you China watchers. New stories seem to be coming out every minute about the 20th Party Congress that started on Sunday. It\u2019s probably why news of the banner protest in Beijing, which happened only five days ago, already feels antiquated at this point.Over the weekend, I wrote about the digital aftermath of that protest: People\u2014some who shared photos of the protest, others who didn\u2019t know what they did wrong\u2014found their accounts banned from WeChat. They were desperate\u2014publicly begging Tencent, which owns the super app, to restore their accounts and apologizing for talking about the protest at all. If you want to know more about these \u201cconfession letters\u201d and hear from users who got banned from WeChat, you can read my story here.While I was writing it, though, I realized that one idea I take for granted might not be so intuitive for people outside China. Is a WeChat account really that valuable? Why is it so devastating when you can\u2019t use one app?The short answer: In China, your WeChat account forms almost the entirety of your social and digital lives.One reason is that there simply aren\u2019t many alternatives. Messenger, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal are all blocked. SMS messages are inundated with spam and service notifications. iMessages reach a small crowd, because only about 20% of smartphones in China are iPhones (compared with over 50% in the US). And email is basically nonexistent among the general population. No matter whether you are talking to a family member, a schoolmate, or a colleague, WeChat is the only way to go.While it started out dominating one-on-one messaging and group chats, over time WeChat incorporated all the services you would want from the internet: digital payment, shopping, streaming, networking, ride-hailing \u2026 you name it, it\u2019s probably there. In 2017, WeChat even launched in-app \u201cmini programs,\u201d which basically allow you to access non-Tencent services\u2014like Airbnb, Weibo, and office tools\u2014without ever leaving the platform. It\u2019s a whole operating system within an app. Sounds quite convenient, no? But it means you are never leaving the app, period.So losing a WeChat account means losing all of the above. As I wrote, it\u2019s not easy to get your WeChat account back; it\u2019s actually easier to regain access to these other services individually. But even then, you\u2019re stuck rebuilding the social network you may have created over a decade on the app. \u201cWhen I was adding contacts back, I was questioned if I was a scammer,\u201d one banned user told me. Fixing these connections is arguably the hardest part.",

            "description": "Tencent Holdings Ltd.'s appetite for international gaming acquisitions has increased in recent years amid tightening industry regulations in China.Gaming revenue accounts for more than half of Tencent's overall business. With domestic gaming revenue growth increasingly stymied by regulatory limits on gaming by minors and slow title approvals, the company has looked abroad to fuel its inorganic growth.Europe eclipsed Asia-Pacific as the top geography for Tencent's gaming M&A targets during each of the past four years, according to data compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence. In particular, Tencent bought stakes in European game studios based in Sweden, Finland, France, Germany, the U.K. and the Czech Republic.Tencent declined to comment on the number of gaming deals and their geographical split.* See Tencent's detailed M&A history on S&P Capital IQ Pro.* Use our Transactions Statistics page to run a custom screen of M&A by industry or geography .While Tencent's domestic gaming revenue is about three times as large as its international gaming revenue, the company has struggled with growth in recent quarters. Tencent posted two consecutive quarters of year-over-year declines for its domestic business in 2022, which the company attributed to fewer game releases, lower user spending and new regulations.Protection measures introduced by Chinese regulators in 2021 capped the time children under 18 years can spend playing games at three hours a week and limited the times of day gaming is allowed. Regulators also froze the approval of new games between July 2021 and April 2022, which led to delays in releases.Tencent's international gaming business also saw a revenue decline in the second quarter of 2022, which the company attributed to the international gaming market's \"post-pandemic digestion period.\" At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns, many people turned to gaming for entertainment at home, resulting in a sharp increase in gaming revenue for companies like Tencent and local rival NetEase Inc. That is weighing on year-over-year comparisons as revenue normalizes.Tencent's latest European M&A play was a deal to raise the company's stake in French video game developer, Ubisoft Entertainment SA, by buying out its privately held holding company, Guillemot Brothers SA. Tencent President Martin Lau said the company plans to bring some of Ubisoft's best-known games to mobile. Ubisoft is known for major gaming franchises such as \"Assassin\u2019s Creed\" and \"Rainbow Six.\"Notably, most of Tecent's largest deals since 2019 involved companies based in Asia-Pacific. Seven of its top 10 deals by gross transaction value involved Asia-Pacific-based targets. Two involved targets based in Europe.The company's largest deal in recent years was a $1.43 billion purchase of Hong Kong-listed video game company Leyou Technologies Holdings Ltd. in 2020. Its second-largest deal was the $1.13 billion acquisition of British game studio Sumo Group PLC in 2021.",

These letters were sent to weaken Moonton\u2019s grasp in the country, legal documents revealed.Credit: ONE EsportsThis prompted the counterclaim, with the court document highlighting that the case was only about Xu\u2019s non-compete and non-disclosure agreement. No decision was made on whether he used the company\u2019s trade secrets to develop Mobile Legends.Both companies are currently involved in a copyright legal battle.

            "description": "Global sea levels have increased by around 10 centimeters since 1993 due to the rapid melting of ice sheets and glaciers, threatening people and the urban ecology as they are exposed to more frequent extreme weather, rain and flood disasters.In order to cope with the challenges brought by environmental changes and floods, the concept of \u201csponge city\u201d, where the city mimics a more elastic and resilient \u201csponge,\u201d emerged.A sponge city is a new generation of nature-based urban rainwater management solution that aims to increase a city\u2019s resilience to flooding by taking an ecological approach to drainage.Mimicking the natural water cycle, the idea is to turn a city into a sponge, allowing it to capture water via green infrastructures, such as green roofs and permeable pavement, so that the collected water can be used for recycling or storage.Bringing Sponge City to Life in ShenzhenTencent in 2017 brought the model to life in its hometown Shenzhen. From conception to execution, the headquarter office Tencent Binhai Mansion incorporated a smart water management system throughout.Underpinned by Tencent Cloud Weiling, a smart building management platform, the system connects all green infrastructures around the towers using sensors, which evaluate real-time data to control the storage and release of rainwater.For example, the roofs and the green roof rain gardens collect and store rainwater. The pavements around the towers, made with ceramsite permeable materials, then absorb water and slowly release surface rainwater into underground pipes. These pipes recycle and reuse the water collected.The pavements around Tencent Binhai Mansion absorb water and release surface rainwater into underground pipes.The Futian Mangrove Reserve in Shenzhen covers an area of 38 hectares, which can also be seen as a large sponge. It leverages Tencent Cloud\u2019s technology and water management facilities to collect rains along a planned path into a freshwater lake located at the reserve, replenishing up to 400,000 cubic meters of water yearly to support the wetland ecosystem.Tencent\u2019s Technology as a Scalable SolutionBuilding on the positive momentum of the internal project, the teams at Tencent Cloud deepened collaborating with city officials to tackle the complexity of implementing the sponge city concept in Shenzhen.Powered by cloud computing, the teams leveraged various databases, from meteorology to hydrology, to build the interconnected Shenzhen Smart Sponge City Management System.The system provides a clear overview of the water system in Shenzhen to city operators, allowing them to aggregate all data to make informed predictions and evaluation of major sponge city projects. It enables them to monitor water quality and decide where to add drainage points to deal with urban waterlogging.As accessible data grows in volume and diversity, Tencent Cloud AI can also be applied to the system to continuously optimize the big data analysis module, so that it can make more accurate and effective predictions and evaluation, according to Jervise Yu, team lead for Tencent Cloud's smart water management project.Tencent Cloud technologies can be applied to the sponge city system.So far, the system has covered 11 districts in Shenzhen, providing intelligent evaluation and analysis reports for sponge city construction in Shenzhen and assisting city managers in scientific management and control.The team has assessed the applicability of the smart water management system in nearly 4,000 pieces of infrastructure including in parks, pavements, and residential districts across Shenzhen. The system has also been deployed to monitor catchment water quality at the Xinzhou River and Shangfen River.Preserving and Restoring BiodiversityIn addition, the smart water management system has supported wildlife restoration in Shenzhen.In 2020, an image of a Eurasian otter was unexpectedly captured by thermal imaging cameras at a park. This species was a top predator of the freshwater ecosystem and had not been seen in the area for a decade.A Eurasian otter was captured by a thermal imaging camera in Shenzhen.With evidence that they are inhabiting the park, it was an encouraging sign that wildlife and humans are able to co-exist in a sustainable ecosystem with smart urban planning.The successful case of Shenzhen\u2019s sponge city project showcases how a city can be re-engineered to integrate technology and sustainability into urban city development. More importantly, the data collected can be generalized for city planners to evaluate whether the smart water management system in Shenzhen can be replicated in other cities.",

However, the latest word is that the software giant has ultimately passed on buying the company. Black Shark is now apparently obliged to let as many as half of its employees go, and to abandon plans for a foray into virtual reality (VR) tech on top of that.4 ReviewsBlack Shark had reportedly been building a team that might have brought the brand's often distinctive, gaming-focused design and penchant for top-end mobile specs to the VR gaming hardware arena in the near future. However, the prospect of any resulting possible oneday headsets is now apparently off the table, as the Xiaomi subsidiary is not going to a new owner after all.\"Numerous independent sources\" now assure China Star Market that Tencent has decided to walk away from talks to buy Black Shark, in a deal that might have been worth ~US$420 million to Xiaomi.As a result, the Android smartphone brand has had to let up to 50% of its employees go. The involuntary downsizing has apparently hit all departments within Black Shark, although its new VR arm is apparently hardest hit: most of its permanent staff has apparently been let go, while all of its provisional or probationary roles have been cut.Meanwhile, Black Shark's more established line of mobile gaming flagships have bucked the trend in late 2022 as it has yet to produce intermediate upgrades powered by the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 SoC. That move (or lack thereof) might be influenced by the reported failure to become a Tencent company, although it may yet be too early to say so for sure.Buy a Black Shark 5 on Amazon",

            "description": "Amid a surging tide of car manufacturing across China\u2019s internet technology industry, Tencent \u2018s layout in the field has always been regarded as light, far less than that of leading industry players such as Baidu , Huawei, and Xiaomi . However, at the beginning of September this year, Cham Zhong, the vice president of Tencent , said at a conference that \u201cTencent Intelligent Mobility has built a rich auto service ecology with more than 40 car companies such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi, with more than 150 models. The company helps more than 100 car companies and travel technology companies with cloud services.\u201d According to Chinese media outlet Cyber Car, this shows that Tencent \u2018s auto business is actually progressing quite well.SEE ALSO: Revealing Tencent\u2019s Investment Map in the Medical FieldAccording to public information, 2015 was the starting point for Tencent in laying out its automobile business. After that, it held a launch event closely related to the automotive field almost every year. It can be seen that in recent years, the company has been constantly adjusting its business strategy in order to better connect its capabilities with the automobile industry.In 2015, Tencent formally established a department called Tencent Auto Intelligence (TAI), positioned the digital assistant of car companies, thereby building up an auto ecosystem. In September 2016, it set up an automated driving laboratory headed by Su Kuifeng, the current general manager of Tencent \u2018s automated driving division. In 2017, the company released an \u2018AI in Cars\u2019 Strategy, and announced that it had reached strategic cooperation with GAC Motor, Changan Automobile, Geely, BYD and other car manufacturers.After several years of explorations and upgrades, in June 2022, Tencent Intelligent Mobility announced a newly upgraded \u201cVehicle-Cloud Integration\u201d strategy, which disassembled the business layout into three levels \u2013 cars, smartphones and cloud technology \u2013 helping the industry to carry out effective digital connection, establish a data-driven closed loop and improve production efficiency of all links.Tencent \u2018s external investment in the field has included car makers, online ride-hailing platforms, automotive supply chain enterprises, automobile e-commerce and aftermarket entities. The enterprises include Tesla, NIO , WM Motor and many other automobile firms. Generally speaking, Tencent prefers leading auto companies with public listing potential, and pays more attention to the pursuit of capital returns. Its investment projects have less to do with promoting the firm\u2019s own business, especially in the supply chain, which is quite disorganized.Finally, it is worth mentioning that automated driving cloud services have always been at the core of Tencent \u2018s smart mobility business. In June this year, the firm put forward its \u201cVehicle-Cloud Integration\u201d concept and launched Tencent Smart Car Cloud, which once again clarified the importance of cloud technology. Tencent Cloud has built a complete cloud services solution, which can provide laaS (infrastructure as a service) + PaaS (platform as a service) + SaaS (software as a service).Focusing on the automated driving field, Tencent Smart Car Cloud has been able to connect the whole link and life cycle of automated driving R&D, such as data collection, storage, labeling, algorithm training, simulation, evaluation, mass production data return and data operations. With years of accumulation in big data, AI and other fields, as well as a strong computing power layout, combined with localized traffic scenarios and application requirements, Tencent can be considered to be one of the most competitive players in the automotive cloud technology field.",

            "description": "A logo of Tencent is seen during the World Internet Conference (WIC) in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, China, November 23, 2020. REUTERS/Aly Song Acquire Licensing RightsHONG KONG, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Tencent is resetting its M&A strategy to put more focus on buying majority stakes mainly in overseas gaming companies, as the tech giant eyes global expansion to offset slowing growth at home in China, people with direct knowledge of the matter said.Tencent Holding Ltd (0700.HK) has for years invested in hundreds of up-and-coming businesses, mainly in the onshore market. It has typically acquired minority stakes and stayed invested as a passive financial investor.However, it is now aggressively seeking to own majority or even controlling stakes in overseas targets, notably in gaming assets in Europe, the four people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.The shift comes as the world's number one gaming firm by revenue is counting on global markets for its future growth, which requires a strong portfolio of chart-topping games, the sources aid.Tencent's new strategy indicates how China's tech titans are looking to emerge from the regulatory shadows after two years of crackdown and uncertainty that weighed on their sales at home and triggered a massive selloff in their stocks.Apart from the core gaming sector, Tencent is also looking to snap up global assets, in particular in Europe, related to the so-called metaverse, said one of the sources and another source with direct knowledge of the matter.The people declined to be identified as the information was private.Tencent told Reuters the company had been investing abroad for a long time - \"long before any new regulations\" in China. It looks for \"innovative companies with talented management teams\" and gives them room to grow independently, the company added, without elaborating.Tencent's pursuit for bigger stakes in gaming firms comes as other tech giants such as Microsoft , Sony (6758.T) and Amazon are snapping up gaming assets and related intellectual properties, said three of the sources.Tencent's chief strategy officer, James Mitchell, said on a post-earnings call in August the company would remain active in acquiring new game studios overseas.\"In terms of the game business, our strategy is ... to focus on developing our capabilities especially in the international market,\" he said. \"We will continue to be very active in terms of acquiring new game studios outside China.\"PURSUIT OF BIGGER STAKESTencent's growing focus on overseas assets and markets is in sharp contrast to its much slower dealmaking pace at home since the regulatory clampdowns intensified, and the divestment of a clutch of domestic portfolio companies.From 2015 to 2020, the owner of China's number one messaging app WeChat 150 investments at home totalling $75 billion, compared to 102 deals worth $33 billion in overseas markets, according to Refinitiv data.Tencent in August reported its first ever quarterly top-line fall, partially hurt by a lack of game approvals in China and regulations that limit playing time. Revenue from online games decreased both at home and abroad by 1%.Its Hong Kong-listed shares have sunk some 60% in the last two years.Against that backdrop, Tencent has barely made investments in China this year versus 27 deals worth $3 billion offshore, Refinitiv data show. It has been reducing its portfolio partly to placate regulators and also to book some hefty profits, sources have told Reuters.\"We believe Tencent will continue to make reasonable investments to acquire quality gaming content and talents and deepen partnerships with top-tier studios worldwide in order to step up its investments and presence in overseas markets,\" said Citi analysts in a report in early September.Tencent's pursuit of bigger stakes in its existing gaming portfolio or new targets would give the company a bigger say in such firms' businesses and also help it secure the intellectual property rights of popular games, said the four sources.Also, with Beijing strictly restricting game approvals at home and still suspending approvals for games of foreign IPs, Tencent is forced to move towards gaining control of foreign game companies and their IPs, said the four sources.Tencent in September raised its stake in Ubisoft (UBIP.PA) in a deal that made the Chinese firm the single biggest shareholder of the top French games developer, with a stake of 11% which can be further increased to as much as 17%.REGIONAL HUBThe Ubisoft deal comes just after deep-pocketed Tencent in June acquired Copenhagen-based Sybo Games, the developer of hit mobile game Subway Surfer, and in August took a 16.25% stake in Japan's \"Elden Ring\" developer FromSoftware.Last year, Tencent said it would take over British videogame developer Sumo in a $1.3 billion deal - one of its largest foreign transactions since the regulatory crackdown in late 2020.In Europe, except for its purchase of majority stake in \"Clash of Clans\" mobile game maker Supercell for $8.6 billion in 2016, Tencent has for years mostly cut minority deals including its purchase of 9% of British gaming firm Frontier Developments.Elsewhere, Tencent also seeks to increase its investment in and make deeper forays into Southeast Asia as it sees the region - home to 650 million people - as having potential to replicate the success of China's internet boom, said two of the sources.China's largest social network firm already has a regional hub for Southeast Asia in Singapore that houses its international game publishing business.Since last year, the company has repeatedly emphasized that it is aiming to have half of its gaming revenue coming from outside China, from about 25% now. In doing so, it in December launched a new publishing brand called Level Infinite in Singapore.Reporting by Julie Zhu and Josh Ye; Editing by Sumeet Chatterjee and Kim CoghillOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "description": "Chenchen Gu is an expert at Tencent, having worked for more than 18 years in the video technology field.As part of her role as a technical expert in her field, she is now hoping to share her know-how and pass her experience on to help young people succeed in technology.\u201cI am dedicated to learning more each day.\u201dQ: It's been 15 years since you joined Tencent. Have you always had the desire to have a career in technology?A: I joined Tencent after graduate school and never wavered in my career pursuits. Since then, I have focused on research and development (R&D) in video technologies for products like QQ and Tencent Video. Today, I am responsible for the R&D of video technologies for Weixin, including Weixin Video Call, Weixin Channels and Weixin Moments.I\u2019m very interested in the field and regularly spend time learning more about it to broaden my knowledge. I\u2019m dedicated to learning more each day.Q: Growing from a campus recruit to a technical expert, would you attribute your success to hard work or talent?A: I think you can only talk about talent if you work hard enough. Video technology is a field requiring knowledge and the accumulation of experience over long periods of time. You need to be patient and diligent to have real technical breakthroughs and achievements. What seems to be a gift, in many cases, is the result of long-term efforts and dedication.Q: How do you keep up with the speed of technological developments and still continue to make something that surprises the world?A: I believe the recipe for success is to be down-to-earth. Technological breakthroughs are not just a sudden burst of inspiration. They come from long-term R&D accumulation and the day-to-day hands-on use of related products.One of our breakthrough innovations, Hybrid Resolution Video Coding Technology, was inspired by our daily work. Since traditional video coding is based on a fixed resolution, we found that block artifacts and some other quality problems may easily arise in the videos that include scenes such as a sparkling lake or a stage with flashing lights.What we have developed is a new technology that can decide the optimal encoding resolution for different video content within a given bandwidth. It can make still scenes look clearer and reduce compression distortion for scenes with complex motion and texture. As far as I know, we are the first in the world to apply this technology in real-time video call services.Q: Do you feel pressure in your daily work?A: The pressure mainly comes from the massive number of users and their diverse needs. Weixin has a tremendous user base with vast differences in devices and networks. Different users also have various needs. Since our services are for massive numbers of users, the code we write may be executed tens of billions of times each day. Even if there is only a small chance of an issue, the impact can be significant. We must pay attention to reliability as we develop new technologies to improve the overall user experience.\u201cIt\u2019s all about what kind of person you want to be.\u201dQ: Do you think a person's character will have a big impact on their work?A: I don't think a person\u2019s character will determine everything about their work. Our characters can be changed over time.When I was younger, I was an introvert and easily got nervous when I talked to people I didn\u2019t know. But as I gained more experience, I needed to communicate with colleagues in different departments and sometimes cooperate with external parties to share knowledge. To be successful, I had to work around my introverted character. I did this by practicing, as well as learning from those around me. The key to success is to determine what kind of person you want to be and go for it.Q: What kind of person do you want to be?A: While I have been working for many years, I still remember that when I was first engaged in video coding research, a teacher told me, \u201cStrive to be a good person, to do things reliably and to pursue knowledge.\u201d I take this as my motto and remind myself to be upright, responsible, and curious every day.\u201cLet technology and people progress together.\u201dQ: What kind of outcomes do you expect from your team?A: For our team, the purpose of developing new technologies is never to show how good we are, but to improve users\u2019 experiences. We always focus on developing technologies that are truly beneficial to users and their needs. Our technology is constantly improving by undergoing tests and applications in different products.We hope to develop more critical and innovative key technologies, which would be the core competencies of our businesses. These technologies could also help us create the next-generation video products.Q: How do you prepare your team to develop technology for next-generation video products?A: We all grow experience while developing new technologies, which in turn empowers us to develop better technologies to create next-generation products. My goals are to set the correct direction of technical research and try to minimize the cost of trial and error in the process of exploration. It is also important to let my team members deploy their talent so that they can show their expertise.",

            "description": "Karaoke is one of the most popular group activities around the world. In its spiritual home of Japan, more than half of the population are estimated to take part in karaoke at least once a year.So, when the pandemic hit and karaoke lounges closed, some people went in search of digital solutions, including Pokekara, an app that replicates the offline experience of singing with friends anywhere, anytime via your smartphone.Flexible Cloud Solutions That Deliver High-quality Livestreaming ServicesPokekara was launched in 2019 by M&E Time Entertainment and has since quickly become the leading karaoke app in Japan.As the app\u2019s popularity grew, so did its operation and maintenance costs, and stress on its platform architecture. To cope with soaring demand, M&E Time Entertainment turned to Tencent Cloud to ensure it could continue to deliver high-quality, low-latency audio and video livestreaming services to its users.It liked that we provided cloud solutions for numerous international companies, tailored to local markets and cultural differences where relevant. With Tencent Cloud, Pokekara could expand beyond songs to offer a richer experience that includes online chat, song rooms, live broadcasts, and other scenarios. Our integrated real-time audio and video technology and other products provide a stable one-stop solution that meets the diverse needs of millions of karaoke singers.What\u2019s more, Pokekara can now access a variety of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)-based products such as compute, network, and storage resources. It delivers auto-scaling capabilities in real time to meet business surges and eliminates the need for the company to invest time and money in capital works while giving it high availability to services.Performance Improves After Switching to Tencent CloudTo deliver a seamless audio and video live broadcast experience to users, two core products are used, Tencent Real-Time Communication (TRTC) and Cloud Streaming Services (CSS). These effectively meet the low-latency, high-speed and accessibility requirements for various scenarios. With 2,800+ CDN nodes around the world, our products can readily support large-scale, interactive audio and video live broadcasts.After switching to Tencent Cloud, Pokekara compared data such as latency and found that performance had improved on all measures. The company also valued the data analysis support provided by us, something it was unable to continue doing on their own as it grew.Richer Experiences for ConsumersAt its heart, Pokekara is not just a singing app, but it\u2019s a social tool that builds engaged communities with deeper connections. Content creators can showcase their talent, while any user can have their songs rated and ranked against others. They can increase exposure by uploading their own songs, and make new friends by interacting with other people\u2019s works.Once users get to know each other, they can use the song room function to interact, sing and chat together. The app\u2019s chorus function lets friends sing simultaneously and creates a sense of belonging.Focusing on Expertise And the Things That MatterIn the highly competitive social entertainment industry, Pokekara must invest time and energy on business development and product design and experience. This created great pressure on Pokekara\u2019s technology team when it was managing its own self-built platform.Not only has Tencent Cloud\u2019s TRTC real-time audio and video and CSS cloud live broadcast products allowed the app to evolve, it has also freed up Pokekara\u2019s technical team to focus on enhancing and optimizing the app\u2019s features and respond quickly to changes in consumer behavior and demands.With ongoing support from Tencent Cloud\u2019s customer service and audio and video team, Pokekara can continue to innovate and develop new products, while growing a more deeply engaged community of users through the platform.",

And since the launch of video platform Channels in 2020, the new jobs and extra income opportunities related to creating and livestreaming videos are now hitting more than 10 million in a year.Digital Ecosystem Attracts Young and Rural Entrepreneurs and WorkersThe digital ecology has been a magnet for young people, who have created and found jobs and roles in new media, mini program e-commerce, and video creation. Nearly three-quarters of mini program practitioners are aged 35 years or below, and they make up 57.8 percent of public and 48.3 percent of video account practitioners.People in rural areas are increasingly benefiting from the digital ecology as well. For example, video accounts have become a powerful tool to promote the development of rural e-commerce, expand the rural industrial market, and help people in the traditional industry find other ways to generate more income.In addition, we are seeing young people skilled and experienced in digital technology return to their hometowns and help develop digital villages.Flexibility, Low Barriers to Entry, and Increasing Job SatisfactionWeixin's digital ecosystem has become a go-to platform for many that seek for entrepreneurial and job opportunities for several reasons. Among them are low barriers to entry, low operating costs, and the potential to earn extra income.Its inclusiveness, convenience, flexible work structure and breakdown of geographical obstacles stimulate labor creativity, and facilitate a more efficient match between supply and demand.The study also found that job satisfaction and professional recognition of digital practitioners are improving. In a survey of practitioners in the Weixin ecosystem, 47.3 percent in video accounts, 31.7 percent in public accounts, and 28.9 percent in mini programs see themselves doing it in long term.Weixin Helps SMEs Accelerate Digital Transformation and Upskills Workers Into Digital CraftsmenAs consumers move online, SMEs in retail, catering, tourism and logistics in particular have had to urgently pivot to e-commerce. Weixin\u2019s rich ecosystem makes it easier by providing numerous digital tools and continuously upgrading its capabilities for SMEs to pivot their business online and find new markets.We are also seeing a phenomenon of workers, especially in manual laborers and trades, evolving into digital craftsmen. They are equipping themselves to take on new roles learning new skills on computer, smartphone, internet and digital platforms.The study recommends that digital ecologies should be expanded given their clear potential to provide stable and fulfilling employment and income opportunities. This should be done while developing mechanisms to protect workers in the growing digital economy.",

            "description": "India, as one of the world's fastest-growing economies, grapples with the urgent need to mitigate the impacts of climate change, a pressing concern to be addressed at COP28. The country's ambitious plans to decrease GDP emissions intensity by 45 percent by 2030 from 2005 levels are intricately linked with sustaining robust economic growth. Forecasted to reach Rs 301.75 trillion ($3.69 trillion) in 2023-24, India strives to achieve a $5 trillion economy by FY2025. India\u2019s Ambition However, these aspirations necessitate substantial investments, particularly in the renewable energy sector, aligning with India's goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2070. Such a transition demands significant funding\u2014approximately $10.1 trillion between 2022 and 2060, a figure that escalates to $3.4 trillion if the net-zero targets are advanced to 2050. India's commitment to net-zero emissions could potentially boost its economy by 4.7 percent above projected baseline growth by 2036, equating to a remarkable $371 billion. The shift toward renewable energy not only enhances economic prospects but also fosters environmental sustainability, potentially reducing air pollution and creating jobs within the clean energy sector. As India progresses toward expanding its renewable energy capacity, aiming for 500 gigawatts (GW) by 2030, it stands at the forefront globally. India ranked fourth globally in renewable power capacity, boasting 163GW of installed energy, while having the world\u2019s largest renewables auction market with over 38GW of solar and wind energy projects auctioned in 2022. Besides, with over $20 billion of investments in 2022, India became the third-largest investor in the renewable energy sector globally. Despite these strides, challenges persist, limiting renewable energy's contribution to overall power generation, currently hovering around 14 percent. The Renewables Challenge Moreover, irrespective of the global downtrend in renewable costs over the past decade, the world grapples with challenges in the speed of renewable deployment, infrastructure readiness, funding levels, and the inclusivity of this transition \u2013 all falling short of the demands outlined by the 1.5\u00b0C pathway. In response to this concern, the Energy Transition Working Group, led by India during its G20 presidency, has pinpointed \u201clow-cost finance for the energy transition\u201d as one of its top six priorities. Within the G20 discussions, particular attention was given to the worldwide escalation in interest rates, significantly impacting the expenses related to capital and debt financing for renewable energy projects, notably in developing nations. This surge has heightened the costs of climate-focused bonds and bank support for sustainable initiatives. Macro-level crises, such as pandemic shocks, supply chain disruptions, and the Ukraine conflict have spiked food and energy costs, prompting global interest rate hikes to curb inflation. This impacts renewable energy progress, especially in India and the Global South. Overcoming this demands stakeholder collaboration, innovative frameworks, and private capital leveraging through blended finance. Addressing climate risks can improve access to low-cost capital. India's advocacy for this in COP28 is pivotal, vital for scaling up green technologies like hydrogen and energy storage. The Carbon Capture Route India faces a critical challenge in its renewable energy journey under its coal policy. Relying on coal for 70 percent of electricity, India sees it as crucial due to poverty alleviation and rising electricity needs. Advocating for a gradual reduction rather than an abrupt removal, India emphasises \u201cnational circumstances\u201d in COP28, balancing economic growth with environmental goals. Moving toward ultra-supercritical coal (USC) power (a more efficient technique that uses less coal for producing the same amount of energy), India aims to phase-out, decrease carbon emissions, and pursue eco-friendly alternatives. Yet, to align with net-zero targets, India should prioritise carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS) tech to further reduce its carbon footprint. However, India's pursuit of its climate goals via ultra-supercritical coal power hinges on deploying CCUS technology. CCUS can potentially capture 90 percent of the CO2 emissions and securely store it underground, making it compatible with the Paris Agreement goals. But CCS remains underutilised and financially challenging, adding extra costs and complexities to coal power facilities. However, this challenge can be addressed by leveraging its existing partnerships and platforms such as International Solar Alliance, the Mission Innovation global initiative, and the Clean Energy Ministerial in the G20. Moreover, by showcasing its own initiatives in a CCUS project in Talcher while pitching for CCUS support, India can demonstrate its leadership and commitment to climate action, while ensuring its energy security and economic growth in the COP28. Thus, India's stance at COP28 bridges economic growth with climate action, urging investments in renewables for net-zero targets. While balancing coal with a gradual reduction strategy, it can also push for CCUS tech for sustainable progress. Advocating low-cost financing, India has led to climate action, securing energy and environmental goals globally. Manish Vaid is Junior Fellow, Observer Research Foundation.

This year, in addition to the signature fundraising activities on our digital philanthropy platform, Tencent\u2019s employees banded together to organize charity events to help the disadvantaged.We spoke to a few event coordinators in Amsterdam, Hong Kong, Seoul, and Singapore, who walked us through their stories on organizing charity events during 99 Giving Day, and what motivates them to contribute.Q: What was the event your team worked on?Lydia (Amsterdam): We were working with a local foundation to help children. Our employees shared their career paths with the younger generation and helped them map out their aspirations for career development.Lydia (Hong Kong): This year, our team supports the fundraising efforts of 10 charities in Hong Kong. In addition, we invited Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) to recreate the \u201c99 Giving Day\u201d theme song entitled \u201cTogether for Good\u201d in Cantonese, arranged by the Hong Kong Enharmonica of people with and without disabilities.Sangjun (Seoul): We worked on an event to teach our colleagues how to make braille books. Braille is a system of reading and writing by touch. Every single braille book made during the event will be donated to a school for kids with visual impairment in Korea.Traven (Singapore): My team volunteered at ECON Healthcare where we got to make mooncakes as well as lanterns with the elderly for the Mid-Autumn Festival.Tencent Employees, at the Amsterdam office, join the sharing event.Q: What was your role in this project team? What motivated you to be part of it?Lydia (Hong Kong): As the Communication lead for this project, I was eager to raise awareness of this meaningful event. I have been involved since 2020 when our team first introduced 99 Giving Day to Hong Kong. I also worked with WeChat Pay HK last year for the launch of the Stamps for Food initiative, which is an innovative project to encourage users of WeChat Pay HK to donate their digital stamps generated by digital payment transactions, to people in need of food.Traven (Singapore): I was the lead to reach out to various organizations for potential volunteering opportunities and shared our objectives with them. The opportunity to lead and organize volunteering activities for my colleagues is a very rewarding experience - That\u2019s why I want to be involved again.Q: Why do you think the event is important?Lydia (Amsterdam): Young people usually are uncertain about their future careers. A lot of them are yet to find what interests them and may be unfamiliar with the options they have. We would like to help them navigate different career opportunities out there and align their strengths and skills with the industry they are interested in.Lydia (Hong Kong): \"One Flower, One Dream\" is the theme of this year\u2019s 99 Giving Day. We launched an art event called \u201cDoing Good Together with Little Safflower\u201d, with 6,000 students in Pok Leung Kuk\u2019s 25 primary schools painting \u201clittle safflower,\u201d Tencent\u2019s charity IP, to share the message of joy and hope. This project welcomed students and families in need so they, too, can partake in extracurricular activities and pursue their dreams.Sangjun (Seoul): 8th September is UNESCO International Literacy Day, and I found out that only 13.5 percent of visually impaired people can read braille books. Furthermore, only 1 percent of braille books globally are provided to vision-impaired children in Korea. That\u2019s why I\u2019m proud that the books made in the event will be part of those sent to these children.Traven (Singapore): It\u2019s a good chance for us to step back from a busy workday and a way to remember why we do the work we do. Ultimately, it\u2019s about contributing back to society, which is the essence of the tagline #TogetherForGood.Employees at Tencent Korea make braille books for vision-impaired children.Q: What does 99 Giving Day mean to you?Lydia (Amsterdam): It means that I can give back to the society and use what I have learnt.Lydia (Hong Kong): It\u2019s my third year participating in 99 Giving Day here in Hong Kong. This year we\u2019ve made greater impact through broader collaborations with more charities and reaching out to more people in Hong Kong through the shared love of music.Traven (Singapore): It\u2019s a day of contributing back, a reminder for me to put the giving spirit in my heart.Q: What are some memorable moments when planning this event?Lydia (Hong Kong): We filmed the music video on the day before a typhoon, which was very hot and humid. All of us, including the two pop singers, 10 musicians, and 10 Tencent volunteers and family members, along with mascots \u201clittle safflower\u201d and \u201cTVBuddy\u201d, had to endure several hours of harsh weather outdoors.Traven (Singapore): It was the brainstorming session with colleagues where there were so many possibilities for us that it was hard to pick from, and we wish we could\u2019ve done more!Sangjun (Seoul): Employees are surprised to learn about the current educational challenges that visually impaired children have and asked how they can support them further in other ways.Tencent HK staff volunteers with their family members join the MV shooting.Q: Use one word to describe the event, and why?Lydia (Hong Kong): Together. The project is a joint effort from various teams, many are volunteers including myself.Traven (Singapore): Joy. It\u2019s both the joy of organizing it, and also the joy received by the volunteers. I wish this joy can continue to be spread to the rest of the world too.Sangjun (Seoul): Surprise. We are surprised by how little help the visually impaired community receives from society. We hope to raise awareness of this group to everyone so that they can receive proper resources like educational support and vocation training.",

What healthcare consumers lack is an integrated online resource that brings together multiple providers with reliable information in a one-stop, easy-to-use platform.Back in 2017, Tencent began exploring ways to enhance public access to China\u2019s healthcare system while addressing this critical issue. With more than one billion users on Weixin and its international version WeChat, we began thinking how we can create a patient-centric, integrated online platform that makes it easier for people to connect with credible medical services and health information, whether they live in megacities or remote mountain villages.Solving Immediate and Urgent ProblemsWe launched several pilot programs looking at how we can apply technologies such as artificial intelligence to improve the efficiency of medical services. In 2019, we began beta testing of the Tencent Healthcare platform, a mini program within Weixin ecosystem and accessible to all Weixin and WeChat user.When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, we accelerated our efforts to create an integrated and effective internet platform to address not only the immediate and urgent problems, but also to establish the future model for the online healthcare system. We sought to integrate online solutions and boost the platform\u2019s reliability.From its earliest iteration, the Tencent Healthcare platform became the major online source for reliable health information in China. The platform became more popular during the pandemic. Both Weixin and WeChat users are using it to book consultations, arrange prescriptions and access professional healthcare information. At the peak of pandemic, the platform served over 350 million visitors in February 2020, and the platform is still a go-to for more than 95 million users a month.Mobile Digital AssistantAn integrated platform enables an online services model that creates a better patient experience and enhances the efficiency of medical professionals who perform administrative tasks. It is part of broader initiatives worldwide to digitize health records in order to provide better healthcare.A patient-centric and decentralized ecosystem of medical and healthcare specialists connected to secure electronic medical records (EMR) can be tailored to each unique health setting to ensure coordinated, faster and more accurate service.Unlike the original computerization of the healthcare system in the 1990s \u2014 when doctors had to spend more time on computers and admin chores than with patients \u2014 medical staff can now engage with patients through such a \u201cmobile digital assistant\u201d at a deeper and more meaningful level.We see more opportunities for doctors and hospitals to use telemedicine and other online technologies to deliver healthcare services to patients. More and more routine medical transactions will be conducted online, and the internet will continue to be a primary source of healthcare information.Healthcare TransformationWe are creating an extensive, independent, credible and well-researched database of resources validated by medical professionals for anyone to access. This database includes articles, papers and streaming video assets covering a wide range of illnesses and treatments.We're integrating general public health information, with the overall journey in the healthcare system, such as booking medical appointments, paying hospital bills, purchasing over-the-counter medicine and consulting with doctors via messages or livestreams. The 360 approach allows them to access a network of experienced healthcare providers and ancillary services, from prevention and early screening to treatment.For medical professionals and organizations, on the other hand, an integrated, digitalized health platform connects them to a wider ecosystem outside hospitals, creating opportunities to develop their specialties and offer better treatment to patients.Better record management facilitates better health outcomes and improves the patient experience. With patient records available in secure digital format, doctors and nurses can make more timely and informed decisions around effective disease prevention and primary care, targeted and high-quality acute care, and long-term chronic disease management.Plus, admin tasks like paperwork can be reduced by consolidating patient contact details, medical histories, insurance records and the like all digitally in one place.As Tencent Healthcare continues to evolve, we will look for ways to continuously refresh and enrich the content on our platform to bring the online and offline healthcare worlds together and create a better patient experience for everyone.",

            "description": "Started in September 2015, 99 Giving Day is an annual philanthropic campaign hosted by the Tencent Charity Foundation in collaboration with thousands of other charity organizations, enterprises, celebrities, and media companies. Since its establishment, 99 Giving Day has become a renowned charity event.This year, Tencent is continuing this initiative across Europe, Asia, and North America.In the U.S., Tencent Americas has partnered with Los Angeles-based NGO Starlight Children\u2019s Foundation to provide hospital gowns, games, and special deliveries to hospitalized children. Founded in 1982, Starlight\u2019s mission is to deliver happiness to seriously ill kids and their families. Programs are provided directly to children through Starlight's network of more than 800 children's hospitals and other community health partners throughout the world.From 99 Giving Day through to the end of the year, colleagues across all the Tencent Americas offices will participate in this year\u2019s event. The full list of activities for this year includes:1. 99 Giving Day \u2013 Auction for Good: Tencent employees donated services or skills, which were listed on the silent auction page and open for all North American employees to bid on during the fundraiser period from September 6th - 9th. The proceeds were all donated to Starlight Children\u2019s Foundation.2. Backpacks Volunteer Event: Tencent Americas also partnered with Starlight to provide school supplies for ill kids in hospitals located in California through donations from Tencent America Giving (TAG). On September 9th, Tencent employees delivered 350 Starlight backpacks filled with essential school supplies and hand-written cards for ill children. Starting in the Playa Vista and Irvine offices as a pilot program, this initiative will expand to other offices later this year.3. Installation of Gaming Units: In partnership with Starlight, Tencent will also help install three gaming stations to seriously ill children at hospitals in November. Each gaming station came pre-loaded with Nintendo video games and several streaming platforms for entertainment in the hospital environment.4. Donation of Starlight Hospital Gowns: Tencent Americas donated 1,000 hospital gowns featuring Starlight\u2019s colorful and playful icons. The \u201cSearch & Find\u201d patterned gowns feature a QR code that leads to a series of boredom-busting mini-games.Yumi Liang, an executive assistant working at the LightSpeed Studio in Irvine, participated in the activity. She said Tencent\u2019s contributions to the local community are one of the reasons she decided to join the company. \u201cProjects like this inspire me to do more good deeds on a daily basis in all areas of my life.\u201dWe spoke to Gina Liu, HR Program Specialist at Tencent Americas, who walked us through her journey as one of the core organizers of the philanthropic event at Tencent Americas, and what 99 Giving Day means to her.Q: What was your role in planning for this year\u2019s 99 Giving Day?A: My official role in HR program team in 99 Giving Day is to support the localization and execution of corporate initiatives here in North America. Besides my official role, I also joined Tencent America Giving as the Program Lead responsible for the partnership with Starlight Children\u2019s Foundation. My main task was to come up with local initiatives that echo Tencent headquarters\u2019 focus on supporting children and volunteering, while staying relevant to the operations and priorities of our North America business.Q: What motivates you to be part of the project team\uff1fA: I was very happy to be a part of this initiative as a core member of the project team. I enjoyed working with Starlight and very much identified with their mission of delivering happiness to seriously ill kids. For this year, Tencent Americas helped pack school supplies and will deliver 1,200 backpacks in total to children in hospitals. It melts my heart to see how our action brought smiles to these children\u2019s faces and it feels good to be doing something with such a positive impact.Q: How did the decision to partner with Starlight come about?A: When I joined Tencent about a year ago and first learned about the TAG (Tencent America Giving) initiatives, we were still in the process researching all the local NGOs that we could potentially work with. We assessed them based on a few criteria \u2013 whether they are locally relevant, and whether their mission is aligned with what Tencent represents. Starlight was shortlisted as part of that process and came up as a top choice for us. They were a great fit due to the relevance of their work. Specifically, one of Starlight\u2019s initiatives is to bring the healing power of play to hospitalized kids by providing easy access to their favorite video games, movies, TV shows, and even streaming content. This really resonated with what we do here at Tencent Americas, where over half of our employees work in gaming.Q: What were some of the most memorable moments when planning this event?A: The partnership with Starlight really opened my eyes to the lives of these children. It was more than just making donations to ill kids, but about understanding what it means to be children confined to staying in a hospital, and the boredom and anxiety they experience. That was something I never thought of before. One of the most memorable moments was seeing how much joy it brought the children when we delivered a specially designed gaming station, complete with wheels so that it could be moved around different rooms.Q: What does 99 Giving Day mean to you?A: I think it comes down to two layers. It is very important for a global company like Tencent to have initiatives like this as it provides a great way for a global team like us to connect with the headquarters, while celebrating our local attributes. For instance, the concept of silent auctions is quite unique to the U.S., and it was a wonderful opportunity for local employees to connect and socialize. I don\u2019t believe we have something similar in other regions.From a personal perspective, I think it is an important initiative that gives employees the opportunity to give back to the society. It was a great experience for me to get connected with the local community through the partnership with Starlight, and it gave me a real sense of the positive impact I can make on society.",

            "description": "Are you looking to showcase your brand in front of the brightest minds of the gaming industry? Consider getting a custom GamesBeat sponsorship. Learn more.Consolidation is remaking the game industry as we know it, and it is likely going to happen faster as the threat of a recession looms larger. The first half of 2022 has seen more than 651 deals announced or closed with a disclosed value of $107 billion, according to investment bank Drake Star Partners.We talked at the Gamescom event in Cologne, Germany, with Pete Smith and Eddie Chan at Tencent, which has become the world\u2019s biggest game company. Smith joined the company 15 months ago to help serve the second-party studios that Tencent has invested in. And Chan focused on making investments in companies through Tencent Games Global, which has more than 20 game studios now. Now he is spending more time helping to govern those studios.At Gamescom, Tencent showed off 10 or so games being developed under its Level Infinite brand, like Metal Hellsinger and Warhammer 40,000: Darktide. Chan said the key to making deals work is giving the acquired or invested teams creative independence. The goal is to support and empower them, Chan said.Still, Chan sees a natural pullback happening across the game industry as the slowdown takes root and growth in games slows down. It\u2019s also a time to focus on gameplay, and to be cautious about hyped categories such as metaverse and blockchain.Event GamesBeat at the Game Awards We invite you to join us in LA for GamesBeat at the Game Awards event this December 7. Reserve your spot now as space is limited!Learn MoreHere\u2019s an edited transcript of our interview.Eddie Chan and Pete Smith of Tencent.GamesBeat: Can you tell me more about yourself and your background?Pete Smith: I\u2019ve been at Tencent for about 15 months now. I was previously at PlayStation for a long time, almost 18 years, and before that at EA. I\u2019ve been in the game industry all my working life, and I love it. I\u2019ve seen a lot of changes.I joined Tencent to help manage some of what we call the second-party studios, the majority invested studios. There\u2019s a difference in the way we treat those and the small investees. Once you cross that majority threshold, then they\u2019re part of the family, but also they can get access to\u2013there\u2019s no secrets at that point. They have access to all the technology and knowledge. That\u2019s one of the many ways we want to support those developers in terms of all the knowledge that exists within the Chinese teams about games as a service and live ops. Plus just supporting the teams.Our brief is very simple. How can we help the teams make great games? Great games that are focused on maximizing their success in the west on PC and console, which is something Tencent traditionally hasn\u2019t done. I\u2019m building a team in Liverpool to manage some of the developers globally, outside of China.GamesBeat: Is onboarding newly acquired developers a big part of it?Smith: It\u2019s the whole soup to nuts. Helping those teams, the new teams\u2013there\u2019s a learning curve. But often there\u2019s a relationship prior to any acquisition. It\u2019s not as if all of a sudden the studio pops up and nobody\u2019s worked with them before. Sumo Digital is a perfect example. They have had a relationship with Tencent for a long time. That transition was much smoother as a result. And that\u2019s great, because everyone knows what the partnership is likely to look like before a more formal acquisition.That\u2019s definitely a part of it, the onboarding. And then it\u2019s just working with the team. What we don\u2019t want to happen is a situation where a studio comes into the family and nothing changes. There should be positive changes. It\u2019s all about the balance. How do we make sure we don\u2019t break anything and ruin the reason we acquired them in the first place? We can\u2019t change a studio into something that it isn\u2019t. But at the same time, with the backing of a partner like Tencent, how can we support them to maximize their potential and grow and deliver some great games? It always has to be about making great games.Level Infinite\u2019s Vampire: The Masquerade \u2014 Blood HuntGamesBeat: What are some studios that came in that way recently?Smith: The most recent addition to my team\u2013we have Tequila Works. That was one that was started a long time ago, but it was quite a long process. Just within this year we\u2019ve had Tequila Works, Inflexion \u2013 they\u2019re doing Nightingale \u2013 and Sumo. Again, that started quite early, but it\u2019s only completed this year. We\u2019ve been quite busy.GamesBeat: And Eddie, how long have you been at Tencent?Eddie Chan: About four and a half years. It\u2019s been an interesting journey.GamesBeat: It feels like a bunch of things have slowed down in the industry at large. I don\u2019t know if that affects what you\u2019re doing.Chan: I\u2019d say my role has evolved. At Tencent things are always changing. I\u2019ve learned to go with the flow a bit. Even before the market slowdown or what-have-you, I was already transitioning from doing more investments to more working with the studios we\u2019d already invested in. We\u2019ve grown from\u2013when I got here we had maybe two or three of the studios inside of Tencent Games Global. Now we\u2019re at around 20. We\u2019ve gotten to a stage where we needed more governance and a system of working with those studios. I\u2019ve naturally been evolving more to that side. The majority of my time is now spent there instead of the investing side.GamesBeat: I see some companies that are still extremely successful at making investments and acquiring companies, like Tencent and Embracer. What\u2019s the usual selling point? And how do you try to distinguish yourself? How do you attract the people who want to do deals and make them happy?Chan: I can\u2019t speak to what others do, but our approach has been pretty consistent throughout. We definitely want our studios to have creative independence. We want them to do what they\u2019re passionate about. Not having them do that seems like a waste. That\u2019s the objective, to find the best talent and allow them to make the game of their dreams. Typically we look for studios that have a track record and that we believe in in terms of their ability to do that.Tower of FantasyOur goal on the one hand is to help them from a financial standpoint, so they don\u2019t have to worry about that treadmill of constantly trying to get funding for the next project. On the other hand, we want to provide support in specific areas where we\u2019re able to. That\u2019s different for every studio. For some it might be market intelligence. Where should they focus with their next game? For some it may be technology, helping them with the back end and architecture to stand up multiplayer in their next project. For some it might be games as a service. For some it might be transitioning to mobile. We look at it and say, \u201cWe think we have some know-how. We\u2019re happy to make whatever we have available to help you find success.\u201d It\u2019s pretty straightforward.Smith: It\u2019s really about finding the value add on our part. The two words I use are support and empower. We want to support them, obviously, on the financial side. It\u2019s important to almost remove that from the conversation. It\u2019s a big thing, but it\u2019s not there. We can take that away. The more time the developer can spend thinking about the game, the better. But it\u2019s also about supporting them with technology and the whole knowledge base across not just Tencent, but the suite of studios we have as well. There\u2019s a huge amount of experience and knowledge. We really encourage collaboration.And then it\u2019s just empowering them, making sure they have everything they need so they can focus on great games. Having a big partner that has such a wide reach\u2013there are so many small things that can distract a developer. We can take all that away so they can single-mindedly focus on making the most successful game they can.GamesBeat: What does the Level Infinite brand mean or stand for at Tencent?Smith: We\u2019re trying to create something that\u2019s synonymous with quality. We\u2019re in a great position to not just say this, but deliver this. Focus on quality. Focus on making something that moves the needle, that makes a difference. That goes across all of the teams. If we can deliver games that do something different, that surprise and excite our gamers, that will become synonymous with the brand. We have to define the brand through our games, through our content. We need to build the right games, and then people will look at Level Infinite and say, \u201cRight, I know what to expect.\u201dTencent\u2019s Level Infinite brandThere is a Tencent type of game. We are looking more toward the future in terms of the games as a service side of things. We\u2019re looking for those trends that we can take advantage of and maximize. There\u2019s a certain type of game. But that will be defined over time through our content. It\u2019s easy for us to say it\u2019s going to be this and this and this, but I\u2019d rather we say, \u201cHere\u2019s what it is because you can see it in our games.\u201dChan: It\u2019s going to be a long-term journey. What Level Infinite represents right now is still being built. Ultimately the proof is in the pudding. We need to release great quality games. But the aspiration is that Level Infinite becomes synonymous with great games, great gameplay. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve always aspired to. We wanted to create a brand that, over time, represents that.As we were thinking about it, we now have a portfolio of a lot of smaller studios that we hope will be putting out great content. Can we create some sort of halo effect around all of them that helps them all benefit across the board over time? That was the intention around it. We\u2019ll see if we get there, but that\u2019s the hope.If you look at the first couple of titles coming out under the brand, with Tower Fantasy we\u2019re at about 10 million installs worldwide in a little over two weeks. Last night Metal: Hellsinger got the award for Most Anticipated PC Game here at Gamescom. Darktide is already causing a huge buzz. Media people have loved it. Those are just the first three titles coming under the Level Infinite branding.GamesBeat: How many games are you showing here this week? Is it about 10?Smith: At the booth it\u2019s eight or 10. Anyone can see the investments we\u2019ve made, if you look at the suite of studios. What you can\u2019t see is what those teams are doing. But because we\u2019re supporting those teams, that\u2019s why the future should be incredibly bright for those teams. We\u2019re now in the background talking to those teams, looking at what their vision is. Eddie mentioned that dream game. It\u2019s lovely to be in a position where we can go to developers and say, \u201cWe\u2019re a new partner. This is a new relationship. What\u2019s the goal? What can we do? How can we collaborate and work together to make the game you\u2019ve always wanted to make, but you\u2019ve been restricted for whatever reasons.\u201d We\u2019re almost starting with a clean slate. That will then pay dividends for years to come. I think you\u2019ll see the Level Infinite brand evolve over time. We have a relatively small slate of games right now, but that\u2019s only going in one direction as you start seeing the benefits of the investments we\u2019ve made.GamesBeat: Is there anything that you think needs to slow down now because the overall global environment has changed?Chan: Not really, in the sense that\u2013most of the projects, or all the projects we have underway are multi-year investments. They\u2019re already on the path. There\u2019s not a lot of change. Fundamentally I don\u2019t think anything about the game industry has changed, in the sense that\u2013there\u2019s a rising tide that\u2019s going to lift all boats. Gaming is going to continue to grow. More people are going to play games. More people are going to engage with games. The overall industry and revenue trends are only going to continue to grow.We got ahead of ourselves going through the pandemic. I think this is a natural pullback in the overall arc of an industry that\u2019s otherwise going to continue to drive more engagement. From that perspective, we\u2019re always relatively long-term in our view. Fundamentally our approach hasn\u2019t changed.Dune: AwakeningGamesBeat: Are you excited about things like the metaverse, blockchain, web3, or are they distractions from games?Chan: This is speaking for myself, but I think it\u2019s still early days. For me it comes down to the gameplay experience. There\u2019s a lot of potential in those new technologies. It could be the future. I want to see it actually improve the experience for players and make it a better, more interesting, more innovative, more engaging experience. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re quite there yet. We\u2019re watching excitedly, but still on the sidelines.Smith: For our developers, as Eddie mentioned, we want them to have creative autonomy. One of the benefits of having such a wide range of developers is we have so many different people thinking about games in different ways. If a developer wants to explore an area like the metaverse, we won\u2019t say, \u201cThat\u2019s not something we\u2019re interested in.\u201d But Eddie is absolutely right. My first question is, \u201cHow does that benefit the game?\u201d If someone comes along and says they have a blockchain game, I\u2019m probably not interested right off. If they say they have a great game that takes advantage of blockchain, then that\u2019s the right way to think about it.We\u2019re supporting our developers to be creative, to experiment, to look at the long-term plan and what the future is. Within that, the brief is very wide. The developers are all noodling away and thinking about what the future looks like with our backing, and they\u2019ll come up with some amazing ideas.GamesBeat: I was looking at the first and second quarter investment numbers for blockchain game startups. It was a third of all funding, and then half of all funding in the second quarter. Some VCs were saying that nine out of 10 pitches they were getting were blockchain game startups. I wonder if that\u2019s going to clear out now, if that level will start dropping down.Chan: I imagine it would, with the crypto winter and everything else going on. We\u2019ve certainly been seeing a lot of pitches in that area as well. But to us it starts and ends with gameplay.GamesBeat: With mobile, I don\u2019t know if the motivation for companies to sell and become part of bigger companies\u2013did that change because of things like the IDFA challenges everyone is facing? We saw Zynga comment about how they didn\u2019t know if they\u2019d be affected. Then they were affected. Soon enough, they sold. That\u2019s their cushion to deal with a market that\u2019s now less predictable. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a prevailing reason for some companies to want to become part of a bigger company.Chan: Again, I can\u2019t comment on what others are doing. But what I would say is, our games, on the mobile side\u2013first of all, at Tencent Games Global we haven\u2019t invested in that many mobile companies. We\u2019ve primarily invested in PC and console. Second, I think the games that we focus on and pride ourselves on in the mobile market have relied less on that user acquisition model. That\u2019s a difficult model to sustain. It\u2019s hard to drive ROI. We typically focus on the mid-core and hardcore games that are driven more by gameplay and word of mouth, rather than needing to allot UA to drive user growth. We\u2019re somewhat more insulated from those trends.The other thing I\u2019d say about this is, our approach in terms of investments and acquisitions is always about empowering the founders to stay. In fact, if a founder says, \u201cI\u2019m out, I\u2019m not sticking around,\u201d we\u2019re probably not interested in a deal like that. If there are motivations about exiting, that probably doesn\u2019t suit us. We\u2019re not in the business of running studios ourselves. We\u2019re in the business of empowering great game developers to continue to do what they\u2019re passionate about.GamesBeat: Does it feel like there are some regions on the rise for you as far as where you\u2019re interested in investing or acquiring? For a while Finland was the obvious place. Turkey saw a lot of deals happen more recently.Chan: Honestly, we\u2019re not driven by geography. That\u2019s not how we think about things. Of course, our team is spread out across the world to be able to find opportunities. But we don\u2019t necessarily have a thesis that says, \u201cNow we want to invest in New Zealand. Now we want to invest in Finland.\u201d We meet great folks at Supercell or GGG and we think, \u201cWe really like these guys!\u201d Our goals are aligned to what they want to do and we think we can help.

            "description": "A man listens to music as he waits for his train at Churchgate railway station in Mumbai December 5, 2012. REUTERS/Navesh Chitrakar Acquire Licensing RightsNEW DELHI, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Tencent-backed Indian music streaming app Gaana has switched to a paid subscription model to avoid closing down after failing to secure fresh funds or find a buyer, according to an email sent to some music partners seen by Reuters.Gaana, also backed by India's Times Internet, said in the email that talks with a potential acquirer had \"fallen through,\" without naming the other party.Two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters the talks were with Indian telecom giant Bharti Airtel (BRTI.NS). Airtel did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.Gaana competes with the likes of Spotify (SPOT.N), Apple Music and Airtel's Wynk music app in an Indian streaming market estimated by data firm Statista to be worth $700 million this year.In the email sent this week, Gaana's head of content and partnerships, Sachin Kamble, said the company had not been able to \"bring in fresh investments\" and sought support for a new paid model of the service.\"Now we are at (a) crossroads - wind down/find a way to continue ... we have decided to give this another try. Hence, we have closed streaming for free users today and (are) moving to paid only model,\" Kamble wrote in the email.\"We will need your support on this, else we will have to shut down completely.\"Gaana CEO Sandeep Lodha told Reuters in a text message: \"We are not shutting down\". Kamble declined to comment.Asked about the email, a Gaana spokesperson said in a statement the message was sent to music partners \"in the course of private negotiations\" to close agreements.\"These statements are being read out of context. Gaana is a strong business that is increasing its focus on subscription business with an intent to be a lasting company for years to come,\" it added.Tencent (0700.HK) and Times Internet did not immediately respond to requests for comment.As of Friday, Gaana's music app was not allowing free streaming for users, offering monthly plans starting at 99 Indian rupees ($1.24). The app has more than 100 million users.In 2020, the company was valued at more than $500 million, according to Indian tech news website Entracker.One of the sources said Gaana had struggled to raise money from investors, including China's Tencent. Since 2020, India has increased scrutiny of investments from countries with which it shares a land border - including China - to deter opportunistic takeovers during the COVID-19 pandemic.The crackdown deepened after a border clash between India and China later that year, which has since held up billions of dollars of capital inflows to the auto and technology sectors among others.Reporting by Aditya Kalra and Munsif Vengattil in New Delhi Editing by Sanjeev Miglani and Mark PotterOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "description": "Chinese tech majors Tencent and ByteDance were the top-grossing publishers in global mobile app stores for the first half of 2022, according to a report by business insight firm Sensor Tower.The global mobile app market is highly centralized, with 91% of revenue coming from the top 1% of publishers. Over the years, such centralization has been shrinking; the market share of the top 1% has hit its lowest point since 2019.Why it matters: Tencent and ByteDance have dominated the global mobile markets for years with their trending game titles and the internationally phenomenal video app TikTok. The two majors have invested heavily outside of China, launching new services and acquiring studios in recent years.Despite the highly centralized nature of this market, top players are losing shares and creating more space for newcomers.Details: By analyzing 900,000 publishers on the Apple App Store and Google Play, Sensor Tower found that the top 1% of publishers accounted for 79% of all downloads and 91% of revenue on the two platforms in the first half of 2022. The remaining 99% shared 21% of the market.Tencent was the top-grossing publisher in game and non-game categories, earning about $3.3 billion in the first half of 2022. The figure is almost 153% larger than ByteDance, which came second on the chart with $1.3 billion in revenue.Tencent was also the most profitable gaming app publisher in the same period, generating over $2.6 billion, thanks to its popular titles like Honor of Kings and PUBG Mobile\u200b\u200b. Tencent accounted for around 10% of revenue from all top game publishers.In the gaming category,106,000 publishers introduced new titles in the first half of 2022. While the top 1% of gaming publishers took over 79% of the market globally with 22 billion downloads.In non-game apps, ByteDance\u2019s TikTok remains the global app bestseller and most downloaded in the first half of 2022, helping to boost the company\u2019s revenue growth.In August, TikTok and Douyin, two short video apps owned by ByteDance, pulled in more than $306 million from the global Apple App Store and Google Play, contributing to the first-place ranking in the global mobile non-game revenue list, a figure 1.8 times that of the same period last year.Context: Revenue from mobile apps saw a 2.2% decrease semi-annually (in Chinese) in the first half of 2021, a total of $65 billion less than in the second half of 2021. It is the first fall in revenue since 2019, according to Sensor Tower.The fall was mainly due to a revenue decrease from mobile games, which hit $41.3 billion in the first six months of 2022. The US, Japan, and China are the top three markets for mobile games, with the former two seeing over 8% less revenue compared to the second half of 2021.Tencent has been ambitious this year, making major moves in the overseas gaming market. The firm announced new progress with its partner Ubisoft, which just doubled its holding shares in new mobile titles. It also invested in notable publisher and developer FromSoftware, and acquired Sybo, maker of popular game title Subway Surfers.TikTok also has great expansion plans in the overseas market, with a particular focus on e-commerce business. Since it launched TikTok e-commerce in Indonesia in February 2021, it has expanded local and cross-border business in Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore. TikTok also cooperated with e-commerce giant Shopify last August, allowing users from the US and Britain to buy goods directly through the app.",

Still, the Guillemot brothers managed to fend off a raid by French tycoon Vincent Bollore via his media group Vivendi.Smaller mobile video game maker Gameloft, formerly led by Yves Guillemot's brother Michel, was gobbled up by Vivendi six years ago.The secretive siblings, sons of agricultural traders from a small town in Brittany, western France, have vowed to protect their independence, a goal which Yves Guillemot, 62, reasserted on Thursday. \"Our first intention is to own our destiny,\" he said.",

Collectively, this group can own up to 29.9% of Ubisoft shares with voting rights.After the completion of this deal, the Guillemot family concert would own 24.9% of voting shares.The deal only gives Tencent 5% of voting rights in GBL, but no seat on the board of directors or consent or veto rights in the operation of the business.However, in connection with the deal, Ubisoft's board of directors has given Tencent permission to increase its directly owned stake in Ubisoft from 4.5% to just under 10%.

            "description": "Tencent has increased its stake in French games maker Ubisoft, the company behind popular franchises like Assassin's Creed. But analysts said this has effectively closed the door on a full takeover of the company.Shares of games developer Ubisoft plunged more than 17% on Wednesday after prospects of a full takeover were dampened following a move by Chinese tech giant Tencent to increase its stake in the company.On Tuesday, the two companies announced that Tencent invested 300 million euros ($296.9 million) in Guillemot Brothers Limited, amounting to a 49.9% stake in the company. Tencent only gets 5% voting rights in the company.Guillemot Brothers Limited is controlled by the Guillemot family, and is the entity that controls the majority of the family's roughly 15% stake in Ubisoft.The Guillemot brothers founded Ubisoft in 1986 and have fought hard to keep the company independent and protected from a takeover.Tencent's investment values Ubisoft shares at 80 euros each, an 83% premium on Tuesday's closing price and gives it an indirect stake in the French games developer.The move effectively closes the door on a full takeover of Ubisoft by any party, according to analysts, something that investors were holding out for.\"What this transaction does appear to signal is that any full sale of Ubisoft to a strategic or financial buyer is very unlikely. In our view this should be seen as a net negative for shares (though not for the company itself),\" analysts at Cowen said in a note Tuesday.As part of the deal, Tencent is able to increase its direct stake in Ubisoft from 4.5% currently to 9.99% of the capital or voting rights. But Tencent will not be able to sell its shares for five years and will not be able to increase its stake in Ubisoft beyond 9.99% for a period of eight years. That effectively rules out a complete takeover of the gaming firm.Ubisoft's drama began in 2015 when French media conglomerate Vivendi took a stake in the European gaming firm, eventually becoming its biggest shareholder. But the Guillemot family were determined to keep the company independent.In 2018, after a three-year battle, Vivendi dropped its pursuit of Ubisoft. Tencent stepped in to buy some of the Ubisoft shares Vivendi offloaded and the Chinese tech giant ended up owning a 5% stake in the games company.Ubisoft has faced a number of challenges including sexual harassment allegations and a lack of new hit titles.Tencent's investment continues a flurry of deals in the video games space this year, particularly from Asian firms, that began with Microsoft's proposed $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard in January followed by Sony's takeover of Bungie, the maker of hit games Halo and Destiny.Tencent, based in Shenzhen, China, has grown into one of the world's largest gaming companies over the years, through acquisitions of and investments in smaller studios with popular global titles including League of Legends maker Riot Games, for example.",

            "description": "Tencent, the biggest social networking and video games company in China, hasn\u2019t really managed to scale its popular products in the Western mainstream. The behemoth\u2019s international expansion for the most part has been achieved by investing in companies outside China, but now it\u2019s upping its on-the-ground presence abroad through its most lucrative business \u2014 video games.In the past two years, Tencent has significantly expanded the footprint of two of its most successful gaming studios, TiMi Studios and Lightspeed Studios, around the world, hiring local executives to run these overseas outposts.To get a glimpse of how Tencent is managing its international gaming branches and what expectations it holds for them, we spoke to Steve Martin, general manager at Lightspeed\u2019s Los Angeles\u2019s outfit. Besides its base in China, Lightspeed now has offices in the U.S., Canada, Singapore, the U.K., France, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and the UAE.IP ambitionsTencent is credited more for its ability to turn established PC games into popular mobile plays than an original developer. Lightspeed, for example, made its name by devising the mobile version of PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds.By May, PUBG Mobile had grossed $8 billion in global lifetime player spending, making it the second top-grossing mobile game in the world trailing behind TiMi\u2019s Honor of Kings, which itself is regarded as a take on Riot\u2019s League of Legends.Tencent now wants players to remember it by its own intellectual property. Under the helm of Martin, who was on the development team of Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2 at Rockstar Games, Lightspeed L.A. office is working on a AAA console game targeting hardcore gamers around the world.While Martin declined to share specifics of the game, he said it will \u201cbe reflective of cultures and sensitivities from across the world.\u201d The game is scheduled to be completed in two to three years.\u201cWhat we are working on is very ambitious,\u201d the executive told TechCrunch.The success of PUBG Mobile is largely thanks to its sheer number of Chinese players. Lightspeed L.A. is clearly going after a more international crowd.China\u2019s console market is taking off after a 15-year ban that ended in 2015. But the industry, which generated $2 billion in revenues in China last year, remains humble compared to mobile and PC games, which brought in $45.5 billion in revenues in 2021, according to industry researcher Niko Partners.AutonomyTencent is known for its hands-off management approach toward its gaming portfolio companies, letting them operate autonomously while providing support as it sees fit.It appears to be keeping the playbook for its in-house studios abroad. While Lightspeed L.A. gets access to tech and operational help from Tencent\u2019s Shenzhen headquarters, in terms of creativity, everything is done in the L.A. office of 83 employees, which will eventually expand to a team of 200, said Martin.After a decade at Rockstar, the gaming veteran joined Tencent because \u201cthere aren\u2019t that many big publishers that give this level of creativity.\u201dMany of Tencent\u2019s executives, including CEO Pony Ma and president Martin Lau, are known to be gamers themselves. \u201cWhen we talk about games with the management, it\u2019s always about what games we love. I\u2019ve had executives who don\u2019t play games at all,\u201d said Martin.Rather than having one single mastermind dictating most decisions at the studio, Martin oversees a collective of directors across disciplines, from creative and animation to technical functions. For example, when the studio is choosing a soundtrack, the top leaders will discuss the options but the decision lies with the audio director. This structure also does away with the bottleneck of having 700 people posing questions to one boss, suggested Martin.\u201cWe want people to feel ownership of the game.\u201d",

However, the project was canceled in April last year, with reports at the time claiming that this was caused by a dispute with Tencent.Amazon Games president Christoph Hartmann has confirmed these reports in an interview with Gamespot, where he alluded to difficulties working with Tencent. Hartmann said that the project ran into difficulties when co-developer Leyou was acquired.\u201cWe had a deal with a Hong Kong-based company, Leyou; I think it would have been great to work with them. But they later got sold to Tencent and it just got very complicated,\u201d said Hartmann.AdvertisementThe Leyou acquisition complicated matters, as Middle-earth Enterprises had a contract clause which stated that it could terminate its right deal if either of its partners were acquired. Middle-earth Enterprises made use of this clause following the acquisition, bringing an end to the project.While it would have been possible for development to continue, Amazon Games decided to step away from the project after negotiations dragged on.\u201cThe question was, sure, maybe [we] could have worked together with Tencent to do something, but I think we\u2019re too big as companies to really turn into partners doing a property together where they own the license and we develop the game,\u201d said Hartmann. \u201cSo we decided it\u2019s better to not work together there. Then we tried to figure something out with both ends, but I think it just dragged on too long.\u201dIn the absence of Lord of the Rings, Amazon has two other MMOs, New World and Lost Ark.\u201cI want to keep on investing in that,\u201d said Hartmann. \u201cI know, it\u2019s not going to be Lord of the Rings, but we have our own fantasy; why not keep building on that.\u201dAdvertisementThe Lord of the Rings IP is now owned by Embracer Group \u2013 who have also acquired a number of studios and IP from Square Enix, resulting in Crystal Dynamics taking control of the Tomb Raider franchise.",

Sony is looking to diversify beyond consoles with its new dedicated PlayStation mobile gaming division. Mateusz Slodkowski | SOPA Images | LightRocket via Getty ImagesSonySony's PlayStation has dominated the gaming console market for a long time. But the business model for console gaming has changed. It's not just about selling the hardware and then hoping people buy new games. It's about continuing to milk revenue from those games via regular updates that people spend money on and selling subscription services too. Sony's deal flow, particularly with the acquisition of Bungie, highlights this push. \"Their goal is to have enough content to incentivize players to buy their proprietary hardware, pay a monthly fee for the subscription service operated by PlayStation (PS Plus), and purchase the occasional digital game through the PlayStation Store, for which Sony receives approximately a 30% cut,\" Tom Wijman, market lead for games at data company Newzoo, told CNBC. \"Snapping up studios is the most failsafe way to ensure exclusive content for their ecosystem \u2014 especially in reaction to the acquisition spree of Microsoft, one of Sony's main competitors in the gaming space.\"Sony is also looking to expand beyond consoles. Last week, the Japanese giant said it is setting up a dedicated unit to oversee the development of mobile games, a relatively new venture for the company, which has been so dominant in consoles for years. The acquisition of Savage Game Studios, which is dedicated to mobile games, is another key part of the strategy. \"Sony is stepping out of their comfort zone to stay competitive,\" Wijman said. Revenue from mobile gaming accounts for more than 50% of the total gaming market, whereas consoles make up about 27% of sales, according to Newzoo. So, Sony is going after an even bigger piece of the pie. Sony's acquisitions will help it bolster its intellectual property and library of games as it looks to expand into mobile gaming.Tencent and NetEaseChina's two largest gaming players Tencent and NetEase have faced a tougher domestic market, amplifying the importance of their investment and acquisition strategies overseas. Last year, Chinese regulators restricted the amount of time those under 18 years old could play online games and froze the approval of new titles. In China, games need the green light from regulators to be released and monetized. Those approvals only restarted in April. Meanwhile, a resurgence of Covid-19 in China and subsequent lockdowns across major cities in the country has hurt economic growth. That led to the worst quarter of revenue growth for some of China's technology giants, including Tencent. With a more challenging domestic market, Tencent and NetEase have looked abroad for growth via acquisitions and investments. \"Tencent and NetEase have built up their gaming business primarily in their home turf China. Now that their home market is becoming increasingly regulated and difficult to operate in, these two companies will accelerate their global expansion strategy,\" Wijman said.watch now",

            "description": "FromSoftware attracting the likes of Sony and Tencent to invest significant amounts in the company is a major showcase of power. Both gaming giants have been involved with acquisitions and investments in gaming companies.Investing in the Elden Ring makers is a different kettle of tea that could have a more profound impact in the coming days.On September 1, parent company Kadokawa Corporation announced the results after issuing a fresh round of shares. Tencent had acquired 16.25%, although the acquisition has been registered against the name of Sixjoy.Sony was the minor investor among the two, with 14.09%. Both giants are now majority shareholders in the company, which has become a renowned name for their soulslike titles.While deals these days aren't surprising, this one seems different. Typically, Tencent and Sony have invested in different types of companies. The former's objective is undoubtedly skewed towards games that rely on the live service model, with its massive involvement in Riot.However, the opportunity for all three parties involved is massive, and each can benefit from the other.Note: This article is subjective and reflects the author's opinion.FromSoftware can utilize resources and experience Sony and Tencent bringFor starters, this isn't a deal like Bungie or Xbox's potential acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Unlike those deals, FromSoftware has sold only a part of its shares, and the studio will retain its autonomy. However, there can be scope for some new avenues for them to explore.Expand TweetTencent has its hands on some of the world's most active live service games. Whether League of Legends and Valorant on PC or Pokemon Unite on mobile, the Chinese conglomerate has some great names on the top-grossing list.As for Sony, they need no introduction, having been a critical player in the console market for decades. The PlayStation brand has become a name to reckon with, and the console giant has had ties to FromSoftware in the past. After all, who can forget the cult hit that is Bloodborne?Expand TweetFollowing the success of Elden Ring, fans have been eagerly waiting to see what the Japanese studio manufactures next. With this investment, there will be a fresh shot in the arm in terms of finances.However, the studio has had no shortage of funds following the pivotal success of its latest IP. Bandai Namco has even expressed interest in expanding it beyond the realms of gaming.The most significant advantage that FromSoftware could obtain from the deal is in the form of new ventures. Some fans feel that the studio has so far been restricted to a similar set of games. Getting someone like Tencent will allow FromSoftware to look into creating a live service game.It's farfetched to think that the Japanese studio will engage in something like that, given the kind of titles they have produced. However, stranger things have happened in this industry.The studio's relationship with Sony could grow closer following the recent decision. They worked together on Bloodborne, and fans have requested a new game in the series for a while. While the acquisition of shares doesn't guarantee anything new, it increases the likelihood of it.As for Tencent and Sony, they can now be a part of the commercial success as FromSoftware is on the rise. The duo will have a share in the profits for one thing.However, it goes much beyond that, as the two can also look to tie up partnerships and collaborations with games made by the Japanese studio.More importantly, it keeps the door open for either or both to acquire more of the studio moving forward. While it might seem unlikely, fans are already seen more peculiar happenings in the video game industry.",

Kadokawa Corporation, the Tokyo-based media corporation that owns FromSoftware, announced in a news release that Sony and Tencent had both purchased significant shares in FromSoftware. Sony Interactive Entertainment (a subsidiary of Sony behind the PlayStation brand) holds 14.09 percent of FromSoftware\u2019s shares; Sixjoy Hong Kong Limited (a subsidiary of Tencent) owns 16.25 percent, bringing the collective stake to 30.34 percent. Kadokawa still maintains majority ownership at 69.66 percent.In the announcement, Kadokawa explained that the three companies had operated a \u201cstrategic alliance in the anime and game fields\u201d since October 2021. Kadokawa said these recent investments would be used to further expand FromSoftware\u2019s expansion into the global market and strengthen the triumvirate formed with Tencent and Sony.Advertisement\u201cThrough the implementation of the fund procurement,\u201d Kadokawa wrote in its press release, \u201cFromSoftware will aim to proactively invest in development of more powerful game IP for itself to strengthen FromSoftware\u2019s development capabilities and will seek to establish a framework that allows the expansion of the scope of its own publishing in the significantly growing global market.\u201dDark Souls (FromSoftware\u2019s most recognizable action role-playing series), \u201cBloodborne\u201d and \u201cSekiro: Shadows Die Twice\u201d are all brutally punishing games. Despite this, the studio\u2019s work is widely cited as a major influence on dozens of other titles such as \u201cStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order,\u201d \u201cGod of War\u201d and \u201cThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.\u201d Many gamers and critics have asked FromSoftware to add difficulty settings to its games; the studio has steadfastly refused so far. FromSoftware\u2019s award-winning creative director Hidetaka Miyazaki has said the uniformly intense challenge in his games is meant to provide players with a sense of accomplishment. This polarizing design philosophy has won FromSoftware a devoted following \u2014 but also a small cadre of detractors who have described the company\u2019s games as alienating.That perception changed with \u201cElden Ring.\u201d FromSoftware\u2019s most recent title, made in collaboration with \u201cA Game of Thrones\u201d writer George R.R. Martin, was a roaring success, selling over 16 million copies.

            "description": "Tencent Holdings and Sony have teamed up to acquire a nearly one-third stake in Elden Ring developer FromSoftware, the studio\u2019s parent company announced on Wednesday.The deal means a Tencent subsidiary owns 16.25% of FromSoftware\u2019s shares, while Sony Interactive Entertainment owns 14.09%. The rest is owned by FromSoftware parent Kadokawa Corporation.Shanghai-based Tencent is the world\u2019s largest video game vendor, owing largely to its dominance within China\u2019s vast market. It\u2019s also well known for taking significant positions in \u2014 if not buying outright \u2014 big-name publishers and developers outside of China.Tencent fully acquired League of Legends maker Riot Games at the end of 2015; Norwegian MMO house Funcom at the beginning of 2020, a roughly 40% stake in Epic Games in 2012; and it is the majority shareholder in gaming companies like Supercell (Clash of Clans), Fatshark (Warhammer: Vermintide 2), and Tequila Works (Deadlight, Rime). Tencent also bought 5 percent of Activision Blizzard in 2013 (freeing that company from Vivendi Universal), but those shares will be purchased by Microsoft in its $68.7 billion bid for the Call of Duty publisher.Sony\u2019s investment reflects its ongoing effort to acquire or strengthen ties to studios well known for making PlayStation games.

            "description": "Tencent has recently completed a massive migration of its business and services to its cloud. This means that Tencent\u2019s internal businesses, including QQ, Weixin, Tencent Video, and Honor of Kings, will be developed and operated based on a public cloud model.Prior to the migration, each service built and operated its own data infrastructure to cope with peak traffic requirements, leaving plenty of unused capacity across Tencent\u2019s operations.The announcement comes four years after Tencent launched an overall strategic upgrade and established a technology committee to migrate its social, games, content, and other businesses to the cloud.\u201cThe migration of our services to a Tencent-owned cloud not only helps us build a future-oriented IT infrastructure and creative R&D culture, but also refines Tencent Cloud products, technologies, and services capabilities, which will help accelerate the digital upgrade of the industry and the overall development of the real economy,\u201d said Daosheng Tang, Senior Executive Vice President of Tencent and President of Tencent Cloud and Smart Industries Group.Seamless MigrationTencent\u2019s technical team was able to move huge and complex businesses to the cloud without impacting the user experience. To maintain peak performance throughout the migration process, the team had to keep losses in computing and virtualization on cloud servers to an absolute minimum.Moreover, the migration process had to ensure supporting the rapid development of emerging businesses. For example:\uff0eWeixin Channels steadily supported large-scale online concerts of musicians such as West City Boys, Jay Chou, and Cui Jian, leveraging the expansion capability of Tencent Cloud. Thanks to Tencent Cloud\u2019s object storage (COS) and live broadcast service, Weixin Channels was able to support peak traffic at a level three times higher than before during special periods such as Lunar New Year.\uff0eRelying on Tencent Cloud\u2019s real-time audio and video product Tencent Real-Time Communication (TRTC), Tencent Meeting was able to provide a smooth and clear video conferencing experience to hundreds of millions of users in complex network environments.\uff0eTencent Cloud's infrastructure and rich product capabilities supported the successful launch and smooth promotion of Tencent's various games in overseas markets, bringing leading gaming experiences to users around the world.Future-oriented Cloud InfrastructureTencent has moved workloads that consume 50 million cores to its cloud, resulting in cumulative cost savings of more than RMB 3 billion (US$446 million).In addition, the new cloud infrastructure has strong DDOS protection and an increased bandwidth 7.6 times greater than pre-cloud migration, promoting and enabling better connectivity between Tencent users.More than Cloud MigrationAt present, Tencent Cloud has created a large cloud-native practice in China. Tencent Cloud's TKE platform has a leading Kubernetes cluster in China and an advanced online-offline co-location technology.At the same time, Tencent Cloud has successively launched many industry-leading products including the Xingxinghai server, a new generation cloud server, Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), and more.Nearly 100 technical achievements from Tencent\u2019s cloud migration efforts have been applied to the public cloud, driving the overall improvement of Tencent Cloud's overall product and technical capabilities.Currently, Tencent Cloud operates in 27 cities across five continents and has more than 2,800 acceleration nodes at home and abroad.",

Little is known about the handheld and the design is kept under wraps \u2013 well, it was, until Evan Blass got involved (the images quickly got removed due to a DMCA complaint).The design looks similar to the one seen in Tencent patent filings for a \u201cPC console\u201d, but that\u2019s no surprise \u2013 there are only so many ways to design a landscape handheld with all the sticks, buttons and triggers necessary for most games.Crucially, the leaked images reveal something important about the actual device \u2013 it runs Android (complete with the Google Play Store), so it isn\u2019t a PC like Valve\u2019s Steam Deck.An unofficial look at Logitech and Tencent's cloud gaming handheldAdmittedly, the platform doesn\u2019t matter too much since this device is focused on streaming rather than native games. Logitech and Tencent said they are in talks to feature Xbox Cloud Gaming and Nvidia GeForce Now on the handheld and both services already have Android apps. The image also shows the Steam icon, so the two companies may have secured another important partner.Here the controls (Logitech\u2019s forte) and connectivity are the key aspects. Speaking of, the image only shows Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. That doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be a 5G version of the handheld for on-the-go gaming, but it does make it more likely (promo images usually show the fully stacked models).As for gameplay scenarios, you may have noticed that there are two Xbox icons. Either that\u2019s a mistake or one is for the Xbox Cloud Gaming service, the other for Xbox Remote Play. Come to think of it, the Steam icon may be for Steam Link (i.e. streaming games from your PC rather than the cloud).Source (DMCA) | Via",

The Humboldt CPO switch device combines Broadcom\u2019s StrataXGS Tomahawk 4 switch chip with four directly coupled and co-packaged 3.2-Tbps Silicon Photonics Chiplets in Package (SCIP) optical engines. Tencent plans to field 2RU boxes based on the Humboldt CPO switch devices in the first half of next year, according to a Broadcom source.The system architecture, which Tencent defined, sees the 4x3.2-Tbps optical CPO interfaces routed to 16 MPO connectors and 32x400G electrical QSFP112 ports. The design enables links from the CPO engine to the front-panel routing to be accomplished via either traditional fiber or flexible printed fiber (FPF). Multiple CW remote laser modules (RLMs) are supported as well.Ruijie Networks Co., Ltd., Tencent\u2019s contract manufacturing partner, will build the switch platforms.\u201cCustomer demands for higher bandwidth have pushed Tencent to perpetually scale our network,\u201d said Sage Zou, vice president of Tencent Cloud. \u201cWe are glad to partner with Broadcom on CPO-based technology, which will bring not only higher bandwidth for applications such as AI/ML and HPC, but also it could address the power constraints from the acceleration of growth in new workloads.\u201dThe CPO approach will enable 30% savings in power and 40% optics cost/bit, according to Rajiv Pancholy, director of hyperscale strategy and products within Broadcom\u2019s Optical Systems Division. Pancholy noted that Tencent owns the design that will drive this implementation; however, he said that other hyperscalers who employ CPO likely will have similar designs. He declined to discuss additional engagements Broadcom has with such hyperscalers, either at 25.6 Tbps or 51.2 Tbps, but implied that such engagements exist. He noted that at 51.2 Tbps, Broadcom will supply 6.4-Tbps SCIP engines based on 100G lanes; support of 200G lanes is on the development roadmap as well. While the RLM here is a Broadcom design, it\u2019s not the company\u2019s intention to the be the sole source; rather, they will release the design for others to produce and supply.For related articles, visit the Optical Technologies Topic Center.For more information on optical components and suppliers, visit the Lightwave Buyer\u2019s Guide.To stay abreast of optical communications technology, subscribe to Lightwave\u2019s Enabling Technologies newsletter.",

            "description": "In today's Finshots we see if the Tencent meltdown will have an impact on IndiaThe StoryLast week, Tencent, the Chinese company behind the massively popular game PUBG, fired nearly 5,500 employees. It was its first layoff in nearly a decade.The reason?The tech company\u2019s revenues fell for the first time since 2004. Its net profits collapsed by nearly 60%. Its share price is down by 40% over the past year. And its future rests on shaky ground.And if you\u2019re wondering why we\u2019re talking about Tencent, well, the company has invested over $2 billion in Indian companies since 2016 \u2014 including names like ShareChat, Lokal, Udaan, Swiggy, and Ola. And since their misfortune may have a bearing on outcomes in India, we need to talk about it.But before we get there, let\u2019s look at the rise of Tencent. And why it seems to be in a spot of bother now.Tencent didn\u2019t begin life as a gaming company. Instead back in 1998, they started off with a computer-based messenger service called QQ. Then a few years later, they decided to do more and launched a social networking service. In 5 years it amassed nearly 500 million active users.Soon, mobiles became ubiquitous and Tencent was quick to capitalise on that. It rolled out WeChat (like Whatsapp), an app for people to message each other. And packaged a payments service into it as well.But that wasn\u2019t enough. It knew that Chinese citizens loved gaming. So it used its captive user base on QQ and WeChat, launched games and then went on a global acquisition spree. Because it could see how vital gaming would be for its future. By 2018, it had become the world\u2019s largest online gaming company and left legacy companies like Activision and EA in the dust.And two decades after Tencent began operations, it had morphed into a gaming behemoth with 30% of its revenues coming from this segment alone. It even broke into the top 10 most valuable tech companies in the world.And this is when problems began to emerge. You see, the Chinese government was watching Tencent\u2019s growth with a hawk\u2019s eye. It could see the impact Tencent\u2019s gaming was having on young kids. They were getting addicted. And the state was worried that this would have an adverse impact on children\u2019s physical and mental development.So out of the blue, the government slammed the brakes. It made a sweeping decree. Children could only play games on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays \u2014 for just one hour each. This move came shortly after a Chinese state media entity called online gaming \u201cspiritual opium\u201d.There\u2019s also the fact that dark memories of 2002 began resurfacing again.Memories of an event that shook the entire nation.In 2002, two teenagers burned down a cyber cafe after they weren\u2019t allowed to play games. The kids were livid because they were addicted. And just like any addict, they lost their cool and burnt the whole place down. The fire sadly killed 24 people.And now, with mobile gaming on the rise, maybe the government feels they have to preempt another crisis. Unfortunately, for Tencent, this has dealt the company a body blow. With 110 million minors playing video games and contributing nearly 3% to the total turnover on Tencent\u2019s gaming platforms, they\u2019ve lost their mojo.If that wasn\u2019t enough, China even stopped approving new games last year. It wanted developers to make games less addictive. And although it restarted gaming approvals in April, it hasn\u2019t yet approved any new games from Tencent\u2019s stables.Through it all, Tencent has been losing market share. They\u2019re attracting fewer eyeballs and this has had a visible impact on their top and bottom line.But that being said \u2014 How does this affect India? How does a Chinese company\u2019s fortune have a bearing on our outcome?Well, Tencent loves investing in Indian companies. This, despite the fact that the Indian government restricts Chinese investments in India. They\u2019ve now set up a couple of entities in Europe and are rerouting investments through the region. For instance, ShareChat counts Zennis Capital BV and Hlodyn BV as investors. But both companies are proxies for Tencent.So the ongoing crisis could impact these investments in two ways.One, it\u2019s possible that Tencent may re-evaluate its investing priorities.When startups go through a cash crunch, they usually reach out to existing investors who have access to company-specific information and are best placed to make a decision quickly. For instance, if a Tencent-backed startup were raising cash right now, they\u2019d probably go to Tencent once again with their pitch for a follow-on round. But if Tencent isn\u2019t on sound financial footing, they may rebuke this proposal. They may even ask Indian startups to pull up their socks and do better, hoping to cash in on investments to bolster their financial position. That\u2019s the extreme case.However, it could also work out in India\u2019s favour i.e. Tencent could double down on investing overseas. They already sense the obvious risk of doing business in China. So maybe they\u2019d relook at Indian gaming companies and see if there\u2019s more potential here. Maybe they\u2019ll funnel more money into the Indian startup ecosystem.So yeah, it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess how Tencent\u2019s misfortune will play out in India. But we will be keeping a close eye on it nonetheless.Ditto Insights: Should you buy a term insurance cover of 2 Cr until the age of 85 or a 3 Cr cover until 65?Well, 45% of people from a recent poll we conducted believe that one should choose a term insurance plan with a \u20182 Cr cover till 85\u2019.But that might not be such a smart move, financially speaking, and here\u2019s why\ud83d\udc47The thing is \u2014 A term insurance plan is most effective when your absence deals your family a financial blow i.e. if something unfortunate were to happen when you\u2019re in your 30s, 40s or your 50s. This is when your family need your income the most. And that\u2019s when they\u2019ll need the money also.The extra 1 Cr from the 3 Cr term plan could make a world of a difference to your children who are yet to graduate or your spouse who\u2019s struggling to pay off your home loan.But let\u2019s say you\u2019re nearing 80, your children are all grown-up and independent, and you\u2019ve probably amassed enough wealth to promise a decent lifestyle. Would a term plan be as useful then? Probably not. And if you factor in inflation, the 2 Cr cover might not even make a significant dent.So in most cases, it makes sense to opt for a higher cover and a shorter duration as opposed to a smaller cover with a longer duration. And if you need help picking a plan, you can always call us at DittoUntil then...Don't forget to share this article on WhatsApp, LinkedIn and TwitterCorrection: An earlier version of the article had erroneously noted that the Chinese government banned consoles after the cyber cafe incident. However, the original ban was implemented in the year 2000. The error is regretted.",

            "description": "Reddit Vote Flip Share 0 SharesWhat all things would you expect from your most advanced text assistant, whether you are writing an academic report or a business email? It would seamlessly autocomplete the text and give perfect text suggestions. It would correct any error that you have made. It would re-structure your sentence for the target audience. It would also generate sentences given keywords. Tencent AI has made Effidit, which is such first of its kind writing assistant that outperforms every available writing assistant in terms of functionalities as well as performance. We will now discuss how they have made it possible.Very-large-scale language models are one of the most popular research topics nowadays as it significantly helps our day-to-day life. Frameworks like GPT are based on a transformer-based encoder and a decoder. The decoder generates the most likely text given probabilities of generating previous texts. This type of modeling cannot produce good quality text, as it tends to produce tokens produced by transformer to be very close to each other; that is, highly similar tokens. This leads to producing repetitive texts at different positions, creating degeneracy. So, the goal is to produce tokens that are discriminative in nature. If the similarities between distinct tokens are low or the token similarity matrix is sparse, then the tokens will, by default, be discriminative.Source: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.01815.pdfYan Wang from TencentAI and his colleagues from Deepmind and other labs created the framework SimCTG (Simple Contrastive framework for neural Text Generation) in early 2022, which addresses the token similarity issue by preserving the sparsity of the token similarity matrix. It trains the language model to pull away distances between two distinct tokens. It does so by training the model to minimize the similarity between different tokens and maximize the similarity with itself. This is a type of contrastive training. The model also maximizes a token\u2019s likelihood given previously generated tokens\u2019 probabilities.To avoid degenerate solutions, they have devised a clever approach for decoding or generating output texts. They have first made a set of most probable candidates predicted by the model. The model\u2019s confidence is the probability of predicting a candidate. The decoded sequence will have the highest confidence of the model, and a penalty is applied for selecting a text which is highly similar to previously generated texts. This will lead to avoiding choosing similar tokens. They have called this decoding method \u2018contrastive search\u2019.Using the contrastive training and contrastive decoding approach, SimCTG achieves to produce high-quality text. Tencent AI has used this method to create Effidit. Currently, Effidit supports writing assistance for only two domains: general texts and academic writing. The key functionalities of Effidit include high-quality phrase and text completion, rewriting texts, and correcting possible errors. It can create sentences given some keywords. The editor also suggests high-quality text while writing. In the future, more improvement of individual functionalities is to be seen.This Article is written as a research summary article by Marktechpost Staff based on the research paper 'EFFIDIT: YOUR AI WRITING ASSISTANT'.

            "description": "China\u2019s Tencent reported on Wednesday its first ever quarterly sales fall, hurt by a lack of game approvals and regulations that limit playing time, as well as Covid-19 lockdowns and a weak economy that squeezed ad sales.The contraction marks a nadir for the gaming giant and owner of the WeChat messaging platform, which has reported double-digit growth almost every quarter since it went public in 2004, as Beijing\u2019s crackdown on big tech companies that began in late 2020 puts the brakes on its expansion.Tencent (TCEHY) plans to sell all or a bulk of its $24 billion stake in food delivery firm Meituan to placate domestic regulators, Reuters reported on Tuesday.The company said on Wednesday revenue declined 3% to 134 billion yuan ($19.78 billion) for the three months ended June 30 from 138.3 billion yuan a year earlier. Analysts were anticipating the decline.\u201cDuring the second quarter, we actively exited non-core businesses, tightened our marketing spending, and trimmed operating expenses,\u201d Ma Huateng, chairman and CEO of Tencent, said.Net profit attributable to equity holders tumbled 56% to 18.6 billion yuan, below analysts estimate of 25 billion yuan.China cut key lending rates on Monday to revive demand as data showed a slowdown in July, indicating the world\u2019s second-largest economy is struggling to shake off the second quarter\u2019s hit to growth from strict Covid restrictions.E-commerce giant Alibaba reported earlier this month flat quarterly revenue growth for the first time in its history.Tencent has been reducing holdings in portfolio companies partly to appease the Chinese regulators and partly to book its hefty profits on those bets, according to sources.The Shenzhen-based giant has lost nearly 60% of its market value since it peaked in February 2021 following Beijing\u2019s regulatory crackdown to rein in the influence of large internet firms. However, the $373 billion company has held onto its crown as China\u2019s most valuable company.Revenue from online games, Tencent\u2019s big profit driver, decreased both at home and abroad, with each declining by 1%. Tencent has yet to receive a new game license from Chinese regulators after they temporarily halted approvals.Its social network services reported a 1% increase in revenue as WeChat earned more from its video content.\u201cIn the short term, that may be its biggest growth driver,\u201d Shawn Yang, manager director of Blue Lotus Capital Advisor said, referring to WeChat video revenue.Tencent reported 18.6 billion yuan ($2.74 billion) in revenue for ads in the second quarter, down by 18%, as advertisers remain cautious with their budgets, but that was not as bad as some analysts had anticipated, according to Yang.",

            "description": "Tencent, the Chinese games and social media giant, revealed a more than 50% drop in profits for the three months to June 2022, the second quarter of its financial year. The figures were affected by a slowing economy in China, an operating environment made harder by regulatory changes and a slowdown in video games as users adjusted to post-pandemic activity.Net profits for the quarter weighed in at RMB19.2 billion ($2.83 billion), which represented a 55% slump compared with the same quarter in 2021, and down 19% compared with the first quarter of the current year. Revenues were RMB134 billion ($19.8 billion), down 3% year of year and down 1% quarter on quarter.Over six months, revenues were down just 1% at RMB270 million ($39.8 billion). But net profits were RMB43 billion ($6.34 billion), a 53% fall.\u201cDuring the second quarter, we actively exited non-core businesses, tightened our marketing spending, and trimmed operating expenses, enabling us to sequentially increase our non-IFRS earnings, despite difficult revenue conditions,\u201d said Pony Ma, Tencent\u2019s chairman and CEO. \u201cLooking forward, we will focus on enhancing the efficiency of our businesses and launching new revenue initiatives, including in-feed advertisements in our popular video accounts, while continuing to drive innovation through R&D. We generate approximately half of our revenues from fintech and business services as well as online advertising that directly contribute to, and benefit from, overall economic activity, which should position us for revenue growth as China\u2019s economy expands.\u201dChina\u2019s slowing economy and the sporadic resurgence of COVID both mean that consumers spent less, denting growth of Tencent\u2019s important commercial payments activity in the second quarter.Paying subscriber numbers across music, games and video increased by 2% to 235 million at the end of June. For Tencent Video, China\u2019s largest long-form video streaming platform, subscription numbers were 122 million, down from 124 million at the end of March.The group is the world\u2019s largest games company in terms of revenue. Within China the sector had been held by government intervention that slowed new game launches and limited user time.\u201cThe domestic [Chinese] game industry is facing transitional challenges including fewer big game releases, lower user spending and measures to protect minors,\u201d the company said in its regulatory filing, published Wednesday. \u201cHonour of Kings\u201d and \u201cPeacekeeper Elite\u201d were the top two highest-ranked games by total time spent across the industry. Each increased their total time spent by adult users year-on-year.

But the company said that owners of existing collectibles will still be able to hold, display or request a refund for their possessions.\"Based on the company's consideration to focus on its core strategy, Huanhe is making adjustments to its business,\" Tencent said in a statement.Huanhe is one of the biggest NFT platforms in China, with new collectibles often sold out instantly upon launch.The move marks a major retreat by Tencent from the NFT market, which has come under increased scrutiny from Chinese regulators. Digital collectibles in the form of NFTs have become popular around the world in recent years, in large part thanks to an active if not highly speculative secondary market.After state media repeatedly highlighted issues around NFT speculation in the country, tech giants including Tencent and Ant Group in June signed a pact to stop the secondary trading of digital collectibles and \"self-regulate\" their activities in the market. read moreThe potential shutdown of Huanhe was first reported by Chinese media last month. In its statement on Tuesday, Tencent did not elaborate on what will happen to the Huanhe brand.Chinese tech giants have trodden carefully with their NFT platforms within mainland China.

Depending on who you ask, this futuristic, blockchain-based space is either the next big thing for marketing \u2014 and for almost everything else \u2014 or an overhyped fad. Here\u2019s what you need to know from this past week:The Chinese tech giant Tencent has stopped selling NFTs in response to regulation concerns from the Chinese government, according to Reuters. Current NFT holders will still be allowed to keep and display their tokens, or they can put in a request for a refund.The term \u2018NFT\u2019 itself has become slightly taboo and rarely used throughout the broader Chinese corporate world, due at least in part to its direct ties with cryptocurrency, which is illegal in China.AdvertisementFTC\u2019s challenge to Meta\u2019s \u201cvirtual reality empire\u201d scheduled for DecemberLast month, the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced that it would seek to prevent Meta and its chief executive Mark Zuckerberg from acquiring the company Within, maker of the popular VR fitness app Supernatural. The FTC claimed on its website that Meta, \u201calready a key player at each level of the virtual reality sector,\u201d is \u201cplanning to expand [its] virtual reality empire with this attempt to illegally acquire a dedicated fitness app that proves the value of virtual reality to users.\u201d The FTC\u2019s Bureau of Competition deputy director John Newman said that \u201cMeta is trying to buy its way to the top\u201d in its planned acquisition of Within.On Monday, Forbes reported that the legal battle between Meta and the FTC has been scheduled for this December. Meta has reportedly agreed to delay the finalization of iots acquisition deal until January 1, 2023, or until the district judge presiding over the case makes a ruling \u2014 whichever happens first.AdvertisementFederal Reserve issues guidelines for crypto banks hoping to access national banking systemThe Federal Reserve \u2014 the United States\u2019 central banking system \u2014 released new guidelines earlier this week that suggest that American banks may soon be able to deal both in crypto and in traditional currency. The 49-page \u2018Guidelines for Evaluating Account and Services Requests\u2019 states that \u201cinstitutions with novel charters, such as cryptocurrency custody banks, and their trade associations\u201d may soon be granted access to \u201cmaster accounts,\u201d which enable access to the Federal Reserve.In June, the crypto bank Custodia sued the Federal Reserve for failing to process Custodia\u2019s master account application for 19 months. Kraken is another crypto bank that's applied for a master account with the Fed. The publication of the new guidelines appear to be aimed, in part, at streamlining the process of approving applications for master accounts to crypto banks like Custodia and Kraken. The new guidelines also emphasize that any American bank looking to become involved with crypto will need to receive approval from the Fed beforehand.Suggested newsletters for you Daily Briefing Catch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team.

Meta's metaverse ploy is surely dying in the dark. pic.twitter.com/j0l6yTYye4 \u2014 Ordinary Things (@ordinarytings) August 16, 2022Mark Zuckerberg just can\u2019t seem to strike the right chord with the rest of the Web3 community. It seems like nearly every time the Meta chief executive tries to advertise something new about his company\u2019s vision for the metaverse, it ends up backfiring. Even his decision to change the company\u2019s name to Meta back in October of last year made many Web3 professionals cringe.Earlier this week, he posted what appears to be a selfie of his Horizon Worlds avatar standing in front of a virtual Eiffel Tower and La Sagrada Familia to advertise the launch of the platform in France and Spain. Twitter, predictably, has not been kind. People made fun of Zuck\u2019s avatar\u2019s blank expression and Horizon Worlds as a whole, which still includes legless avatars. Paul Tassi had this to say in Forbes: \u201cThis is just embarrassing, and yet Zuckerberg seems entirely immune to the embarrassment, or really just does not understand how bad this looks, both literally, the graphics are garbage and it\u2019s bizarre no one has legs after five years of this, but also for him and his company and his grand vision of the metaverse, which he seems to understand less than all of his competition.

Meituan was not immediately available for comment.Shares of Tencent closed 0.8% higher in Hong Kong.Tencent, which owns China's No. 1 messaging app WeChat, is looking to kick off the share sale this year if market conditions are favorable, Reuters reported.A source with knowledge of the matter told CNBC that there are no current plans for Tencent to sell its Meituan stake.Tencent invested in a company called Dianping in 2014 which then merged with Meituan a year later to form the current entity.Investments made by China's technology companies have come under scrutiny as part of Beijing's sweeping crackdown on the country's giants. Chinese authorities have looked to rein in the power of technology giants through tighter regulation in areas ranging from antitrust to data protection.Reuters reported that part of Tencent's reasoning behind the divestment of the Meituan stake is satisfying regulators worried about tech giants backing companies closely related to peoples' livelihoods.Over the past few months, Tencent has been divesting stakes in some of its biggest investments.In December, Tencent said it would divest most of its stake in China's second-largest e-commerce player, JD.com.In January, Tencent raised $3 billion through the sale of some of its shares in Singapore-based gaming and e-commerce firm Sea.Tencent's share sales come at a time of slowing growth for the Chinese technology giant, which has been hit by a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy and stricter regulation on the domestic gaming sector. Tencent is China's biggest gaming firm.Read the full Reuters report here.",

            "description": "While many are rightfully concerned about the growing influence of video-based social media platform TikTok and the Chinese government\u2019s ability to harvest incredible amounts of user data from it, China\u2019s largest social media and video game studio, Tencent, has quietly been acquiring a commanding stake in the most popular video game companies around the world, and no one has seemed to notice. From Riot Games\u2019 flagship title Valorant to the popular Epic Games-produced Fortnite, Tencent and the Chinese Communist Party are inserting propaganda and influencing a generation of children around the world while their parents aren\u2019t looking.Last week, Tencent announced that it aims to acquire a greater stake in the French studio Ubisoft, which is behind popular titles such as Assassin\u2019s Creed and Rainbow Six Siege.In 2018, Tencent acquired 5% of the studio and subsequently began to exert its influence over the company. For example, in 2021, Ubisoft made visual changes to certain games so it could sell them in China. Changes included eliminating gambling symbolism and skulls from playable environments. The company was forced to roll back those changes, however, after players in North America and Europe promised never to play the game again if the changes remained.While the China-friendly changes to some titles were reversed after fans expressed outrage, it is evident that game studios are increasingly worried about pleasing Tencent and the Chinese Communist Party. With this in mind, Tencent\u2019s quest to become Ubisoft\u2019s largest private shareholder should not be taken lightly.During the coronavirus pandemic, Ubisoft released numerous history games and online experiences for children who were forced to learn at home. As many gamers have noted, titles such as Assassin\u2019s Creed possess a remarkable amount of educational value with their accurate modeling of historic cities and monuments. And with the deteriorating quality of our education system, it should be no surprise that kids and parents are turning to video games to help aid in learning.As Ubisoft continues to improve upon these history games and educational experiences, the ability of the CCP to influence and shape these foundational narratives presents a direct threat to kids around the world.Concerns of weaponizing the narrative stories of video games into propaganda only scratch the surface of Tencent\u2019s active campaign to conquer your home. In 2020, the online community highlighted the spyware-like anti-cheat software used in Valorant. The so-called anti-cheat software would launch upon starting your computer\u2014regardless of whether the user opened the game or not\u2014and would monitor all user activity, logging which programs were used. This software broke from the industry standard and was viewed as intrusion into the user\u2019s privacy.While Riot Games quickly denied the allegations and changed the design of its software, many remained unconvinced. After all, this is the same company that hid a data breach of millions of accounts from its users. Even more alarming, in March of 2019, it was revealed that over 300 million user messages sent on Tencent platforms and games were stored on a database used by the Chinese Police.Tencent has established itself as a critical tool of the CCP. The video game company has used its games to spy on Americans and used its digital content to propagandize our children. It has preyed upon the lack of technological literacy of parents across the country, placing their data privacy and their kids in direct jeopardy.Tencent\u2019s quiet rise to global digital dominance is one of the great threats facing American children online. From TikTok to Tencent and your child\u2019s favorite video game, China is committed to influencing our kids and stealing our private data. It is critical that parents begin to take a more active role in curtailing what their kids are playing online.This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal",

            "description": "E arlier this year it suddenly became clear what a subversive force WeChat could become. It happened on April 22nd, when Shanghai was in lockdown. A black-and-white video swiftly went viral among the 1bn-plus Chinese users of the social-media platform owned by Tencent, China\u2019s biggest internet firm. For six minutes, as a camera panned over Shanghai\u2019s skyline, it carried an audio montage of babies crying after being separated from their quarantined parents, residents complaining of hunger, apartment dwellers banging bins, a mother desperately seeking medicine for her child. \u201cThe virus is not killing people, starvation is,\u201d a person cries out. It was a haunting, dystopian scene.Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android Your browser does not support the <audio> element.As Lulu Yilun Chen recounts in her book, \u201cInfluence Empire: The Story of Tencent and China\u2019s Tech Ambition\u201d, China\u2019s web censors swiftly blocked the video, though some netizens sought to defy them by posting it upside down. It was a rare moment when WeChat (Weixin within China) was used to express people\u2019s anger and pain, rather than the blander stuff\u2014swanky dinners, clouds at dusk\u2014that people usually post. WeChat is Tencent\u2019s flagship product, a \u201cSwiss Army Knife\u201d of a super app, offering messages, search, ride-hailing, food delivery and other applications on a single platform. But in a paranoid regime, its power is also a threat.One can only imagine how much the episode must have unnerved executives at Tencent. Since early 2021 its value has plummeted by more than three-fifths, to $365bn, amid a Communist Party crackdown on the consumer-tech industry. It is a firm that in many ways belies stereotypes about China and offers lessons to Silicon Valley. It eschews personality cults. It is obsessively innovative. It takes a radically decentralised view of investment. Yet in recent years, like other tech firms in China, it has been under pressure to bow to the whims of President Xi Jinping. That threatens its reputation in the West, where it is a huge investor in gaming (among other businesses) and where it is keen to expand its reach.Tencent is not easy to chronicle. Other tech giants, including Alibaba, its Chinese nemesis, have been the subjects of riveting bestsellers. Before Ms Chen\u2019s book, Tencent\u2019s only corporate biography was an authorised one by Wu Xiaobo, a management scholar, published in Chinese in 2016. Mr Wu started by lamenting that he had failed to find the secret to Tencent\u2019s success despite more than 60 interviews with senior executives. A big problem for any biographer is the firm\u2019s publicity-shy founder, Huateng \u201cPony\u201d Ma. He is an erudite engineer who seems to hate the sound of his own voice. Ms Chen, a Bloomberg reporter who has covered China\u2019s tech firms for a decade, has spoken to him only once, as part of a gaggle of journalists in 2015.As it turns out, Mr Ma\u2019s reticence is a source of strength, not weakness. What he lacks in outward charisma, he makes up for with steely resilience (\u201cYou either wait for someone to kill you or you kill yourself first,\u201d is how he describes the firm\u2019s constant efforts at reinvention). The lack of a domineering personality lets others thrive, for example Allen Zhang, creator of WeChat, who is equally shy, yet so competitive that he is a master gamer and champion golfer. Most important of all, keeping a low profile has kept Pony Ma personally out of the sort of political trouble Jack Ma (no relation), co-founder of Alibaba, has suffered\u2014though it hasn\u2019t kept Tencent out of the government\u2019s line of fire.Without rigid hierarchies, Tencent can let internal competition run amok, especially when it comes to creating innovative new products. In his book, Mr Wu describes this as \u201cinternal horse-racing\u201d (as it happens, ma means \u201chorse\u201d in Chinese). He says almost all of Tencent\u2019s transformational ideas, including WeChat, came from second-tier teams competing against each other, not from the top brass. Like many Chinese businesses, Tencent has often been accused of plagiarism. But its modus operandi is to make swift, incremental innovations that create blockbusters.Mr Ma\u2019s decentralised approach to the way Tencent deploys capital has been similarly astute. According to Ms Chen, the company has made some 800 investments globally. More than 120 of these have become \u201cunicorns\u201d worth more than $1bn. It owns Riot Games, the franchise behind \u201cLeague of Legends\u201d, and has big stakes in Epic, creator of \u201cFortnite\u201d, another gaming sensation, Meituan, a Chinese delivery app, Didi Global, a ride-hailing giant, as well as numerous other trailblazers such as Spotify and Tesla. It prides itself on taking a hands-off approach to its minority investments. As Ms Chen puts it, it has become an incubator of startups, not a killer of potential competitors.In short, her book\u2014and that of Mr Wu, which it draws upon\u2014paints a picture of a company whose executives are fascinatingly idiosyncratic, and almost as obsessed with products and design as Steve Jobs, Apple\u2019s late co-founder. The trouble is that China\u2019s domestic politics and the messy Sino-American clash make it hard to feel confident about the future.The red PonyThe first problem is internal to China. Tencent is embedded in almost every aspect of life there. It makes money from app fees, traffic (via advertising) and transactions (such as selling virtual goods to gamers), as well as from cloud computing. This has overexposed it to the government\u2019s techlash. Mr Xi\u2019s crackdown on internet firms has hit its gaming arm, its fintech plans and local investments such as Didi. It has to censor itself vigorously.It may hope that expansion abroad will help offset its problems in China. For example, it has plans for the global distribution of \u201cHonor of Kings\u201d, whose popularity at home has already made it the biggest mobile game in the world. But the more it has to compromise with the Chinese government to remain safe, the more its products like WeChat, as well as its games, run the risk of arousing hostility from China hawks in America. As Sino-American tensions worsen, that is a game no one can win. \u25a0Read more from Schumpeter, our columnist on global business:The Spirit deal is a missed opportunity for creative destruction (Jul 28th)Meet Keyence, consultant to the world\u2019s factories (Jul 23rd)Watch Russia\u2019s Rosneft to see the new direction of global petropolitics (Jul 14th)For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, business and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly newsletter.",

            "description": "IntroductionTwo-thirds of internet adults in China use the iQiyi and Tencent Video services to watch online video, according to the Kagan 2022 China Consumer Insights survey. However, the survey also revealed that online video remains supplemental to live (linear) TV programming for most internet adults.* Nine out of 10 internet adults watch online video; iQiyi and Tencent Video are the most popular subscription video-on-demand services.* On average, internet adults in China spend over five hours per day on digital entertainment. Approximately two hours per day is spent watching TV/video content.* Survey data indicates that live (linear) TV-centric viewers are watching more live TV in 2022 than in previous years, while VOD-centric viewers are watching more on-demand video this year than in the past.* TV series programming and short-form video are the most popular types of video content viewed on smartphones. Over half of internet adults said they spend more time in front of the big-screen TV watching live (linear) TV than any other type of video content.Results from the Kagan 2022 China Consumer Insights survey, completed in June 2022, show that 92% of internet adults watch paid or free online video. Over two-thirds (68%) of internet adults said they use iQiyi, owned by online search engine giant Baidu, followed closely by 66% using Tencent Video. Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, is also extremely popular with six out of 10 (61%) internet adults using the service. Bilibili is a video-sharing website, and Youku is an online video service owned by e-commerce giant Alibaba. Mango TV is an online video service operated by the Hunan Broadcasting System.Historical survey data depicts strong user growth for iQiyi, Tencent Video and Bilibili between 2019 and 2021. IQiyi and Tencent Video use peaked in 2021 at 73% and 69%, respectively. The use of Bilibili grew a whopping 20 percentage points over the same time period, matching that of Youku at 42% in 2021. All four online video services saw a modest decline in usage in 2022.Overall use of digital entertainment in China has followed the same pattern as that of the major over-the-top video services, exhibiting strong growth from 2019-2021, followed by a slight decline in 2022. On average, internet adults in China spend over five hours each day on digital entertainment, which includes over two hours per day watching TV/video content. Internet adults also report spending another 1.5 hours per day, on average, listening to music, as well as playing video games. The 2022 survey found that 82% of internet adults play mobile video games, 78% play online/console games and 63% listen to online music.Over the past four years, the percentage of internet adults subscribing to a multichannel TV service has declined 10 percentage points to 69% in 2022. However, this decline is predominantly from an increase in the number of young adults choosing not to subscribe (video cord nevers) rather than those dropping their pay TV subscription (video cord cutters).Historically, over half of internet adults in China have reported watching primarily or mostly live (linear) TV programming, with some on-demand video. In 2022, the survey data showed a 10 percentage point increase among those watching primarily live TV (25%), while those watching mostly live TV with some VOD declined 7 percentage points year over year. Similarly, those watching primarily VOD increased 6 percentage points year over year to 9%, while internet adults who watch mostly VOD with some live TV programming dropped 5 percentage points to 15%. This suggests that existing TV viewing preferences (live TV-centric or VOD-centric viewing) are being reinforced, rather than shifting over time.The 2022 survey found that 36% of average daily TV/video viewing is spent watching on a smartphone, compared to 34% being spent in front of a big-screen TV. Only 20% of average daily TV/video viewing is conducted on the PC, with 11% on a tablet.Six in 10 smartphone users (59%) reported watching TV series programs on the device over the past 30 days. Approximately half of smartphone owners said they have used their mobile devices to watch user-generated video posts (50%) and professional short-form videos (49%). Somewhat surprisingly, 48% indicated they have watched a full-length movie on their smartphone over the past month.At home, live TV programming tends to dominate TV/video viewing. When asked to rank content types by time spent viewing, 52% of internet adults indicated they spend more time watching live TV than any other video content types. One-quarter (26%) of internet adults said they spend the most time watching short-form video, and 9% spend the most time watching news programs. The fact that just 9% said they spend the most time watching paid or free (SVOD/ad-based video on demand) online video services is further evidence that for most internet adults, online video is supplemental to live (linear) TV entertainment.The 2022 Kagan China Consumer Insights survey, conducted in June 2022, consisted of 1,000 adults. The survey has a margin of error of +/-3 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. Percentages are rounded up to the nearest whole number.Consumer Insights is a regular feature from Kagan, a media research group within S&P Global Market Intelligence's TMT offering, providing exclusive research and commentary.",

            "description": "The official trailer for the new Honor of Kings (HOK) has recently been released, creating a lot of buzz among its global fans who are waiting for the game's release at the end of this year.Developed by Tencent Games\u2019 TiMi Studio Group, the mobile game has been among the most popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games since 2015.While being one of the most popular mobile games of all time, what is lesser-known is that Honor of Kings is often used as an ideal testbed for AI research in the games industry.The second AI Arena Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning Competition in China, which ended in April, saw vibrant groups of student developers who built reinforcement learning (RL)-based AI algorithms that can be used to play the HOK autonomously.The winning team, composed of five students from Tsinghua University, said the theoretical capabilities of the RL model were not as easy as imagined when put into practice.\u201cIn the beginning, we couldn\u2019t even set up the game environment, let alone train the AI agent to play games,\u201d team member Chen Huayu said, adding that his fellow team members were already keen players of HOK.Their victory came after spending five months processing the source code and exploring the architecture to compete against 19 teams from top Chinese universities.Rising to the Challenge with RLLike human players, computer game agents are becoming more intelligent as they experience new behaviors and process the appropriate sequence of actions. The technology behind is the RL, a type of machine learning paradigm where developers reward behaviors they wish the AI to manifest and the program trains or learns itself by performing the necessary actions to achieve the desired behavior or outcome.In the past, board games like chess and Go were testbeds of deep RL algorithms. One of the most famous examples is AlphaGo, a computer program developed by Google\u2019s subsidiary DeepMind Technologies. In 2016, AlphaGo played Go against the legendary Lee Sedol, winner of 18 world titles, and won a 4-1 victory.Fast-forward six years, the focus of game AI research has shifted from board games to more complex, non-perfect information games and strategic video games.As a 5V5 multiplayer online battle game (MOBA) game, Honor of Kings is highly complex and challenging and requires extensive collaborations among players. This makes it the ideal environment for AI research and development.During this period, the team from Tsinghua was languishing in the rankings, as others pulled ahead. Sometimes, there were only minor improvements after days of training, or worse, the model would suddenly collapse, and the team had to start again.\u201cIt\u2019s a grinding, slow and boring process that was frustrating at first,\u201d says Chen, adding that then something clicked.\u201cWe thought a lot about what points might lead to mistakes, and made adjustments little by little to the algorithm. Suddenly things got better.\u201d Chen had designed AI agents to learn through countless reiterations. By encountering a scenario thousands of times, the agent was able to calculate the winning percentage of various options and finally choose the optimal solution.Solving Real-life ProblemsThe more complex the environment, the smarter the AI can be trained. Will Yang, General Manager of Tencent AI Lab, explains that games provide an optimal R&D environment with clear goals and indicators that are easier to test and iterate.\u201cWhether it is through the provision of data by human testers or the data generated by AI\u2019s own battles, the data is obtained directly in the virtual world, without the need for additional sensors and processors,\u201d Yang said, noting that the paradigm can also be applied to solve real-life problems more efficiently.Yang added that if AI can learn to perceive, analyze, understand, reason, make decisions and act in real time like people in complex games such as HOK, that hints at its greater potential in solving problems in a wide range of fields including robotics, agriculture, transport, and energy.Tencent AI Arena\u2019s combined strength has allowed the competition to become a platform that brings together the industry players, academia and research institutions.Game environments can continuously improve AI capabilities, precipitate innovative algorithms, and create more general AI tools. It\u2019s conceivable that the next AI milestone could be born in a strategy game, and will be gradually applied to more practical fields such as education and medical care.The Winning FormulaChen said that a clear division of labor, team members\u2019 engineering capabilities, and fully automating the deployment of agents are the keys to a successful RL development in this competition.\u201cWhen something goes wrong with our agent, we know which part of the algorithm is at fault, and our team\u2019s extensive engineering experience helps us find and solve problems faster.\u201dIn the last two months of the competition, Chen\u2019s team was able to fully automate the deployment of agents, even to the point of the AI being able to select the best-performing agent. This allowed them to be more efficient and conduct more experiments than other teams.On top of that, each member was allocated with specific tasks. Chen was in charge of designing algorithms, while one of his teammates kept records and tracked the experiment. One student managed neural network models, and another was responsible for engineering, testing and optimization.The Next-generation of AI PioneersChen led a new team to participate in the 31st FISU World University Games\u2019 Digital Intelligence Competition in March. AI Arena Multi-Agent Competition Track, organized by Tencent, is part of the tournament.The competition is attractive for students and researchers for several reasons, says Chen.\u201cThe use of advanced intelligent algorithms requires a lot of computing power, which is beyond what individual students and even many university laboratories can afford,\u201d Chen said.The large scale of HOK means that it would take years for an individual researcher to run tests that have been undertaken, and the costs can be prohibitive. By participating in the challenge, teams have access to powerful computing resources and cloud services provided by Tencent AI Arena.For such reasons, the competition has become a driving force behind building a new ecosystem of industry, academia, and research institutions to collaborate with students from around the world, including Canada, the Netherlands, Australia, the United States, and China including Hong Kong. It\u2019s not just an opportunity to compete against and connect with other leading universities around the world, but to build relationships with other student developers.Jackie Huang, general manager of Honor of Kings at TiMi Studio Group, says that \u201cwe use HOK in the field of AI and e-sports to build a youthful and energetic student digital intelligence competition exchange platform.\u201d With students from different countries and regions taking part, the competitions help connect talents globally and promote the development of AI research in the game industry.\u201cHOK hopes to promote the symbiotic development model where education, competition and scientific research become the three links of AI industry development,\u201d says Huang.",

            "description": "There\u2019s no pictures of it yet, not even any concept art (pic: Logitech)A portable cloud gaming console is in development at Tencent and, despite the lack of details, it\u2019s aiming to be out later this year.Breaking into the console market is no easy thing when Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo already have such a stranglehold on it. Although that\u2019s not stopped other companies from trying.In recent memory, only Valve\u2019s Steam Deck has managed to achieve major success by virtue of it being a portable PC and having Valve\u2019s name attached to it.This month, Tencent announced it wants its own portable gaming console; one dedicated entirely to cloud gaming and currently set to release later this year.Tencent is partnering with hardware manufacturer Logitech on the so far nameless console. We don\u2019t have any idea what it looks like, but it will support multiple cloud gaming services.The goal is to allow customers to play PC and console games on a dedicated portable console, which is a logical enough idea and something you would\u2019ve thought Microsoft would have done already.As such, Tencent and Logitech are also collaborating with the Xbox Cloud Gaming and Nvidia GeForce Now teams to achieve this.Microsoft is going all in on cloud gaming itself across consoles, computers, and phones (pic: Microsoft)\u2018Logitech G\u2019s leadership in PC and console gaming gear make them an ideal partner to help us realize the vision of bringing a better gaming experience to gamers around the globe,\u2019 says Daniel Wu, general manager of Tencent Games Smart Solution Innovation Lab in a Logitech blog post.Considering how big of a company Tencent is (bigger than any Western publisher), it has the money to pump into a new console that could rival the likes of Xbox and PlayStation.However, cloud gaming is slowly becoming more commonplace. Microsoft is its biggest champion, but even Sony has cloud streaming options that let you play PlayStation 5 games on a mobile phone.Tencent making a dedicated cloud gaming console might be what gives it the edge, but it so far lacks a unique hook, especially as there\u2019s no indication that they are going to operate their own streaming service.Plus, cloud streaming requires a constant and reliable Internet connection, which can be difficult to maintain if you\u2019re on the move.Not to mention this is some unfortunate timing on Tencent\u2019s part since people are spending less money on video games this year.

            "description": "Chinese gaming giant Tencent Holdings wants to buy more of Ubisoft, and even become its biggest single shareholder.A new report from Reuters reveals that Tencent, the largest social network and gaming company in China, revealed the news. \u201cTencent Holdings Ltd plans to raise its stake in French video game group Ubisoft Entertainment SA as the Chinese gaming giant pivots to the global gaming market,\u201d revealed independent sources.Loading PlayIGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! Welcome to 20 questions. Can you guess the game?Tencent acquired a 5% stake in Ubisoft back in 2018 after tensions between Ubisoft and investor Vivendi bubbled over, resulting in Vivendi selling all of its shares and agreeing not to purchase a stake in the company for at least five years.Now, Tencent is looking to expand its reach and has reportedly reached out to the family of Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot to express interest in increasing its stake in the company. At the moment, it\u2019s unclear how much of Ubisoft that Tencent intends to purchase.However, recent reports that Ubisoft was being targeted for acquisition could mean that the Chinese company intends to go big. Quite how big remains to be seen, but Ubisoft is currently valued at $5.3 billion while the Guillemot family owns a 15% stake in the business. That puts the Guillemot stake at around $795 million.It\u2019s said that Tencent could offer up to 100 euros per share to acquire its additional stake \u2013 a big step up from its previous purchase, in which it paid 66 euros per share. Additionally, sources confirmed that Tencent intends to acquire shares from public shareholders in order to become the largest stakeholder in the company. Ubisoft's share price surged 15% after the news was announced by Reuters.Activision Blizzard Deal Compared to Other Major Acquisitions 16 ImagesSpeaking on a recent earnings call, CEO Yves Guillemot said that Ubisoft was open to reviewing offers to buy the company, and neither confirmed nor denied it had been approached by potential buyers.Acquiring developers has been a major strategy for expansion over the last few years, with the likes of PlayStation and Xbox adding developers to their portfolios.Xbox\u2019s purchase of Activision Blizzard set them back $68.7 billion and is set to be one of the biggest deals in the games industry. And with Sony\u2019s purchase of Bungie, it\u2019s easy to see why Chinese giants such as Tencent want to get in on the action.Ryan Leston is an entertainment journalist and film critic for IGN.

A device with the mobility of those, but with a much larger catalog thanks to cloud gaming seems like a no-brainer.When cloud gaming works, it really worksCloud gaming is something of a holy grail for the games industry. As games have gotten progressively bigger, users often don\u2019t have the space to install everything. The issues get bigger if a gamer lives somewhere with a data cap.Grand Theft Auto V, for example, is around 100GB to download. If you download it upfront to play it, that\u2019s space on your hard drive taken up and a chunk of data gone. But if you play it over the cloud, though, you\u2019re only burning roughly 2.5GB of data an hour at 720p resolution.If you beat it or get bored in under 40 hours, you\u2019ve come out on top.I\u2019m lucky that I don\u2019t have a data cap. But I also don\u2019t have a whole lot of space. I also play a lot of different games at the same time, which means installing and deleting pretty frequently. And all of that happens in a computer chair.If Logitech and Tencent want to set me up with the ability to play while lying down on the couch? Sign me up.",

            "description": "Ashraf Ismail, former creative director at Ubisoft Montreal who left following allegations of sexual harassment, has spent the last year working at Tencent. As reported by Axios, Ismail was brought on in 2021 to help lead development of a new game from the Chinese tech giant.Ismail served as creative director for multiple Assassin's Creed titles, including 2018's Assassin's Creed Origins and 2020's Valhalla. He was accused n 2020 of infidelity, particularly through alleged instances of acting inappropriately towards both Ubisoft employees and Creed fans significantly younger than himself. His name was one of many that came up in reports of inappropriate conduct in Ubisoft.Following the allegations, Ismail took a \"leave of absence\" from Ubisoft before Valhalla's release in 2020. Ismail announced on his now-deleted Twitter account that he was leaving to \"properly deal with the personal issues in my life. The lives of my family and my own are shattered. I am deeply sorry to everyone hurt in this.\"At Tencent, he is said to be serving as a \"consultive creative director\" with its TiMi studio, and is said to have been involved with the studio since its opening. TiMi is staffed by several ex-Ubisoft Montreal employees, several of whom are said to have worked with Ismail.A representative for TiMi told Axios that Ismail \"has carried himself in a professional manner and has consistently shown an eagerness to learn and grow as both a team member and person. We strive to provide a safe, respectful working environment for all and will continue to do so as our team grows and expands.\u201dUbisoft is still dealing with its allegationsSeveral employees at Ubisoft were named during those original allegations in 2020. Editorial team head Serge Hasco\u00ebt, Canadian operations head Yannis Mallat, and human resources lead C\u00e9cile Cornet each had respective allegations of misogyny and homophobia, or allowing said conduct to continue. All three have since resigned from Ubisoft.Further reporting has shown that Ubisoft's issues encompass their global studios. Skull & Bones developer Ubisoft Singapore has faced similar allegations of sexism, racial insensitivity, and abuse. Like at Ubisoft Montreal and Quebec, the harassment was said to have been done by individuals in management positions.Following the reports, the pro-worker group A Better Ubisoft was established in July 2021. Hoping to improve working conditions and institute industry-wide policies for all developer studios, the group has yet to have its demands met by Ubisoft in any capacity.",

            "description": "It\u2019s been two years since a workplace reckoning over sexual misconduct at Ubisoft led to numerous departures, resigniations, and firings. Now one of the people investigated has resurfaced. Ashraf Ismail, previously creative director on the hit Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla, is now working for competitor Tencent, Axios reports.More specifically, Ismail is working for TiMi Studio Group, the Chinese conglomerate\u2019s mobile gaming juggernaut, as a \u201cconsulting creative director,\u201d a rep confirmed to Axios. TiMi is responsible for Pok\u00e9mon Unite, mobile adaptations of Call of Duty and PUBG, and a host of other games. It also opened an office in Montreal last year to develop an \u201cambitious AAA, service-driven open-world game across multiple platforms.\u201dAdvertisement\u201cDuring our work with Ash, he has carried himself in a professional manner and has consistently shown an eagerness to learn and grow as both a team member and person,\u201d a spokesperson for TiMi Studio Group told Kotaku in a statement. \u201cWe strive to provide a safe, respectful working environment for all and will continue to do so as our team grows and expands.\u201dAdvertisementIsmail did not immediately respond to request for comment.Ismail began working on the Assassin\u2019s Creed franchise in 2009 with Assassin\u2019s Creed IV Black Flag. He was then game director on Origins before being promoted to creative director on Valhalla. Prior to his dismissal he helped chart the series\u2019 pivot toward being open-world RPGs. His name ended up being removed from Valhalla\u2019s credits.AdvertisementRead More: Ubisoft Employees Have \u2018Gave Concerns\u2019 Over Misconduct AllegationsThat\u2019s because he was fired from Ubisoft in August 2020 after being investigated for misconduct, though the company never disclosed details of its findings. Earlier that summer, the veteran developer had been accused of leveraging his status and lying about not being married to prey on women who were relatively new to the gaming industry. It soon gave way to a load of allegations about other employees at the company, eventually culminating in high-profile resignations of several key executives.AdvertisementDespite the initial purge and HR audits, some current and former employees say the company stopped short of completely overhauling its workplace culture. In 2021 the worker group A Better Ubisoft called on management to give it a seat at the table in reviewing misconduct cases and helping the company improve.Hundreds signed an open letter, but a year later they say management has yet to respond to their demands. On the one-year anniversary of the letter , the group tweeted today that 25% of the employees who signed it have since left the company, and that a disproportionate number of them were women. One current employee who signed the letter called the trend \u201cvery worrying.\u201dAdvertisementIf you\u2019re a current or former developer with a story to share about working at Ubisoft, my inbox is always open: ethan.gach@kotaku.com (Signal and Proton upon request).\u201c There\u2019s nothing more I can say about ABU\u2019s demands or management\u2019s response to them because there\u2019s been nothing,\u201d the person, who wished to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak to the press, told Kotaku. \u201cNo attempt to reach out, no new measures to meet them.\u201dAdvertisementUbisoft has pushed back against accusations of attrition in the past, saying they fall within normal rates for the industry. But last fall, the company implemented unprecedented pay raises at its Montreal studio to try to keep talent from leaving. While people have left for all different sorts of reasons, the staffer exodus has impacted Ubisoft\u2019s game releases.\u201cTotal staff numbers have remained fairly flat, because Ubi is still able to hire lots of juniors,\u201d the current employee argued. \u201cBut the huge loss of all that experience and knowledge has clearly hit our productivity very hard, and we\u2019re now seeing new delays and canceled games.\u201dAdvertisementUbisoft confirmed some of these delays and cancelations during its most recent earnings call. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora will no longer arrive in time for the new movie, and a new unannounced mini-Assassin\u2019s Creed game is also behind schedule. Meanwhile, Ghost Recon Frontline was one of the multiple projects recently canned. Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot also called on staff to cut back spending to only \u201cwhat is essential\u201d ahead of a possible recession in a recent company- wide email.Ubisoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

            "description": "But newly released internal documents reveal that Roblox assumed and prepared for the possibility that any Chinese partner it worked with could try to hack Roblox. On top of that, Roblox expected Tencent to copy the game and create its own version of it.Last year, Roblox launched a version of its game in China called LuoBuLeSi. Like other Western gaming companies that have entered the lucrative but heavily regulated Chinese market, it had to partner with a Chinese company, Tencent, who would operate the game in the country, and Roblox had to host user data on local servers, as required by law.There is no evidence that Tencent did target Roblox. The documents were originally obtained and then published online this month by a separate, criminal hacker who attempted to extort Roblox. Motherboard is publishing details from the documents despite them being obtained by a criminal hacker because of the overriding public interest in understanding the highly controversial steps major companies might take in order to break into markets in authoritarian countries.The documents also show the steps Roblox had to take in order for its game to comply with Chinese censorship laws: any maps created in the game had to \u201crespect the integrity of the country and not misrepresent the Chinese territory,\u201d including by recognizing Beijing\u2019s claim of self-ruled Taiwan as part of its territory, according to a presentation given to Roblox by Tencent. Users and developers also \u201cmust not tamper with historical facts\u201d and \u201cmust not appear any images or names of national leaders.\u201d\u201cExpect that hacking has already started,\u201d one slide in a presentation from 2017, called \u201cChina MVP Ideas from Aug Trip; CONFIDENTAL,\u201d read. The slide dates from before Roblox ultimately announced a partnership with Tencent. \u201cExpect it to ramp up after a deal is signed, possibly even by partner.\u201dIn 2017, the Chinese market seemed wide open for Roblox. Although Tencent was likely to create a similar platform, and seemed to have one in the works in the wings, Roblox had no copycats in China yet, according to the slides. Roblox also pointed to Tencent\u2019s repeated failures at launching user-generated content (UGC) gaming in the past few years.Roblox, meanwhile, had a massive back catalog of user-made content it could bring to China. After games were translated to Chinese, Roblox could then make some of them visible in the country. The company had its own engine that developers around the world used to create their own virtual worlds. Roblox also had a strong social component, something that Chinese gaming company NetEase strongly recommended strengthening through top creators, the slides add. \u201cEducational angle is a big advantage for us,\u201d one of the slides reads.Do you work at Roblox? We'd love to hear from you. Using a non-work phone or computer, you can contact Joseph Cox securely on Signal on +44 20 8133 5190, Wickr on josephcox, or email joseph.cox@vice.com.Roblox also expected a group of hundreds of people to be working on reverse engineering any code that the company placed on Chinese servers.\u201cAll players have national ID and real name, so less concerned about bad behavior towards children\u2014easy to find the predators,\u201d a related slide reads. Child predators are something that the main Roblox company fights off constantly.One slide that listed what Roblox needed to do to launch in China noted that the requirement that would take the most effort would be setting up local web servers. All personally identifiable information for Chinese players was not allowed to flow at all across the Great Firewall, the slides said. Other tasks included implementing phone authentication with SMS validation, something that Roblox was \u201cdoing anyway,\u201d it reads. This authentication would use a \u201cgovernment validation API\u201d and Roblox would also gather national IDs, the slides add.At least in the short term, the plan was to entirely segment the Chinese version of Roblox from the international one. Although Chinese law allows non-Chinese players to play on the Chinese servers, those international players would also be subject to all Chinese laws, including those around data usage, the slides read.Roblox had to carry out all of this preparation in part because the government review process takes 8 to 9 months, according to the slides. \u201cSome missing translations are OK, but all critical features are required for both efficiency and government relations,\u201d one slide reads.\u201cConclusion: Do not allow in near term\u2014kids won\u2019t understand this, and will likely lead to other concerns or difficult decisions,\u201d one slide reads, adding that this could change over time. \u201cConclusion: Do not allow in near term\u2014kids won\u2019t understand this, and will likely lead to other concerns or difficult decisions,\u201d one slide reads, adding that this could change over time.The internal Roblox documents published by the hacker also detailed Roblox\u2019s content moderation strategy, including teams of human reviewers and technology to assess user-generated content such as games, as well as the contents of messages between players. Given China\u2019s intense censorship efforts, especially around user created content such as social media posts, Roblox would have to export that moderation effort to the country and potentially bring in another operator.

            "description": "Weixin Pay users have helped reduce carbon emissions by 188,200 tons in the past five years by choosing the digital payment platform instead of generating paper receipts, according to a recent report published by Tencent and the Central University of Finance and Economics of China.The report - titled, \"Green Payment Contributes to China\u2019s Carbon Neutrality,\u201d showed that an increasing number of users have been using Weixin\u2019s popular payment feature to pay their utility bills, buy transportation tickets and medicines online.Weixin Pay services are becoming increasingly popular. The graph above shows the growth rate of Weixin Pay usage from 2017 to 2021.In particular, Weixin Pay helped cut around 3.34 million tons of travel-related carbon footprint in the same period, by helping people travel less via bus and metro to purchase goods or settling payments at banks.\u201cGreen payment promotes markets moving into green transformation,\u201d the report said, adding that it effectively leads to behavioral change at institute, companies, household and individual levels.More than a FadOnline payment services are riding high on the e-commerce boom for their obvious benefits, such as buying goods and services online with just a few clicks.What is often forgotten is that it is also a sustainable model for the green future of finance.More than 82 percent of some 5,000 surveyed respondents, aged between 20 and 49, said they plan to use green payments more in the future to support reducing carbon emissions.These steps toward sustainability align with Tencent\u2019s pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030, as it reins in emissions across its operations and supply chain to create a more sustainable future.The EcosystemCompared to traditional payment systems, green payment shares the characteristics of financial swaps and bond transfers to act as an infrastructure in the economic and financial system. Shortly put, it guides and allocates resources.Relying on the high penetration rate of electronic payment, green payment drives green consumption and acts as a promising impetus for the further expansion of the carbon inclusion system.At the industry level, green payment not only drives the digitalization of the payment industry, but also acts as a bridge between merchants and other industries. For example, big data and AI used in green payment systems can help enterprises optimize their need and supply chain, improving their efficiency. At the consumer level, green payment influences consumer behavior and habits, educating them on green consumption concepts and shaping low-carbon lifestyles.Weixin Pay, for example, carries out public awareness campaigns on how consumers can engage in various green payment scenarios. In June, Weixin Pay launched a low-carbon quiz challenge for users to answer questions related to carbon neutrality. Nearly 600,000 people participated in the activity, and the number of answers exceeded five million within three days.In the \"Low-Carbon Quiz Challenge\" activity, users compete to get a higher ranking nationwide by answering 100 questions related to carbon neutrality.In another campaign, the platform worked with different merchants and brand partners to encourage consumers' low-carbon lifestyles. Users can exchange low-carbon benefits offered by merchants by accumulating low-carbon consumption behaviors, such as bringing their own coffee cups. As of now, hundreds of thousands of users have signed up and completed at least one low-carbon behavior.A consumer earns points at the Tims Coffee by bringing her own coffee cup.Planet-wide ProjectDespite the increasing green payment options for consumers, the report showed that only about 35 percent of users identified scenarios involving the environmental effects of green payment.However, due to the limited carbon related knowledge, the public awareness on the specific environmental effects behind digital payment options still has a large room to improve through public education, the report showed.\u201cThe promotion of green payment is particularly important. When people embrace the concept, sustainable lifestyle becomes a habit and it helps move society toward green transformation,\u201d the report noted.",

            "description": "The recent rebound brings Chinese mega-scale tech firms back up 20% from the lows, but they have yet to shrug off share price weakness.For Tencent (00700), the share price recovery lost steam as its largest shareholder, Prosus, announced on June 27 it would gradually pull investments from the Chinese firm. Tencent has undergone its repurchase program for 10 trading days in a row. Since the beginning of 2022, the company bought its own shares worth HKD9.4 billion.Ivan Su, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, describes the share sale plan by Amsterdam-based Prosus as a surprise. This was because the Dutch firm, owning a 29% stake in Tencent, had agreed not to sell further shares after the disposal of a 2% stake in 2021.However, Su believes the decision was made to finance a share-buyback program that aims to narrow a long-standing discount that Prosus\u2019 shares trade to its net asset value.\"We do not view Prosus\u2019 decision to sell the stock as indicative of any fundamental changes to Tencent\u2019s business,\u201d says Su, retaining his fair value estimate at HKD 741 per share.That means Tencent now trades at half his fair value estimate. While Tencent is challenged by the macro headline, which likely will lead to earnings declines for the next one to two quarters, Su believes that a turnaround is in clear sight for three reasons: 1) game license approvals are coming back on track; 2) Beijing is signaling support to internet giants; and 3) cities like Shanghai continue to exit from coronavirus lockdowns.What Is a Share Buyback?Share buybacks are one of the ways that companies return cash to shareholders.Although the market may perceive the initiation or increase of a share-repurchase program as a signal managers believe their stock is undervalued, which can push its price up, this is not necessarily predictive of future performance.The repurchase itself tells little about a firm\u2019s financial health, as the program can be financed by debt, rather than by excess cash generated by the core business. It also would not be desirable to overlook other attributes like longer-term competitive advantages and business strategy.Other than a Morningstar star rating or a fair value estimate, investors can use the Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating to assess a company. The rating considers three key metrics in a stock (balance sheet, investment, and shareholder distributions) which company management has control over and can spend money on.Look at Capital AllocationIn the case of Tencent, the stock warrants an Exemplary Capital Allocation Rating. This top rating reflects that Tencent has a sound balance sheet, exceptional investments, and appropriate shareholder distributions.\"We think investments back into the business are most likely to be the key driver of total shareholder returns and are appropriately prioritized over other capital returns such as dividends and buybacks. For Tencent, we remain confident in its longer-term free cash flow potential,\" Su says.In terms of returning cash to investors, Tencent has also been paying some dividends.Over the past three years, the firm has paid its shareholders an average of roughly 8% out of the earnings. That implies the growth stock yields less than 1%. Su explains: \"Given the group\u2019s capital deployment strategy will remain centered around investments, we expect dividend policy to remain stable over the near term.\"",

            "description": "article-article-bodyChina\u2019s digital economy has advanced rapidly over the past two decades, with services, communications and commerce moving online.The Chinese government has generally encouraged its citizens to accept digital technologies in all aspects of daily life. Today China has around a billion internet users.China has made clear it aims to be a global leader in digital infrastructure and technologies. Leadership in digital tech has been deemed critical to China\u2019s future economic growth, domestically and internationally.Like Western countries, China has seen the rise of a handful of dominant digital platform or \u201cbig tech\u201d internet companies. We studied China\u2019s recent efforts to regulate these companies, which may hold lessons for Western nations trying to manage their own big tech problems.China\u2019s \u2018big four\u2019 tech companiesChina\u2019s biggest tech firms are Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent and Xiaomi (often collectively called BATX for short). Broadly speaking, Baidu is built around search and related services, Alibaba specialises in e-commerce and online retail, Tencent focuses on messaging, gaming and social media, and Xiaomi makes phones and other devices.Like their Silicon Valley counterparts Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple (or GAFA), the BATX companies dominate their competitors. This is largely thanks to the enormous network effects and economies of scale in data-driven, online business.The BATX businesses (again, like GAFA) are also known for gobbling up potential competitors. In 2020, Tencent reportedly made 168 investments and/or mergers and acquisitions in domestic and international companies. Alibaba made 44, Baidu 43 and Xiaomi 70.The tech crackdownIn the past 18 months or so, the BATX companies have come under increased scrutiny from the Chinese government.In November 2020, an IPO planned for Ant Group, an affiliate of Alibaba, was effectively cancelled. Ant Group was forced to restructure after Chinese regulators \u201cinterviewed\u201d the company\u2019s founder.The following month, Alibaba\u2019s Ali Investment and Tencent\u2019s Literature Group were fined RMB 500,000 (about $110,000) each for issues relating to anti-competitive acquisitions and contractual arrangements.At the same time, China\u2019s General Administration of Market Supervision opened a case against Alibaba for abuse of its dominant market position in the online retail platform services market.In March 2021 more fines were issued including to Tencent and Baidu. They were fined RMB 500,000 each for anti-competitive acquisitions and contractual arrangements.Then in April 2021, Chinese authorities met with 34 platform companies, including Alibaba and Tencent, to provide \u201cadministrative guidance sessions\u201d for internet platforms. That month Alibaba was also fined a spectacular RMB 18.228 billion (around $4 billion) and Tencent another RMB 500,000 for anti-competitive practices.In July 2021, Chinese authorities prohibited a merger between two companies that would have further consolidated Tencent\u2019s position in the gaming market.The government\u2019s efforts are ongoing. Earlier this week, regulators imposed new fines on Alibaba, Tencent and others for violating anti-monopoly rules about disclosing certain transactions.What\u2019s motivating Chinese authorities to intervene?The evolution of China\u2019s digital giants shows how data-driven markets work on a \u201cwinner takes all\u201d basis in both state-managed and capitalist economies.The BATX companies now wield significant social and economic power in China. This conflicts with China\u2019s ideological commitment to state-managed social order.In January 2022, President Xi Jinping called for stronger regulation and administration of China\u2019s digital economy. The goal, he said, was to guard against \u201cunhealthy\u201d development and prevent \u201cplatform monopoly and disorderly expansion of capital\u201d.State-orchestrated social order is not possible where there is an excessive accumulation of private power.China\u2019s digital policy agenda is designed to achieve strong economic growth. However, the Chinese Communist Party also seeks to maintain strong state control over the structure and function of digital markets and their participants to ensure they operate according to Chinese values and Chinese Communist Party objectives.What can we learn from China\u2019s approach to \u2018big tech\u2019?How can we regulate digital platforms, particularly to improve competition and public oversight? This remains a largely unsolved public policy challenge.Australia and the EU, like China, have demonstrated significant willingness to take up this challenge.In Europe, for example, where the US platforms dominate, policymakers are actively seeking to achieve independence from foreign technology companies. They are doing this by improving their own domestic technology capacities and imposing rules for privacy, data collection and management, and content moderation that align with European values and norms.While the EU and China are aiming at very different goals, both are willing to take a significant role in regulating digital platforms in accordance with their stated economic, political and social values.This stands in stark contrast to the situation in the US, which has so far had little appetite for meaningfully restricting the behaviour of tech companies.In theory, China\u2019s centralised political power gives it space to try different approaches to platform regulation. But it remains to be seen whether Chinese authorities can successfully overcome the tendency for monopolies to form in digital markets.If China succeeds, there may be valuable lessons for the rest of the world. For now we must wait and watch.Joanne Gray is a lecturer in digital cultures at the University of Sydney, and Yi Wang is an early career researcher and sessional academic in creative industries, digital platforms and knowledge exchange at the University of Sydney.This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

            "description": "The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), the country's top market regulator, imposed a fine of 500,000 yuan ($74,700) each on companies including Alibaba Group, Tencent Holdings and SoftBank Corp for violating the Anti-Monopoly Law, according to its official website on Sunday.The SAMR said these companies were found to have not declared the concentration of business operators as per legal requirements. The concentration of business operators is when a business operator obtains control over another participant in the same area, which may lead to a monopoly.All of the cases are about mergers and acquisitions, including Alibaba's acquisition of Best Inc, Tencent's purchase of Okaybuy (China) Holding Inc, as well as Ping An Healthcare And Technology Co's establishment of a joint venture with SoftBank.\"In spite of small penalty, the punishment has a more significance in sending a warning to other companies in cracking down on monopoly,\" Liu Dingding, a Beijing-based internet industry veteran analyst, told the Global Times on Sunday, adding that more such reviews are expected.In January, the SAMR fined a number of companies, including Alibaba, Tencent and Chinese video sharing platform Bilibili, for failing to properly report over a dozen deals, issuing a fine of 500,000 yuan per case. The fines are the maximum under the country's existing Anti-Monopoly Law.The penalties came as the country ratchets up a crackdown on monopolistic behavior in recent years, especially on platform companies abusing their dominant market positions, in an effort to foster a fair, transparent and predictable environment for business operators.In June, the top legislature passed an amendment to the Anti-monopoly Law, which makes it clear that the country will formulate and implement competition rules compatible with the socialist market economy and improve a unified, open, competitive and orderly market system. The amendment will take effect on August 1.A major revision of the legislation focuses on how to deal with new challenges brought about by digital economy and properly regulate platforms, as certain clauses within the existing anti-monopoly law have been rendered incompatible with the country's fast-evolving economic landscape.The revised law will further regulate monopolistic behaviors under a set of standardized rules, while building a sound and vibrant market environment to foster innovation and entrepreneurship, Liu said.",

The company's deals team also has staff in Hong Kong, they added.Alibaba did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Alibaba and its main rival Tencent (0700.HK) planned to cut tens of thousands of jobs combined this year in one of their biggest layoff rounds as the crackdown and China's COVID-19 curbs stifled growth, Reuters reported in March. read moreTikTok owner ByteDance also shrunk its investment team and was dissolving a sub-group focused on financial returns in response to regulatory crackdowns in China, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters in January. read moreChinese regulators launched an unprecedented campaign in late 2020 to rein in the country's technology giants after years of laissez-faire approach that drove growth and dealmaking at breakneck speed.On Sunday, China's market regulator imposed the latest fines on Alibaba and Tencent as well as a range of other firms for failing to comply with anti-monopoly rules on the disclosure of transactions. read moreThe regulatory crackdown, coupled with a slowing economy, has sharply slowed sales growth for most of the internet companies, smashed their share prices, and made new capital raising and business expansion much tougher.That, in turn, has forced companies such as Alibaba and Tencent to look for ways to cut operating costs.Chinese billionaire Jack Ma's Alibaba was one of China's most active corporate investors, having built an ecosystem of portfolio companies across sectors including retail, local services and media and entertainment.Alibaba has attracted talents from major Wall Street banks and private equity funds, including veteran Goldman Sachs dealmaker Michael Evans, over the years to strengthen its in-house dealmaking capabilities.In 2016 when Chinese firms were actively snapping up assets globally, Alibaba's internal investment team grew to about 150 people, three times larger than that of Tencent, in a bid to sustain its global dealmaking drive, Reuters has reported.From 2015 to 2021, Alibaba on average made about 44 investments every year, peaking in 2018 with 70 deals totalling $54 billion, according to Dealogic. Even during the 2021 regulatory crackdown, it cut 38 deals totalling $6.2 billion. This year so far, however, Alibaba has made just nine investments worth $5.2 billion.The company started laying off employees from its other business units in February and could ultimately axe more than 15% of its total workforce, or about 39,000 staff, Reuters reported in March.Reporting by Julie Zhu and Kane Wu; Editing by Sumeet Chatterjee and Susan FentonOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

At the same time, Tencent will provide its expertise in the field of car networking security to support Mercedes-Benz\u2019s R&D of automated driving in China.SEE ALSO: Mercedes-Benz and Geely\u2019s Smart #1 UnveiledTencent and Mercedes-Benz have completed many years of cooperation. In 2015, Mercedes-Benz became the first luxury car manufacturer to cooperate with Tencent to launch \u201cMyCar,\u201d an innovative service to meet the needs of Chinese customers. In the future, the two sides say they are also willing to explore the possibility of cooperation in more fields.In addition, Cailian Press learned from individuals familiar with the matter that Tencent \u2018s in-car navigation product, \u201cSmart Driving Map,\u201d which was released at the end of last year, is still undergoing normal progress and is expected to be mass-produced in the second half of this year. The product was originally scheduled to be launched with new cars in batches during the second quarter, but the production of the car companies themselves was affected by the resurgent pandemic at that time.",

            "description": "Two senior executives at Tencent Holdings are stepping down from their vice-president roles at the internet giant to focus on jobs in affiliate companies, according to a report by Chinese financial media outlet Caixin.The Caixin report said Cheng Wu, who was responsible for marketing, and Jim Lai Chi-ming, who was responsible for fintech development, will no longer hold the positions of vice-president at Tencent, citing an internal memo. A person familiar with the situation confirmed the contents of the memo to the Post. Tencent did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Cheng will remain the chief executive of China Literature, China's largest web novel publisher and majority-owned by Tencent, and Lai will continue in his role as the chairman of Fusion Bank, a virtual bank in Hong Kong jointly established in 2020 by Tencent, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Asia) and other partners.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.Cheng joined Tencent in 2009 and in 2013 helped found Tencent Literature, which later merged with rival Cloudary to become China Literature. Cheng was appointed as the chief executive of China Literature in 2020, when Tencent replaced the platform's founding team with veteran executives from the parent company.Lai, who also joined Tencent in 2009 and who has been heading up its fintech unit, remains the chairman and non-executive director of Fusion Bank.The Shenzhen-based company's latest management reshuffle comes amid its recent efforts to control costs and improve efficiency amid stagnating growth, including job cuts and the implementation of a new promotion and assessment system.Tencent has cut jobs across multiple business units, including cloud computing and video content. Tencent has also laid off about 100 people from its sports channels.Story continuesIn March, Tencent president Martin Lau Chi-ping said the company would exit or streamline some noncore businesses to control headcount, a point founder and chief executive Pony Ma Huateng reiterated in an earnings call last month.Last month, the company also adjusted its performance review system for employees with a simpler assessment system, a week after the company slowed the pace of pay rises following promotion.Promoted personnel are no longer entitled to an \"immediate\" salary increase, Tencent told workers in an internal memo sent out on June 2. The salary review process was also pushed back a month, from June to July, so that it can be combined with employees' performance assessments.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

            "description": "Naspers\u2019 logo is pictured on a smartphone in front of a stock graph displayed in this illustration taken December 4, 2021. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration Acquire Licensing RightsLONDON, June 27 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Naspers (NPNJn.J) has finally realised the value of simplicity. The South African company\u2019s main asset is a 29% shareholding in Chinese internet giant Tencent (0700.HK), currently worth $133 billion. But Naspers has consistently traded at a big discount to that stake, while tying itself in increasingly complicated knots to close the gap. A pledge on Monday to slowly sell some Tencent stock and return the cash to shareholders has the merits of being both intelligible and reassuring.The 16% bump in Naspers\u2019 Johannesburg-listed shares on Monday morning will come as a relief to Chief Executive Bob van Dijk. To date, the Dutchman\u2019s efforts to narrow the gap between Naspers\u2019 market value and that of its underlying assets have mainly benefitted lawyers and corporate financiers rather than shareholders. Despite spinning off an Amsterdam-listed subsidiary, Prosus (PRX.AS), in 2019, the gap has sometimes widened to 60% or more.The latest plan helps in two ways. First, the open-ended scheme to sell Tencent shares in the market and use the proceeds to buy back Naspers and Prosus stock effectively creates a put option for investors.Second, van Dijk is sending a clear signal that the company\u2019s Tencent riches will be returned to shareholders, not frittered away on some high-risk internet startup. That was more than a theoretical risk: Prosus recently wrote off its 28% holding in VKontakte, Russia\u2019s equivalent of Facebook.The latest move does nothing to address other factors weighing on Naspers\u2019 valuation. The company\u2019s clunky governance structure, in particular the super-voting shares that kick in as soon as either it or Prosus looks remotely vulnerable to a takeover, stay in place. Naspers also remains vulnerable to South Africa\u2019s currency swings and faces a liability for capital gains tax on its Tencent investment.The company will remain a big Tencent shareholder for a long time. To avoid weighing on the Chinese company\u2019s share price, Naspers and Prosus say they will only sell up to 5% of the average daily trading turnover, at most about 1 million shares a day. At that rate, it would take until 2033 to dispose of all the shares. And by keeping his wording vague \u2013 the buybacks will last as long as the discount remains \u201celevated\u201d \u2013 van Dijk has scope to slow the pace if the gap narrows as planned. There\u2019s beauty in simplicity after all.Follow @edwardcropley on Twitter(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)CONTEXT NEWSSouth Africa\u2019s Naspers and Amsterdam-listed Prosus on June 27 announced an open-ended programme to buy back their shares, funded by the gradual sale of their holding in Chinese internet giant Tencent.Prosus, which is 73%-owned by Naspers, holds a 28.9% stake in Tencent. Historically, Naspers and Prosus have traded at a significant discount to the value of the Tencent holding.The pair said sales of Tencent stock were unlikely to amount to more than 3%-5% of the average daily trading volume in the Chinese company\u2019s shares. The programme would remain in place as long as the discount was at \u201celevated levels\u201d.Separately, the two companies said they had raised $3.7 billion from the sale of their holding in Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com.Prosus shares were up 10.4% at 58.62 euros by 0715 GMT on June 27. In Johannesburg, Naspers stock was up 13% at 2,165 rand.

            "description": "People walked past the Tencent booth at the China International Fair for Trade in Services in Beijing on Sept. 6, 2020.Technology investor Prosus NV will tap its huge stake in China's Tencent to fund a stock buyback in itself and parent Naspers , the Dutch firm said on Monday, knocking shares in the Chinese tech giant.The move is aimed at closing a gap between the market value of Prosus/Naspers and that of the 28.9% stake in Tencent they own, which is currently worth about $136 billion.Prosus itself is currently worth less than that stake at some 109.8 billion euros ($116.2 billion).\"This will efficiently unlock immediate value for shareholders because we're selling (Tencent) shares at full value and we're buying back our stock at a considerable discount,\" CFO Basil Sgourdos said.Prosus shares, which are down 27% in the year to date, jumped 10% on the news to 58.36 euros in Amsterdam as of 0750 GMT.Shares in Naspers in Johannesburg were up 13% while shares in Tencent were down 1.5% in Hong Kong.\"We will continue to do this as long as the discount is at elevated levels,\" Prosus/Naspers CEO Bob van Dijk said of the buyback plan, underlining that the process will be gradual but there was no specific timeframe or size limit on the sales.As a rough indication, the company pointed to a maximum sale of 3-5% of the daily trade volume in Tencent shares.\"It's a big bazooka idea to address a market inefficiency but that also retains our exposure to (Tencent) one of the best companies on the globe,\" Van Dijk said.Van Dijk, the highest paid executive in the Netherlands with a pay package worth $15.8 million for the past year, did not receive one part of his bonus that had been dependent on reducing the valuation discrepancy.The share sale plan came as a surprise as Prosus had agreed not to sell further Tencent shares after selling a 2% stake worth $15 billion in 2021.Asked about it, Sgourdos said he did not think violating the lock-up pledge was a problem.\"It's something we had to consider in arriving at this decision. (But) we think that this is the right thing for our shareholders. And, you know, we have Tencent support in this decision.\"Tencent said it supports the move and expects the impact of the share sale to be \"limited\".Separately, Prosus said it had sold a $3.67 billion stake in JD.com .Prosus and Naspers shares have fallen sharply over the past year amid a tech sector sell-off and a Chinese government crackdown on tech companies.\"The sale does not have any impact on Tencent's operations or fundamentals,\" said Union Bancaire Priv\u00e9e senior analyst Vey-Sern Ling.\"It is unlikely that China's regulatory environment, which is improving, is a major consideration.\"Sgourdos said the company remained committed to China.\"We still have a very strong belief in Tencent and the Chinese economy and its ability to grow,\" he said.Investors say the complicated cross-holding structure between Prosus and Naspers has also hurt their share price.In addition to Tencent, Prosus houses all of Naspers' overseas investments in online classifieds, food delivery, fintech and education software -- though the impact of Tencent dwarfs the performance of the rest.Both companies reported a fall in trading profit from non-Tencent businesses for the full year ending March 31, as they grew sales but increased losses.\"Results were better than we expected on revenue but lower on profitability,\" said ING Bank analyst Marc Hesselink in a note.The current discount of Prosus to the value of assets it owns is 54% and at Naspers 65%, according to company-provided figures.Prosus is in talks to sell its stake in Russia's Avito, which had been valued at $6 billion before the Ukraine war.",

            "description": "On Monday, Tencent held its annual gaming conference Spark 2022, introducing 44 new gaming-related titles and projects. The event provides a useful outlook on gaming industry trends and the world-leading gaming company\u2019s future plans.Tencent is expanding its existing advantage in popular titles and mobile games while developing more expensive blockbuster projects and exploring new technologies.As the largest gaming company in China and the second-largest in the world after Microsoft by market cap, Tencent\u2019s domestic gaming business is plateauing while its overseas gaming business continues to grow.Tencent\u2019s financial results for the first quarter this year showed the firm\u2019s game revenue in China decreased by 1% to RMB 33 billion ($4.9 billion) compared to the same period last year. In comparison, its international game revenue saw a 4% year-on-year growth to RMB 10.6 billion. Tencent attributed the results to an increase in revenues from games including Valorant and Clash of Clans, partly offsetting a decrease in revenues from PUBG Mobile as user spending normalized in the post-Covid period.These factors are also influencing Tencent\u2019s current thinking, as Spark demonstrated. Here are four major strategies in gaming that Tencent appears to be pursuing:Bringing proven gaming titles to mobileTencent has partnered with firms like Microsoft (in Chinese) that own popular gaming titles or series IP, repurposing existing titles for phones and tablets.The company brought the Microsoft Xbox title Age of Empires, a real-time strategy game, to mobile platforms for public testing in June (in Chinese). The firm has also revealed a plan to work with 20th Century Studios to develop a mobile game based on the sci-fi movie Avatar. At Spark 2022, Tencent also announced further expansions to its existing League of Legends universe, including a new esports-themed title, having previously launched three titles related to this game on mobile platforms.Tencent is experienced in operating mobile game titles, with stand-out successes such as Honor of Kings and PUBG Mobile in their gaming portfolio, so this move makes a lot of sense for the company. Additionally, the global mobile gaming market made up over half of the overall total gaming market in 2021, according to gaming insight firm Newzoo.Ambitions in AAA gamesOne of the most notable titles revealed at Spark was the still-in-development open-world game Code: To Jin Yong, produced by Tencent\u2019s LightSpeed Studios. This appears to be a move to marry a hugely popular yet largely untapped (in gaming terms) trove of material from one of China\u2019s most famous authors with Tencent\u2019s gaming capabilities.Since last year, Tencent has sped up attempts to establish an AAA game development studio (in Chinese), TiMi F1. At Spark 2022, Tencent also announced that it would operate Ubisoft\u2019s AAA-level title Tom Clancy\u2019s The Division 2.However, China\u2019s gaming approval body the National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA) rarely approves overseas AAA-level titles, with the organization having failed to issue any new gaming licenses for overseas titles for over a year (in Chinese). Developing its own AAA title may allow Tencent to bypass such uncertainty.Taking gaming tech into other fieldsSpark saw Tencent announce several projects where it will use its gaming prowess in new fields, ranging from scientific research to cultural heritage to tourism.One notable example was the company\u2019s confirmation that it will join a program initiated by the Institute of High Energy Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, to power satellites to explore outer space using the firm\u2019s gaming algorithms.Building universes around its most popular titlesAt Spark 2022, Tencent revealed a series of programs and new add-in gameplay options to some of its biggest operating titles, including Honor of Kings, League of Legends, and The Magic Sword.For League of Legends, Tencent has a routine to add new characters and renew the gameplays. Generally, there will be a new \u201cchampion\u201d every one or two months, and the gameplay strategies will have a significant change twice a year. Similar moves are also adopted in titles like the Honor of Kings and the mobile version of League of Legends.Additionally, Tencent will release cross-game events based on games\u2019 background stories for promotion, drawing players\u2019 attention and building a stronger connection between its titles. For example, Tencent introduced the Arcane program in late 2021 after bringing League of Legends: Wild Rift to the domestic market. Players from the desktop must download the firm\u2019s other related titles and have a try to earn awards. Tencent even partnered with Netflix to release a TV series with the same name to promote.",

            "description": "Chinese internet giant Tencent has created an \u2018extended reality\u2019 division that will develop hardware and services for the metaverse, according to news agency Reuters. The move is the latest Big Tech bid to stake a claim to the metaverse, with Meta, Microsoft, Apple and TikTok-developer ByteDance all making bets that virtual and extended reality will be the user interfaces of the future.It comes as a number of organisations, including Microsoft, Meta and Unity launch a new metaverse standards forum to improve interoperability.Analysts expect most Big Tech giants to announce metaverse strategies this year. (Photo by alvarez/iStock)Tencent\u2019s extended reality division was set up last year, insiders told Reuters, but has so far been \u201cshrouded in secrecy\u201d. The unit will eventually have 300 staff, they said, despite an ongoing cost-cutting drive at the company.Reuters reports that Tencent\u2019s extended reality division is working on a headset, marking its first venture into hardware, as well as software. One source said the division is a \u201cpassion project\u201d of Tencent founder Pony Ma, who has described the metaverse as an \u201call-real internet\u201d.The new division is led by Li Shen, chief technology officer of Tencent\u2019s games division, and will sit in the company\u2019s Interactive Entertainment group.Tencent gave an indication of its metaverse plans last November, when CEO Martin Lau told investors there are \u201cmultiple pathways\u201d into the market, including through interactive games and social networking. \u201cWe have a lot of tech and capability building blocks that will allow us to approach the metaverse opportunity,\u201d Lau said.The company has also registered more than 20 metaverse-related trademarks for its various apps inside China.Tencent\u2019s metaverse strategyTencent\u2019s investment in the metaverse is more than just a \u2018me-too\u2019 strategy, says Jared Klee, an analyst from Futurum Research. \u201cTencent has a robust track record for funding things at the early stages and seeing them through to fruition so I don\u2019t think this is just a \u2018fear of missing out\u2019 but rather a serious investment appropriate to the scale the company operates in,\u201d Klee told Tech Monitor.Tencent is the world\u2019s largest video games publisher, with hit titles including League of Legends and PUBG Underground. But it also provides enterprise IT services including cloud computing and AI, as well as financial services. Klee expects Tencent\u2019s metaverse strategy to focus first on games, but then expand into other fields.View all newsletters Sign up to our newsletters Data, insights and analysis delivered to you By The Tech Monitor team Sign up here\u201cThey likely won\u2019t see this is a standalone thing but a natural evolution from playing games, working in a hospital and other situations. The aim is likely to be how to extend existing work into the metaverse, although gaming is likely to be the first adopter.\u201dTencent\u2019s vast customer base \u2013 its WeChat social messaging app is the most widely used in the world \u2013 will bolster its metaverse ambitions, says Steven Dickens, another analyst at Futurum Research. \u201cWith WeChat and its pervasive deployment in China, the company is well-placed to take any XR technology to a huge user base.\u201dBoth Klee and Dickens are surprised by the company\u2019s venture into hardware. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced Tencent wants to be a hardware company,\u201d says Dickens. \u201cIf I were in Tencent\u2019s shoes, I\u2019d experiment with the hardware to see what the requirements are but then become hardware agnostic.\u201dBig investments in the metaverseFacebook\u2019s parent company Meta has been most vocal in its commitment to the metaverse, with founder Mark Zuckerberg effectively betting the future of the company on it, but many other tech giants have made metaverse plays. Both Apple and ByteDance, for example, are developing virtual reality headsets.So far, much of this investment relates to video games. When Microsoft acquired World of Warcraft publisher Activision Blizzard earlier this year, CEO Satya Nadella said that gaming \u201cwill play a key role in the development of metaverse platforms\u201d.A recent report by global consulting firm McKinsey predicted that global metaverse spending will reach $5trn by 2030. McKinsey surveyed consumers who are active in the metaverse, and found that 79% had made some kind of purchase in the past year. The most common form of payment was in-game purchases, with 47% of respondents.Is cooperation the future of the metaverse?Part of the promise of the metaverse is that users will be able to move their avatars, identities and other digital assets between virtual spaces. So far, however, companies have largely developed their metaverse strategies in isolation. But the prospect of interoperability in the metaverse took a step forward this week, with the founding of the Metaverse Standards Forum, which aims to develop interoperability standards for the new technology paradigm.The project's backers include Adobe, Alibaba, Autodesk, Epic Games, Huawei, IKEA, Khronos, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Qualcomm Technologies, Sony and Unity. The Forum includes existing standards bodies such as the Web3D Consortium, the World Wide Web Consortium, and the XR Association (XRA).\u201cThe metaverse will bring together diverse technologies, requiring a constellation of interoperability standards, created and maintained by many standards organisations,\u201d said Neil Trevett, president of Khronos, a consortium that develops interoperability standards for 3D graphics which is 'hosting' the Forum. \u201cThe Metaverse Standards Forum is a unique venue for coordination between standards organisations and industry, with a mission to foster the pragmatic and timely standardisation that will be essential to an open and inclusive metaverse.\"Klee expects most of the Big Tech companies to announce or start planning metaverse strategies in the coming months, due to the potential size of the market. But there is a long way to go before we are living and working in the metaverse, he adds.\u201cWe need to be realistic on timelines,\" he says. \"We are clearly on the upswing [and] we haven\u2019t gone through the downswing where we are disappointed by version one. This is real, the ball is rolling and we are seeing material investment that will set this up for success. We won\u2019t be living in the metaverse for a very long time to come.\u201d",

            "description": "As reported in the Reg and in a series of cutesy images posted by Tencent to the QQ social network, the company has moved 50 million cores to its cloud, saving $446 million to date.Applications moved over include WhatsApp rival WeChat, social network qq.com, games including Honour of Kings, and YouTube-like Tencent Video.Each service had tens or hundreds of millions of users, and the company reportedly had excess capacity across each service to deal with peak demands. In order to reduce waste, the company has been moving those applications to its own cloud.The Reg suggests Tencent has been working on a migration project since 2018. The cloud company said the move has seen savings of more than $446 million to date, with additional efficiency savings due to the design of Tencent\u2019s servers. The QQ post mentions a 50 percent utilization rate for the new infrastructure, claims bandwidth has increased 7.6 times and suggests DDOS protection has been greatly enhanced.Many other hyperscale cloud companies are on journeys to 'eat their own dogfood' and migrate legacy services to their own clouds. Google offers its own public cloud platform, but many of the company\u2019s key services \u2013 such as its search engine and YouTube \u2013 are still hosted on internal infrastructure separate from GCP. Last year the company announced plans to migrate parts of YouTube to GCP. Some services, including Google Workspace (formerly G Suite), Waze, and DeepMind all use Google Cloud infrastructureMicrosoft has been making a public effort to migrate all of its services to Azure for a number of years; almost all of its all first-party services, including Office 365, Teams, SharePoint, Xbox Live, and Bing now services run on Azure.In January 2021, Azure CTO Mark Russinovich said Mailbox storage for Exchange Online and Outlook.com were also in the process of moving to standard Azure infrastructure. The company also made efforts to move Minecraft\u2019s creator Mojang off AWS infrastructure and into Azure, and in 2019 Microsoft announced it had begun the multi-year process of moving LinkedIn onto Azure.AWS was developed as a way for Amazon employees to better access Amazon's internal compute resources, and so building cloud-native on its own infrastructure has long been a part of the wider company\u2019s DNA. The company has made case studies out of how the likes of Prime and Twitch utilize AWS infrastructure. However, the company did publicly note in 2019 how it was finally able to completely migrate away from Oracle database technology, something CEO Larry Ellison used to often make reference to during keynotes.",

            "description": "SHENZHEN, China, June 22, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Tencent is focusing not only on internal efforts to curb emissions, but also using digital technologies and capabilities to help various industries decarbonize, contributing to a global push in fighting climate change, said Xu Hao, Vice President of Sustainable Social Value at Tencent (0700.HK), at a Reuters online event on June 22nd.Tencent Carbon Neutrality Key Initiatives\"At Tencent, we take climate change as one of the key strategic issues for the company. On one side, we are committed to achieving net zero as soon as we can. On the other side, we are also dedicated to helping other industries decarbonize, leveraging Tencent's technology and other capabilities\", said Xu, during a panel discussion with Carbon Tracker Initiative founder Mark Campanale, and DBS's Chief Sustainability Officer, Helge Muenkel.As one of the major Chinese Internet companies at the forefront of environmental trends, Tencent has pledged to achieve carbon neutrality in its own operations and supply chain, and to use green power for 100% of all electricity consumed by 2030.According to Tencent's Carbon Neutrality Target and Roadmap Report announced earlier this year, the leading Chinese internet company's total greenhouse gas emissions and composition in the baseline year of 2021 was 5.111 million tons, roughly equal to the annual emissions of a medium-sized thermal power plant.\"Given that baseline, we planned our net zero journey following three principles. Firstly, we're going to reduce as much as we can. We did a lot of things around energy efficiency of our data centers and of our office buildings. Secondly, we will try to avoid any emissions that we may have. And lastly, we will use carbon offsets to reduce our emissions, with the lowest priority after reduction and avoidance\", said Xu.Even before Tencent announced its net-zero roadmap, the company had already long been promoting internal emissions cuts. Several of Tencent's buildings obtained LEED Gold certification. The roof of the Tencent Binhai Building in Shenzhen and the surrounding paving stones consist of water-absorbing sponge bricks to help recycle and reuse rainwater, thereby reducing the consumption of tap water for plant life and restrooms. In addition, the orientation, curtain wall and shutters of the building are specially designed to maximize the use of natural light and reduce the power consumption of internal lighting. By implementing energy-efficiency measures such as optimizing air conditioning controls, in 2020 the Binhai Building saved 5.98 GWh of electricity and reduced emissions by the equivalent of about 2,690 tons of carbon dioxide, compared with 2019.Tencent developed its fourth-generation T-Block technology for data centers, lowering Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) to as little as 1.06. The company also implemented emerging technologies such as natural cooling, liquid cooling, tri-generation, water-heat recovery and AI algorithms to boost cooling efficiency and reduce the power consumption of its data centers, a leading source of carbon emissions from internet technology companies. Rooftop solar cells were also installed at data centers. To date, more than 80 MW of distributed new energy projects are either in operation or under construction, and the annual power output of these projects after completion is expected to exceed 80 GWh.Tencent is also an active player in China's green power trading market. In 2022, the company signed sustainable power trading contracts for a total of 504 GWh, meaning the actual transaction volume of mid- and long-term agreements in several of its large data centers accounts for 43.5% of their annual electricity consumption. Among them, Tencent Qingcheng Data Center in Guangdong uses renewable energy for 100% of its annual electricity needs. Tencent is also exploring centralized renewable-energy power plants, with a focus on onshore wind and solar technologies, as well as emerging power-generation methods such as offshore wind power.Building Awareness, Facilitating TransformationIn addition to achieving its own carbon-neutrality goals, Tencent also aims to assist in the low-carbon transformation of society and support emerging low-carbon technologies, leading initiatives as a helper and connecter.\"We think awareness and capability building is quite important in terms of carbon reduction. Climate change is an issue that everybody needs to participate. From our perspective, we already have this platform that can link us with many customers,\" said Xu.Tencent is deeply rooted in the consumer internet and has many internet products that are familiar to Chinese consumers and beyond. Its business ecosystem connects massive numbers of consumers, whose choices directly or indirectly affect the carbon neutrality of society as a whole. Based on this wide reach, Tencent realized that it has the responsibility to advocate for a new low-carbon lifestyle. To this end, the company launched a series of internet products that seek to simplify the complex and specialized topic of carbon neutrality, introducing the concept of a low carbon lifestyle through lively and entertaining content.Its WeChat platform actively promoted emissions cuts and a low-carbon lifestyle through popularizing digital payments in various scenarios across China, including cable fees, metro tickets, gas stations and hospital payments, as well as online donations, therefore significantly reducing paper consumption. Over the past 5 years, reduced paper consumption due to an increase in digital transactions through WeChat has resulted in a total reduction of 188,200 tons of carbon emissions.In 2021, Tencent partnered with the Publicity and Education Center of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment to launch a carbon neutrality Q&A mini program on WeChat, helping users learn about carbon neutrality and contribute to related charities while participating. Each time they answer a question correctly, the Tencent Charity Foundation makes a donation to support programs that protect grasslands and forests. As of January 2022, 7.7 million users have taken part in the mini quiz in the program.The interactivity and immersion of games, one of Tencent's core businesses, make them an effective tool to spread low-carbon awareness and educate the public. This year, Tencent launched a charity game called Carbon Island that simulates a city's progress toward net-zero, helping to raise awareness of a low-carbon lifestyle among the public. Meanwhile, Tencent Games' Timi Studio was invited by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNDP) to join the Playing for the Planet Alliance. Since 2021, the environmental protection content of Timi games has reached 110 million players, and helped spread awareness of climate challenges.\"One of the key strategic shifts of Tencent is we are looking at how Tencent can help with industries, and help the digital transformation of industries,\" said Xu,As a technology enterprise, Tencent believes it can have a large impact in the low-carbon transformation of various industries through digitalization. Companies cannot achieve low-carbon operation without efficient and convenient online office tools. In 2019, Tencent launched its Tencent Meeting/VooV video conferencing product. Since then, the product has resulted in the cumulative reduction of more than 15 million tons of carbon emissions. Along with the rapid development of digital products, demand for digital infrastructure is also increasing across society. The transition of traditional IT infrastructure to cloud computing has improved the efficiency of resource utilization and offers another potential avenue to reduce emissions. Moreover, the many measures Tencent has taken to reduce emissions at its data centers has not only aided in the progress towards carbon neutrality in its own operations and supply chain, but has also provided low-carbon computing power and helped Tencent's clients reduce their own carbon footprints.\"If we look at 10-15 years from today, I would argue that the world will be totally different, and that new technology will play an even bigger role, and we're going to accelerate the past towards a more sustainable future. By that time, hopefully, climate change is not only just a challenge, but the pathway is much clearer, and a lot of actions have already been started,\" envisioned Xu.SOURCE Tencent",

            "description": "Chinese music company TF Entertainment (Time Fengjun Entertainment) has struck deals with two China-based music streaming companies this week.The first of those companies is China\u2019s Tencent Music Entertainment (TME), which operates the QQ Music, Kugou Music, Kuwo Music, and WeSing platforms.The other is Cloud Village, which operates TME rival NetEase Cloud Music (NCM).Established in 2009, TF Entertainment is a prominent Beijing-based entertainment company that counts popular idol groups like TFBOYS and seven-member boy group Teens in Times amongst its roster of acts.Cloud Village says that it\u2019s signed a music licensing agreement with TF Entertainment, which authorizes the music streaming platform \u201cto use a wide range of TF Entertainment\u2019s catalog\u201d.According to TME\u2019s announcement, Tencent Music Entertainment Group is renewing its strategic partnership with TF, with its own deal enabling TME users to \u201chave instant access to music from TF Entertainment\u2019s artists 30 days before all other audio streaming platforms in China\u201d.TME says in a media statement that it has been \u201csupporting the careers of TF Entertainment musicians and helping them achieve success with robust capabilities in content creation, coupled with ample promotion resources\u201d.TME adds that TF Entertainment\u2019s artists, like TFBOYS, Teens in Times and TF Family all \u201cenjoy great popularity on TME\u2019s QQ Music, Kugou Music, Kuwo Music, and WeSing platforms\u201d.NetEase Cloud Music also touts the success of TF\u2019s artists on its own platform noting in its press statement that the TFBOYS Daylight Travel 7th Anniversary Concert held on its platform in August 2020 attracted 786,000 peak concurrent viewers, and claims to have set the record for \u201cthe most live viewers for a pay per view music concert on a bespoke platform\u201d.The 30-day exclusivity window for TF Entertainment releases on Tencent Music\u2019s platforms comes nearly a year after TME and and its majority-owner Tencent Holdings were ordered to relinquish exclusive deals held with global labels in China.TME was investigated, in 2019, for striking exclusive licensing deals with the three major record companies in the territory.As part of the ban, the company was permitted to keep its exclusive deals with independent artists, with a time limit of three years for such agreements and, according to a statement issued at the time, new songs, as long as the exclusive window is no longer than 30 days.According to Tencent\u2019s announcement from August 2021, the company gave up the right to exclusive deals with relevant music copyright holders \u201cexcept for the case where the exclusive cooperation period with independent musicians does not exceed three years, and the exclusive release period of new songs does not exceed 30 days\u201d.Within TME\u2019s press materials announcing its deal with TF Entertainment, the company claims to have \u201cbecome the audio streaming platform where many of the world\u2019s top record labels first release their new music in China\u201d.Tencent Music Entertainment previously inked deals with Universal Music, Sony Music and Warner Music, and these agreements enabled it to license the music from the majors for its own platforms, in addition to exclusively sub-licensing these catalogs to local rivals.TME inked its latest licensing agreements with Universal and Warner in the past two years without an exclusive sub-licensing right, allowing these companies to strike separate direct deals with rival companies in China, including TME\u2019s main competitor, NetEase Cloud Music.Last month, MBW reported that Tencent Music and NetEase Cloud Music both added more paying music users than Spotify in Q1.NCM recently sued Tencent Music Entertainment in China alleging \u201cunfair competition\u201d, including copying elements of its app\u2019s design by TME\u2019s music services including Kuwo Music and Kugou Music.Music Business Worldwide",

The existing Tencent News app will not be affected by that move, which was described as part of regular \"business adjustments\" by operator Tencent, which runs the world's largest video gaming business by revenue and China's biggest social media platform via super app WeChat.Kuai Bao users are encouraged to take screenshots or save links to record their collection, historical data and the list of accounts they follow, according to the statement.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

In terms of daily active users, China's online news information industry is led by ByteDance's Jinri Toutiao, followed by Tencent News, Sina News and NetEase News, according to a report by research firm Questmobile in February 2021.Within the Tencent universe, many of WeChat's users choose to share news articles through the multipurpose app, rather than read them via the company's news services.Last year, Kuai Bao was among 129 apps ordered by China's internet watchdog to halt privacy infringement and rectify their user data collection practices. Other news apps named and shamed by the Cyberspace Administration of China included Jinri Toutiao, Tencent News and Sohu News.A major internet peer of Tencent has also been streamlining its operations amid regulatory scrutiny and the economic slowdown. TikTok owner ByteDance last week shut down a game development studio that it acquired three years ago, slashing more than a hundred jobs in a major setback for its quest to challenge Tencent in that market.Over the past year, ByteDance has shut down most of its online tutoring operations. The Beijing-based tech unicorn then announced a sweeping corporate restructuring last November. In December, its social networking platform Feiliao was taken offline, months after the instant messenger was relaunched as a Clubhouse-like audio social app.ByteDance then sold its loss-making securities unit Beijing Wenxing Online Technology Co in February, soon after closing the operations of fashion retail app Dmonstudio.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

The Chinese tech colossus bought the stakes through its European subsidiary, official documents revealed. With newly-acquired stakes, Tencent became the shareholder in another company that operates in India. It is, however, notable that Flipkart is a Singapore-based company.advertisementBansal, who co-founded Flipkart with Sachin Bansal, resigned back in 2018 following an investigation into an allegation against him. But he continued to be on the board of Flipkart, as well as a shareholder. Back when he quit Flipkart, his shares in the company were worth $700-800 million and he was contracted to stay on at Flipkart till 2020.Official documents revealed that the purchase of stakes happened on October 26, 2021, and the details were shared with the government authorities at the beginning of the current financial year. After selling a chunk of his stakes, Bansal now owns 1.84 per cent in Flipkart, while Tencent Cloud Europe BV - a subsidiary of Shenzhen, China-headquartered Tencent Holdings - now owns a 0.72 per cent stake in one of India's leading online shopping platforms.Tencent's share is worth $264 million, or around Rs 2,065 crore, per Flipkart's last valuation that it disclosed in July last year. Last year, Flipkart reported a surge in its worth to $37.6 billion after raising $3.6 billion (approximately Rs 26,805.6 crore) in a funding round led by Singapore's GIC, CPP Investments, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, and Walmart. Walmart owns Flipkart with a majority stake.The latest development puts Tencent in the spotlight. Despite being a Singapore-headquartered company, Flipkart operates only in India, so much so that many believe it is an Indian company. Being a Chinese company, Tencent recently had to face several blockades for its services and apps in India in the wake of the anti-China sentiment prevalent in the country. Popular games such as PUBG Mobile and PUBG Mobile Lite were banned in India in 2020.According to BusinessWorld, the transaction took place in Singapore, but the Indian government was informed about it since Flipkart considers itself \"a responsible entity.\" The transaction does not fall under the purview of India's \"Press Note 3\", which involves scrutiny of investment that an India-registered company receives from countries that share its land border with India.",

            "description": "Chinese giant Tencent is bringing its flagship title to global markets as it attempts to offset the increasing restrictions and limited growth of its home market.The company announced Honor of Kings will be \"rolling out... to global gamers by the end of the year\" via Level Infinite, the publishing label Tencent established back in December.There will be closed beta tests in the coming months, starting in July.The news comes as the South China Morning Post reports that Tencent has once again been left out of the latest wave of regulator approvals for publishing licences.The Chinese government mandates that all titles released in the market require a publishing licence, although regulators froze the approvals process for nine months -- the second time this has occurred.A first batch of 45 games were approved for release in April, with another 60 granted a licence on Tuesday. The latter included Keqier Frontier, a new title from Genshin Impact developer MiHoYo, and Perfect World Games' Black Cat Anecdote Society.The approval of just 105 games so far this year is a marked decline when compared to 2017, where regulators approved more than 9,000 games for release in China over the course of the year.None of the approval games were submitted by Tencent or its rival NetEase. Both companies have been waiting 11 months for any of their upcoming games to be given the green light.In its most recent financial results, Tencent reported revenues from domestic games, led by Honor of Kings, dipped 1% to $4.9 billion. These account for 24% of the internet firm's total quarterly revenues.However, the company saw 4% growth in revenues from games outside China at $1.6 billion -- 8% of total quarterly revenues. Tencent no doubt hopes to boost this further and offset the limitations of its home market by bringing its top title to global markets.This is not the first time the company has attempted this, though. In 2017, Tencent launched Arena of Valor, an international edition of Honor of Kings, with the aim of recreating its success overseas and taking on Western hits like League of Legends (developed by Riot Games, which is wholly owned by Tencent).The game generated $15 million in its first year, although struggled to gain traction -- to the point where there were reports Tencent were planning to give up on the game just one year later.Writing for GamesIndustry.biz in 2018, Mintegral's Jeff Sue explored why Arena of Valor struggled in America.This is also not Tencent's first attempt to establish the Honor of Kings brand outside China. Back in November, the company announced its TiMi Studios Group is working on Honor of Kings: World, a AAA spin-off for consoles and PC.The lack of new publishing licences for its domestic games is one of many challenges Tencent faces in its home market. The Chinese government has introduced several restrictions on gaming over the past year, including limiting young people to just three hours of play time per week for online games (one hour per day, Friday to Sunday).Tencent specifically attributed the dip in domestic games revenues to the \"direct and indirect effects\" of these measures.The publisher has been working hard over the years to comply with and even get ahead of such restrictions, introducing its time limits and ID checks for young players.",

REUTERS/Florence Lo Acquire Licensing RightsHONG KONG, June 7 (Reuters) - China's gaming regulator on Tuesday granted publishing licenses to 60 games, in a move likely to bring relief to a sector bruised by a regulatory crackdown and a lengthy suspension of gaming approvals.The National Press and Public Administration (NPPA) published the June list on its website on Tuesday, which included titles belonging to developers such as Perfect World (002624.SZ) and Mihoyo.Other titles included mostly smaller-budget games such as Jurassic Army by Shanghai Eyugame and Kittens' Courtyard by Beijing Object Online Technology.The list, however, did not contain titles belonging to the industry's biggest players, such as Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) and NetEase (9999.HK). Still, Tencent\u2019s American Depository Receipts gained more than 1.54% following the news. NetEase also saw shares rise nearly 1.35% in pre-market trading in New York.It also did not include any foreign titles, extending the dry spell for imported video games to 12 months.The June list comes over a month after the last batch of licenses was announced on April 30. The NPPA did not publish a list in May, and has not given a reason why.Prior to April, Chinese regulators stopped approving game monetisation licenses for nearly eight months, heavily impacting Tencent and NetEase and putting thousands of firms in the industry out of business.That pause coincided with a move by China in August to impose new gaming time limits on under-18s, an intervention it said was needed to pull the plug on a growing addiction to what state media once described as \"spiritual opium\".Reporting by Josh Ye, Meg Shen and Twinnie Siu Editing by Jason Neely and Mark PotterOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "description": "Chinese regulators released a list of 60 newly approved domestic titles (in Chinese) on Tuesday after another approval pause in May, including titles from notable gaming firms like HoYoverse (formerly known as miHoYo) and Perfect World. In April, the regulators resumed approving new games for the first time in eight months.Why it matters: China\u2019s National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA) usually releases a list of approved gaming titles monthly. With no games approved for May, gaming firms seeking to bring new titles online continue to face uncertainty.Details: The NPPA, China\u2019s government department for publishing news, films, and games, gave licenses to 60 new games in June.58 of the 60 listed titles are for mobile platforms (including tablets). The other two are a web game and a client game targeted mainly at desktop users. In comparison, 40 of the 45 approved titles in April were made for mobile platforms.The list also didn\u2019t include any titles for console platforms like Xbox, Playstation, and the Nintendo Switch.A new title from HoYoverse, developer of the globally popular game Genshin Impact, was approved for June. In addition, Perfect World, the operator of Dota 2 on the Chinese mainland, received a license for an Otome game, a story-based game targeted at women.Of the titles approved, 16 are designated as being in the \u201cbeta\u201d phase, indicating that a new policy issued last August that allows local governments to approve games in the beta phase has come into effect.Context: The NPPA\u2019s eight-month halt on the issuance of new gaming licenses had major ramifications for the gaming industry in China, causing a sharp decline in the growth rate of the industry, as well as the downsizing of major players in China\u2019s gaming sector.As a result of this uncertainty and stricter policies around teenage gamers in China, gaming companies like Tencent and NetEase began more aggressive expansion overseas as their local business slowed.There are still no signs of relief for overseas titles in China to get approvals; the last batch to be licensed was June 2021.",

            "description": "Paramount Pictures' restoration of the Taiwanese and Japanese flags on Tom Cruise's iconic aviation jacket featured in the latest Top Gun: Maverick movie has drawn mixed reactions - joy from Taiwanese viewers and anger from Chinese netizens. This comes days after Tencent Holdings withdrew its investment in the film late last month. Media outlets including The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post previously reported that Tencent pulled out of the US$170 million production after the company got concerned that its affiliation with a pro-US military movie would anger Beijing.In the 2019 version of the trailer, the Taiwanese flag was either missing or could not be seen properly. This led to speculation about whether the flag was removed to \"satisfy demands from China's censors\", Bloomberg reported. The jacket was worn by Cruise's character in the movie as a tribute to his late father. The Taiwanese flag, along with the Japanese one, served as a reference to his late father's service on the USS Galveston CLG-3 cruiser in the Pacific Ocean in the movie, Bloomberg explained.When the film was shown during an advance screening, however, the flag appeared on Cruise's jacket, leading to applause in cinemas, Bloomberg and Taiwanese media outlet SETN reported. On the other hand, Chinese netizens were angered by this move. According to Taiwan News, an English-language portal for news about Taiwan, one Chinese netizen said audiences in China can just watch pirated copies instead while another commented that the Chinese market wouldn't want anything to do with Cruise in future.There have long been tensions between Beijing and Taiwan, with military conflicts over the decades and travel and communication largely cut off. Authorities in Beijing believe Taiwan to be part of its territory and the Taiwanese flag is considered an independence symbol. Meanwhile, Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen and her government have stressed that Taiwan is \"already a de facto independent nation\" that requires wider global recognition, Bloomberg said.The US also recently ruffled China's feathers after president Joe Biden said last month that it will intervene militarily to protect Taiwan if the island is attack. According to BBC, Biden also said China is \"flirting with danger\" over Taiwan. In response, Beijing said there is \"no room for compromise or concession\" because Taiwan is \"an inalienable part of China's territory\". It also urged US to abide by the One China principle.Related articles:Top Gun: Maverick lands in KL via adrenaline-pumping 3D displayRSAF jets off with timely adrenaline-pumping Top Gun-like ad",

Str | Afp | Getty ImagesBEIJING \u2014 Chinese tech giants Alibaba , Tencent and JD.com have all posted their slowest revenue growth on record as Covid and Beijing's tech crackdown took their toll. Since the fall of 2020, China has fined corporations and scrutinized them for alleged monopolistic practices. A Covid resurgence since March has added pressure to growth, with travel restrictions and stay-home orders disrupting supply chains and logistics. Reflecting the economic slowdown, e-commerce giant Alibaba reported on Thursday a drop in online shopping for its two main China platforms in the quarter ended March 31. The company's total revenue rose by 9% in the latest quarter from a year ago \u2014 the slowest on record, according to financial history accessed through Wind Information. Tencent's revenue for the quarter was little changed, while JD.com saw a roughly 18% increase from a year ago \u2014 both the slowest on record, according to Wind data. Alibaba shares soared by nearly 15% in New York trading overnight after reporting better-than-expected results. JD.com's U.S.-listed shares rose by 5%, while Tencent's climbed more than 1% in Hong Kong trading Friday.China's consumer demand\"Macro-sensitive stocks\" such as Alibaba and Baidu might temporarily benefit from low earnings expectations, and anticipation that Shanghai is close to ending its lockdown, Jialong Shi and Thomas Shen, analysts at Nomura, said in a note Friday. \"However, we believe the sustainability of this rally will likely be dictated by the pace of recovery for China consumer demand, which the market will likely closely follow over the coming months,\" the analysts said. China's already sluggish retail sales fell further in April, down 11.1% from a year ago. Even online sales of physical goods fell, down by 1% \u2014 worse than during the initial shock of the pandemic in 2020. That's according to CNBC calculations of official data accessed through Wind Information.watch nowThe Nomura analysts said many businesses were deciding to cut marketing spending as a way to ride out the difficult environment, \"which might lead to a belated recovery in the ads industry even if China is completely out of the lockdown mode.\" Alibaba said excluding unpaid orders, gross merchandise value (GMV) saw a \"low single-digit decline\" from a year ago, according to an earnings call transcript from FactSet. GMV is a measure of goods sold over a set period of time. The company said its online physical goods GMV in China, excluding unpaid orders, fell further in April, with a \"low teens\" decline from a year ago. The company said more than 80 cities in China \u2014 mostly national economic centers \u2014 reported confirmed Covid cases in April. That represents more than half of Alibaba's China retail marketplace GMV. For the April to June quarter, China Renaissance analysts said in a report they expect Alibaba's China commerce GMV to drop by 13.5% year-on-year, for a 6% decline in overall net revenue.Bright spotsOther Chinese companies reporting results for the latest quarter painted a more upbeat picture. Baidu: Chinese tech company Baidu's mild 1% quarterly revenue increase was only the worst since 2020, a year that saw two quarters of revenue decline, Wind data showed. The search engine giant has expanded in recent years into cloud services and robotaxis. \"We see solid progress in its various AI initiatives,\" Daiwa Capital Markets analysts wrote in a report Thursday. They noted Baidu's AI cloud revenue grew by 45% year-on-year in the first quarter, faster than the company's peers. Dada: Grocery delivery company Dada , which is now majority-owned by JD, reported a 21% year-on-year revenue increase in the latest quarter, the best since the third quarter of 2021, according to Wind. Dada said it was one of the businesses local government approved to maintain operations during lockdowns. The company reported more than triple the GMV and double the number of active customers in the 12 months ended late March, versus the same period two years ago.",

Part of the collaboration is said to include features such as infotainment, autonomous driving and connectivity for the automaker\u2019s upcoming EV cars. In this way, Audi hopes to make its vehicles more attractive to Chinese customers, especially younger buyers. Giorgio Delucchi, Audi\u2019s head of sales for China and Hong Kong, said the company aims to incorporate only the latest technologies in its soon-to-be-released EVs. The carmaker is working with Alibaba Group Holding, Baidu and Tecent Holding on Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT) and urban mobility. Delucchi said in an interview that he wants to ensure Audi is at the forefront of technical cooperation and development with its Chinese partners. Infotainment, autonomous driving and connectivity functions are key areas that Audi needs to tap into in order to stay ahead of the competition in the Chinese market, the sales executive added. Vehicles and components must be awarded a CCC certificate in order to export the products to China or trade them locally.For Audi, as the leading brand in China for luxury vehicles for three decades, the electrification of vehicle models in the world\u2019s largest car market has only just begun. Tesla and Chinese start-ups such as Xpeng, NIO and Li Auto are entering the EV market as serious competitors. Their target group, young drivers, has a preference for intelligent vehicle features such as driver assistance systems, voice recognition and large displays in the vehicles. The aforementioned three Chinese start-ups, with more than 10,000 EVs delivered in November, have the potential to drastically reduce Tesla\u2019s market share, according to experts. Audi, as the luxury car brand of the Volkswagen Group, does not report separate sales figures for their EVs in China, but is estimated to be far behind Tesla and the local start-ups. Tian Maowei, sales manager at a major car dealer in Shanghai, agrees: \u201cIn today\u2019s e-vehicle market, customers are more interested in automatic functions and range.\u201d Maowei adds: \u201cMercedes, BMW and Audi are popular brands for cars with combustion engines. However, they need to adapt their EV strategy respectively models for the Chinese market to attract customers here as well.\u201dCCC certification for automotive products is a complex project that requires professional support at all stages.

            "description": "SHANGHAI, May 23 (Reuters) - Pony Ma, the low-profile founder of tech giant Tencent Holdings, created a social media stir over the weekend by reposting an article on China's economy, an unusual breaking of silence by a Chinese tech mogul on an increasingly sensitive topic.The article, which Ma reposted early on Saturday, lamented that there were few people in China willing to speak up about the pressures facing the country's economy and businesses.Screenshots of Ma's post on his WeChat \"moments\" feed went viral on the Twitter-like Weibo, where searches surged for his Chinese name, Ma Huateng. Many comments took the repost as an expression of frustration.Tencent did not respond to a request for comment.Two people with knowledge of Ma's WeChat moments feed told Reuters that the post was authentic. The feed would only be visible to contacts approved by Ma. WeChat is owned by Tencent (0700.HK).Ma's only comment on the article highlighted a line in which its author, Zhang Mingyang, said young social media users were \"anti-capitalist\" and embraced double standards.\"The way some netizens care about the economy is: Firms can go bankrupt, but they cannot fire staff; firms can go bankrupt, but they cannot have overtime work,\" the article said. \"Of course if they order delivery and it's late by 10 minutes, they will curse, and will scold the delivery rider harsher than anyone else\".Ma commented on that passage: \"The description in this paragraph is very vivid.\"In the past couple years, Chinese tech company founders have avoided posting on social media or making comments that could be perceived as critical of government policy, reflecting a broader trend of tightening censorship, and self-censorship, in China.Beijing, meanwhile, has become particularly sensitive to suggestions that its strict policies to contain COVID-19 outbreaks may be excessive given their harm to the economy.\"Ma Huateng finally spoke out about how the economy is developing! Really, everyone is very concerned about the economy but there's nothing we can do about it!\" said one Weibo user. \"Now the whole society has fallen into collective silence.\"Sensitivities are also heightened ahead of a ruling Communist Party meeting late this year when President Xi Jinping is widely expected to secure a precedent-breaking third leadership term.Some tech tycoons have come under pressure in the past for expressing criticism or publishing commentary interpreted as critical, amid a nearly two-year regulatory crackdown that has hit most of the sector's biggest names.Alibaba founder Jack Ma in late 2020 delivered a speech criticising China's financial regulators. That was followed by a chain of events resulting in the shelving of his Ant Group's huge IPO.Shares in Meituan (3690.HK) slumped last year after founder Wang Xing posted an ancient poem on the Fanfou social media platform that was perceived by some on social media as critical of the government and Xi.Tencent has come under pressure both from both investors, who want it to deliver on earnings, and from local media over employee layoffs. Last week, the company reported its quarterly profit halved from a year ago and revenues stagnated. read moreTencent investors did not seem worried by Ma's post.

            "description": "At a glance:Q1 revenues flat at $21.3 billion, profits down 52%Domestic titles still generate bulk of games revenue, but performance from international titles up 4%Tencent believes game approvals in China will remain slower than prior to 2018 freezeChinese internet giant Tencent has released its financial results for the first quarter of the year, with revenues flat but profits declining.For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the company reported total revenues of RMB 135.5 billion ($21.3 billion) -- roughly in line with the RMB 135.3 billion ($20.2 billion) reported in Q1 2021.The company first detailed results on an non-IFRS [International Financial Reporting Standards] basis in order to show core earnings without one-time expenses or non-cash items skewing the figures.On this basis, operating profit was down 15% year-on-year to RMB 36.5 billion ($5.8 billion. Operating margin decreased from 32% in Q1 2021 to 27%.Profit was reported as RMB 26.3 billion ($4.1 billion), down 24% year-on-year, with the net margin falling from 26% to 19%.On an IFRS basis, these figures were a little different.Operating profit dropped 34% to RMB 37.2 billion ($5.9 billion), with operating margin down from 42% to 27%.Profit fell 52% from RMB 23.7 billion ($3.7 billion), with net margin at 18%, down from 36%.Looking specifically at its video games business, revenues from domestic titles (i.e. those in Tencent's home market of China) dip ever so slightly by 1% to RMB 33 billion ($4.9 billion).This was attributed to the \"direct and indirect effects\" of measures implemented in China to protect minors from excessive gaming. Last year, the Chinese government introduced spending caps and ruled that young people could only play online games for three hours a week (one hour per day, Friday to Sunday).Tencent saw a surge in revenues for newly launched games League of Legends: Wild Rift and Fight of The Golden Spatula, but these were offset in declines see from Call of Duty Mobile, Moonlight Blade Mobile and other titles.Outside of China, games revenues rose 4% year-on-year to RMB 10.6 billion ($1.6 billion), thanks to improved performances from Valorant and Clash of Clans. However, Tencent reported a decline in revenues from PUBG Mobile \"as user spending normalised post-COVID.\"Domestic games accounted for 24% of the company's total quarterly revenues, slightly down from 25% in Q1 2021. Meanwhile, international games accounted for 8%, up from 7%.During an earnings call, transcribed by Seeking Alpha, investors asked the company about the government recently lifting the latest freeze on new game approvals -- and the fact no Tencent titles were included in the first wave.Chief strategy officer James Mitchell said the opening of the approval process was positive as it means more games can be published, adding that smaller companies are hurt more by the freeze so it's \"very rational\" for regulators to begin with their titles.But he expects regulators to still be strict on how many games they allow into the market.\"We believe that generally speaking there will be fewer game approvals in the future than there were in the pre-2018 period,\" he told investors.\"It's a big part of the reason why in the last two years we've reconfigured our game business from top to bottom to focus on releasing and usually developing fewer, bigger budget and hopefully better games. And we think that we have been -- we are really a pioneer in the industry in terms of doing that.\"",

He cited a meeting on Tuesday where Chinese Vice Premier Liu He assured tech firms of the authorities\u2019s support for the sector. read more\u201cSo you can see that from the senior most level, there is a pretty clear supportive signal released,\" he said, adding it would take time before its will translate into a real impact on the company's business.Lau also added that while stricter regulations could become \"normal practices\", COVID outbreaks had emerged as a bigger challenge.James Mitchell, Tencent\u2019s chief strategy officer, said that the prolonged COVID-19 lockdown in Shanghai, in particular, had significantly hampered multinational corporations\u2019 advertising budgets as many tended to make their advertising decisions out of the city.A logo of Tencent is seen during the World Internet Conference (WIC) in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, China, November 23, 2020. REUTERS/Aly Song/ Acquire Licensing RightsStill, regulatory curbs have hurt many of Tencent\u2019s revenue engines including video games. After freezing new game licences for 8 months, Beijing resumed issuing licenses in April but the latest batch of new licenses did not include games from Tencent, which makes much of its money by developing games such as 'Honour of Kings' and 'Call of Duty Mobile'.China has yet to issue more game licences this month.Mitchell said he expected big firms like Tencent to receive game licenses in the future but that China will approve fewer games overall going forward. To account for that, Tencent has pivoted to focus on fewer but higher-quality games, and plans to introduce more big-budget games in 2023, he added.Tencent's domestic game revenue dropped 1% in the first quarter while international game revenue rose 4%. With Chinese regulators imposing draconian measures to keep minors from playing video games and curbing aggressive monetization features, Tencent has turned to overseas markets for growth.Revenue growth in its fintech and business services segment slowed to 10% in the first quarter, from 47% a year earlier.Total revenue was 135.5 billion yuan ($20 billion) in the quarter, roughly the same as a year earlier, and below analysts' average 141 billion yuan estimate, according to Refinitiv.Shawn Yang, Shenzhen-based managing director of Blue Lotus Capital Advisors, said the 51% plunge in quarterly profit was particularly concerning.\"I estimated a 17% or 18% decrease because I had learned that they had executed many cost-cutting measures,\" Yang said. \"I couldn't guess that its profit has gotten this bad.\"($1 = 6.7488 Chinese yuan renminbi)(This story refiles to fix typo in paragraph 8)Reporting by Josh Ye; Editing by Kim Coghill, Bernadette Baum and Tomasz JanowskiOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

China's Tencent reported on Wednesday its quarterly profit halved from a year ago and revenues stagnated, blaming cuts in advertising spending by consumer, e-commerce and travel businesses for its worst performance since it went public in 2004. Qilai Shen | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBEIJING \u2014 Chinese tech giant Tencent reported disappointing first quarter revenue across all major business segments, including a hit to mobile pay from Covid lockdowns. Shares of Tencent, the largest Hong Kong-listed Chinese stock by market value, traded nearly 7% lower Thursday, pulling down the broader Hang Seng index. Fintech and business services revenue, the company's second-largest revenue driver, dropped by 10.8% quarter-on-quarter in the period ended March 31 to 42.77 billion yuan ($6.29 billion). That's the first sequential drop since an 11.5% decline from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the first three months of 2020, according to Wind Information data. China's GDP contracted in the first three months of 2020 as Covid lockdowns were imposed across more than half of mainland China in the early part of the year. Since March, the country has attempted to control its worst resurgence of the virus in two years by using travel restrictions and targeted stay-home orders.Loading chart...\"Commercial payment activities have been weak since mid-March 2022, due to the resurgence of COVID-19 in several cities in China,\" Tencent said in an earnings release Wednesday. That \"negatively affected payment volume growth in categories such as transportation, dining services and apparel,\" the company said. Management said during the analysts' call that volume fell year-on-year for many weeks in Shanghai, and has not yet improved to normal levels, according to a transcript accessed through Refinitiv Eikon. Tencent operates WeChat, one of China's two dominant mobile payment apps. WeChat, known domestically as Weixin, is also the prevailing messaging and social network platform in China. Tencent is trying to build up a short-video and e-commerce business within the app. Monthly active users of WeChat domestically and internationally rose by 3.8% from a year ago to 1.29 billion users.watch nowOn a year-on-year basis, fintech services revenue grew at a moderated pace, while business services declined, Tencent said, without disclosing specific figures. The overall fintech and business services segment grew by 10% from a year ago. But that missed FactSet estimates by 3.41 billion yuan and marked a sharp slowdown from a 25% increase in the fourth quarter of 2021. Tencent's first quarter revenue across all business segments fell by 0.12% from a year ago to 135.47 billion yuan \u2014 also coming in below FactSet estimates for 140.82 billion yuan. Profit attributable to shareholders plunged by 23% from a year ago. The business segment that includes gaming, Tencent's biggest source of revenue, generated a disappointing 72.74 billion yuan in first quarter revenue, up mildly from the prior quarter and the year-ago period. That reflected challenges from Beijing's restrictions on licensing new games and a slowdown in the international market. Tencent owns popular online games such as League of Legends and Honor of Kings.Forthcoming regulatory supportThe company said they expect to receive game licenses in the future but that China would approve fewer games overall. Looking ahead, China Renaissance analysts forecast online game revenue could drop by 0.3% year-on-year in the second quarter, and predicted a full-year increase of only 0.1%. Beijing has cracked down not only on gaming but alleged monopolistic practices of the country's internet giants. Authorities have struck a more moderate tone in recent months, calling instead for \"healthy\" development of the so-called platform economy and increased digitalization of the economy. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He this week gave some of the latest high-level assurances to the tech sector. Tencent President Martin Lau cited Liu's comments in an earnings call Wednesday. \"So we can clearly see that from the senior-most level, there is a pretty clear supportive signals released,\" Lau said, noting it would take time for implementation.",

Total revenue was RMB 135 billion, largely stable year on year or down 6% quarter on quarter.Gross profit was RMB 57 billion, down 9% year on year and 1% quarter on quarter. Non-IFRS operating profit was RMB 37 billion, down 15% year on year or up 10% quarter on quarter. Non-IFRS net profit attributable to equity holders was RMB 26 billion, down 23% year on year or up 3% quarter on quarter. For our key services, we generally retain our [Inaudible] positions in activities, including social games, long-form video, news, music, literature, payment, and mobile browser.Combined MAU of Weixin and WeChat was 1.29 billion. Mobile devices MAU of QQ was 564 million. Now I will hand over to Martin and James for the business review.Martin Lau -- PresidentThank you, Pony, and good evening and good morning to everybody. For the first quarter of 2022, our total revenue was largely stable year on year. VAS represented 54% of our total revenue, within which social networks subsegment revenue was 22%. Domestic games subsegment revenue was 24% and international games subsegment was 8%.online advertising was 13%, and FinTech and business service was 32% of total revenue. For Value-added Services, the segment revenue was RMB 73 billion for the quarter, broadly stable year on year. Social networks revenue was up 1% year on year to RMB 29 billion, reflecting increased revenue from video accounts like streaming service, which was largely offset by decreased revenue from music- and games-related live streaming services. Total VAS subscriptions grew 6% year on year to 239 million.For Tencent Video, we extended long video market leadership with 124 million subscribers. Our popular content such as drama series Sword Snow Stride and animated series Perfect World Season 2 demonstrated our strength in IP adaptation of comics and novels. Music subscriptions increased 32% year on year to 80 million, driven by high-quality content as well as increased consumer willingness to subscribe for music services. Domestic games revenue was down 1% year on year to RMB 33 billion as direct and indirect effects of minor protection measures impacted active user and paying user accounts.Recently released games, League of Legends: Wild Rift and Fight of The Golden Spatula, generated incremental revenue. While revenue from Moonlight Blade Mobile and Call of Duty Mobile decreased. International games revenue grew 4% year on year to RMB 11 billion. year on year growth was slower than in recent quarters, reflecting lower PUBG Mobile revenue as user spending normalized post-COVID industrywide as well as timing of content upgrade in League of Legends and Clash of Clans.Revenue declined sequentially from a high base in fourth quarter last year when there was a trued-up adjustment to Supercell's revenue and more consumption during the year-end holidays. With respect to Weixin, video accounts continued its strong growth momentum with significant year-on-year increase in video viewers and time spent. This was supported by expansion in news, knowledge-based, and entertainment content as well as better recommendation technologies. We also enhanced enterprise messaging and shopping features in video accounts to facilitate user engagement and monetization for creators, driving a more vibrant content ecosystem.Mini Programs exceeded 500 million DAUs and sustained rapid growth in GMV year on year, with particularly notable growth in retail and restaurant categories as we enhance the functionalities for customer services and operational analysis. With more public service such as health and municipal services available through Mini Programs, we're able to cultivate user habits in accessing essential services through Mini Programs. For QQ, we are enriching features for young users to better create, share and connect with each other. We provide avatar tools for users to create interesting short videos featuring their own customized Super QQ Show characters.Through a status update, users can share videos and music they are consuming so that their friends can access and stream the same content without leaving the QQ app via Mini Programs, enhancing social interaction and content consumption. Turning to domestic games. We extended our long-standing leadership among the highest DAU games while also penetrating new and new to Tencent game genres. In battle arena games, Honour of King's growth in receipts decreased year on year during the Chinese New Year holidays due to fewer commercially successful items.However, the game's adult user base has been stable and growth in receipts resumed year on year growth in March on more commercially successful items. Peacekeeper Elite, the No. 1 shooter game in China, enhanced its user engagement by introducing new combat items and battlefield design in its third-anniversary content update in April. Among new genres, in auto battler games, Fight of The Golden Spatula released new champions and game mechanics that enriched players' competitive experience.The game ranked No. 1 in the genre and No. 6 in all mobile games by DAU in the first quarter. It is currently the most successful new game release across the industry from 2021.In real-time strategy games, we launched Timi Studio's Return to Empire in late March. Leveraging partnership with Xbox Game Studios, the game offers high-quality graphics and contents to gamers. It was the second most revenue-generated game in the genre industrywide measured by grossing receipts in April. Moving on to international games.The mobile game industry outside of China generally experienced slower growth or declines in early 2022 versus COVID-19 impacted period in early 2021. PUBG Mobile as a result experienced year-on-year growth in receipts decline in the first quarter. However, we're confident in the game's longer-term trends as they move beyond the COVID comparisons. Spider-Man-themed PUBG game was launched in January and was successful in driving user engagement.While Lamborghini [Inaudible] released in March became the game's top-selling cars games ever. Our PC game Valorant continued its robust performance. Its growing user base, paying propensity and attractive content drove growth in receipts up significantly year on year. Valorant has become the sixth most popular PC game by MAU across all genres and is the highest ranked in new PC game title released in the last four years.Besides our existing titles, we're releasing compelling new games via partnership with globally renowned IPs. One example is Dune: Spice Wars, a realtime strategy PC game based on the sci-fi IP Dune. Published by our subsidiary studio, Funcom, the game achieved initial success since its early access launch on April 26th. Funcom, which has game rights to notable IP such as Dune and Conan the Barbarian is also developing an open world survival game based on Dune.Another example is Apex Legends Mobile, a hero shooter battle royale game jointly developed by our Lightspeed & Quantum Studios and EA's Respawn studio was launched yesterday globally. The mobile game is based on one of the most successful new PC console IPs in recent years. Looking forward, we aim to grow further our existing titles and release multiple big-budget new titles, especially from 2023 onwards. With that, I'll pass to James to talk about other businesses.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerThank you, Martin. Turning to online advertising. Revenue was CNY 18 billion in the first quarter, down 18% year on year and down 16% quarter on quarter. And subdued bidding density results in lower eCPMs.Our Social and Others Advertising revenue was CNY 16 billion, down 15% year on year and 15% quarter on quarter, within which, our mobile ad network revenue declined sharply year on year due to weak demand and regulatory changes such as restrictions on flash screen ads. Weixin Moments advertising revenue dipped slightly year on year as weakness in education and real estate ad spend outweighed growth from FMCG and games ad spend. Official accounts advertising revenue increased notably year on year as we enabled advertisers to better target young users via notification of feeds ads and to run their ads within an environment of high-quality and relevant content. Over 20% of official accounts ad revenue comes from click-to-purchase and click-to-message ads, which are powered by Mini Programs and WeCom respectively.Our media advertising revenue was CNY 2 billion, down 30% year on year and 27% quarter on quarter. Within which, our video ad revenue declined double digits year on year. The Winter Olympics and popular drama series such as The Oath of Love generated incremental video ad revenue but were more than offset by fewer releases of top-tier variety shows when compared to the first quarter of last year. For the second quarter to date, advertising categories such as FMCG, eCommerce, and travel have scaled back their spending due to the COVID situation and attended to supply chain disruptions.We continue to invest in our advertising system and are upgrading our machine learning infrastructure to process data more efficiently. The upgrade should ultimately enable us to enhance our targeting and, thus, conversion rates for advertisers. Looking at FinTech and business service. Segment revenue was CNY 43 billion, up 10% year on year and down 11% quarter on quarter.To FinTech, the year-on-year revenue growth moderated due to slower growth in commercial payment volume, reflecting multiple cities taking measures to combat the COVID-19 resurgence in March, resulting in less consumption of both everyday items such as food and beverage as well as big-ticket items such as travel booking. Our payment volume correspondingly decelerated, especially in categories such as transportation, dining services and apparel. For business services, our revenue dipped slightly year on year as we shifted our focus from prioritizing revenue growth toward customer value creation and quality of growth. We proactively scaled back certain loss-making activities, such as projects that carry substantial headline revenue but also substantial costs that we needed to pay to subcontractors as well as deeply discounted infrastructure-only contracts for basic services such as cloud compute and content delivery network.However, we've increased our healthier margin PaaS revenue, especially in video cloud and cybersecurity. The video cloud taking advantage of our accumulated experience providing in-house interactive entertainment and video chat services as well as our low latency network infrastructure. We're increasingly migrating our clients from the basic content delivery network to more sophisticated video on demand, live streaming, and realtime communication solutions. Our realtime communication service meets growing demand interactive video services in scenarios such as online meetings, customer service, and live streaming eCommerce.And Gartner ranked Tencent first among all vendors for communication PaaS revenues in China for 2021. For cybersecurity, we expanded our client base across network endpoint and business operation security solutions, fulfilling enterprises' need for protection against cyberattacks as well as for cybersecurity compliance. To position for the fast-growing demand for next-generation enterprise security, we're enhancing our Zero Trust security solutions that facilitate remote working. These Zero Trust security solutions leverage our accumulated internal experience in network security management.And I'll now pass to John.John Lo -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you, James. For the first quarter of 2022, total revenue was CNY 135.5 billion, stable year on year or down 6% quarter on quarter. Gross profit was CNY 57.1 billion, down 9% year on year or 1% quarter on quarter. Net other gains were CNY 13.1 billion, down 33% year on year or 85% quarter on quarter, which were primarily non-IFRS adjustment items, including CNY 18.5 billion gain arising from our partial divestment of Sea Limited, partly offset by impairment provisions against investee companies in verticals such as transportation services and online media.Operating profit was CNY 37.2 billion, down 34% year on year and 66% quarter on quarter. Net finance costs were CNY 1.9 billion, up 42% year on year or 4% quarter on quarter, reflecting greater interest expenses due to increased indebtedness as well as lower foreign exchange gains both year on year and quarter on quarter. Shared of losses of associates and JVs were CNY 6.3 billion, compared to share of profits of CNY 1.3 billion last year. Non-IFRS share of losses were CNY 2.2 billion, compared to non-IFRS share of profits of CNY 0.5 billion a year ago, reflecting revenue decline at certain overseas game associates due to post-COVID user spending normalization, losses recognized from associates in the transportation services verticals and the impact from JD.com ceasing to be an associate.Income tax expense decreased by 27% to CNY 5.3 billion for the first quarter of 2022 on a year-on-year basis. The effective tax rate was 18.2%. IFRS net profit attributable to equity holders was CNY 23.4 billion, down 51% year on year or 75% quarter on quarter. Diluted EPS was CNY 2.404, down 51% year on year or 75% quarter on quarter.Now I'll share with you our non-IFRS financial figures. Operating profit was CNY 36.5 billion, down 15% year on year or up 10% quarter on quarter, reflecting lower marketing expenses as a result of our cost optimization measures. Net profit attributable to equity holders was CNY 25.5 billion, down 23% year on year or up 3% quarter on quarter. Diluted EPS was CNY 2.62, down 23% year on year or up 3% quarter on quarter.Moving on to gross margin. The overall gross margin was 42.1%, down 4.2 percentage points year on year or up two percentage points quarter on quarter. The year-on-year decrease reflected the result of stable revenue with increased operating costs, mix shift toward lower-margin products and our continued investments in key strategic initiatives. The quarter-on-quarter increase was due to seasonal revenue mix shift toward high-margin businesses, such as games.By segment, gross margin for VAS was 50.4%, down 4.7 percentage points year on year or up 1.7 percentage points quarter on quarter. The year-on-year decrease reflected stable segment revenue with increased costs, including content cost for games, server and bandwidth costs in addition to our investment in strategic initiatives, in particular, video accounts. The quarter-on-quarter increase was driven by seasonal revenue mix shift toward higher-margin businesses within the segment. Gross margin for online advertising was 36.7%, down 8.4 percentage points year on year or 6 percentage points quarter on quarter.year on year decrease was due to revenue decline and increase in operating costs, including those associated with our video accounts and the content cost of Beijing Winter Olympics as well as the fact that the full exemption from cultural construction fee was no longer available this year, which was also the main reason for quarter-on-quarter decrease. Gross margin for FinTech and business service was 31.6%, broadly stable year on year or up 4.5 percentage points quarter on quarter. The quarter-on-quarter increase was driven by revenue mix shift toward higher-margin FinTech businesses within this segment as well as our recent initiatives to reduce loss-making cloud service contracts. On operating expenses.Selling and marketing expenses were CNY 8.1 billion, down 6% year on year or 31% quarter on quarter. Excluding stock-based compensation, selling and marketing expenses decreased by 7% year on year and 32% quarter on quarter. Y-on-Y decrease reflected our marketing expense optimization measures. Quarter-on-quarter decrease reflected lower marketing spending on games and business services due to both seasonality and expense optimization measures.Selling and marketing expenses were 5.9% of revenues, broadly stable year on year. R&D expenses were CNY 15.4 billion, up 36% year on year or 10% quarter on quarter. Excluding share-based compensation, R&D expenses increased by 27% year on year or 6% quarter on quarter. The year on year and quarter on quarter increases were mainly due to greater staff costs reflecting our ongoing investment in key strategic initiatives as well as the impact of recent acquisition of subsidiaries.R&D expenses were 11.4% of revenues. G&A expenses excluding R&D were CNY 11.3 billion, up 47% Y on Y or 9% Q on Q. Excluding share-based compensation, G&A expenses -- excluding R&D increased 25% year on year or decreased 7% quarter on quarter. The year-on-year increase reflected greater staff costs driven by headcount increase to support our ongoing investment in key strategic areas, greater expenses incurred by our overseas subsidiaries as well as expenses from recently acquired subsidiaries.At quarter end, we had approximately 116,000 employees, up 30% year on year or 3% quarter on quarter. Let's take a look at the operating and net margin ratios. Due to the combined reasons I mentioned earlier, non-IFRS operating margin was 27%, down 4.6 percentage points year on year or up four percentage points quarter on quarter. Non-IFRS net margin was 19.4%, down 6.1 percentage points year on year due to lower operating margin and the turning from profit to losses share from associates as a whole.Non-IFRS net margin increased by 1.5 percentage points quarter on quarter due to seasonal revenue mix shift to higher-margin businesses as well as marketing expenses optimization measures. Finally, I'll share some key financial metrics on the cash flow and balance sheet for the quarter. Total capex was CNY 7 billion, down 10% year on year or 40% quarter on quarter. Within total capex, operating capex was CNY 5.2 billion, down 21% year on year.Nonoperating capex increased by 54% year on year to CNY 1.8 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was CNY 33.8 billion, down 34% both year on year and Q on Q. year on year decline among normal working capital change was partly due to lower cash receipts from games and online advertising while our R&D and staff cost continue to grow. quarter on quarter decline was primarily due to our annual bonus payment recorded in the first quarter each year.Free cash flow for the quarter was CNY 15.2 billion, down 54% year on year and 54% -- 55% quarter on quarter. Net debt position was CNY 11 billion, compared to CNY 20.2 billion last quarter. The fair value of our shareholdings and listed investee companies, excluding subsidiaries, was approximately CNY 606 billion or $95 billion as of the end of the quarter. We repurchased approximately 8.9 million shares with about CNY 3 billion for the quarter.Thank you.Wendy Huang -- Investor Relations OfficerOperator, let's open the floor for questions now.Questions & Answers:OperatorThank you. Your first question comes from the line of Alicia Yap from Citigroup. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.Alicia Yap -- Citi -- AnalystHi. Thank you. Good evening, management. Thanks for taking my questions.My first question is that in light of the latest situation in China, so can management share with us your insight on what you have been able to observe over the past two months in terms of any change of the consumer behavior or your business partners' sentiment as related to your digital content consumption, the consumer willingness to spend and then your business partner on the online ad budget spend and also the cloud infrastructure migration timing given the latest lockdown? So how will the latest macro headwind affect your gaming, payment, advertising, or even your cloud business outlook into the second half? And then my second question is, can management elaborate a little bit on your prepared remarks related to your video-on-demand live streaming and also the real-time communication solution? So how will that -- these advanced solutions translate to a better pricing eventually that also will help you optimizing your operating costs that could potentially support future business revenue -- business service revenue growth and also the margin profile for this segment? You mentioned some customer adoption rate. Any color that you can share on this on-demand service so far? Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerAlicia, thank you for the two questions. And there are a number of sub-questions within them, but I'll try to cover up most of the topics you raised. So in terms of observations on changing consumer and enterprise sentiment, then at a high-level generalization, the behavior is very tied to the COVID situation in different cities around China. So as you're probably all aware, Shanghai has experienced a very severely unfortunate COVID outbreak.And we have seen on the consumer side that the commercial payment volume has remained below trend and down year on year for many weeks in Shanghai. The trend is gently improving now, but it's still below where it would otherwise be. On the other hand, Shenzhen provides a case study of a city that had a small-scale COVID outbreak in March and got on top of it very quickly. And if we look at the consumer commercial payment volume in Shenzhen, there was a sharp letdown in March with the lockdowns and then a fairly rapid recovery in April.And in May, the commercial payment volume is largely back to the previous trend rates and growing year on year in Shenzhen. So in terms of how will the latest macro headwind affect our businesses, it's really a question primarily of how COVID behaves in different cities across the country. Drilling into some of your sub-questions. On the digital content side then, if I were to differentiate the COVID outbreaks in 2022 versus those we previously experienced in 2020, what we saw in early 2020 was that because the COVID outbreaks happened straight after the Chinese New Year period, many people were in a patient mindset, holiday mindset, and they remained in a holiday mindset during the lockdown.And so there was a relatively fast upturn in usage of entertainment-related applications. On the other hand, it took consumers and enterprises and teachers, and students several weeks to become comfortable with productivity-related applications. This time around, the COVID outbreak happened several weeks after the Chinese New Year holiday, and so people were generally back at work, back at school and they sought to continue working or studying but from home. And so we saw a slower uptake of entertainment-related applications, but a much faster uptake of productivity-related applications such as Tencent Meeting.And I think that accelerated uptake in productivity applications reflects, first of all, the fact that many more enterprises and consumers, and educational establishments are now familiar with how to use Tencent Meeting and WeCom's Tencent documents. And secondly, the fact that a number of our enterprise software services, in particular the Tencent Meeting, have boosted their market share substantially over the past two years. So that's on the digital content. In terms of how will the macro headwind affect specific businesses, unfortunately, COVID is affecting negatively most people in China, particularly in the affected cities.And we're not exempt from that. So I think that the negative impact is particularly notable on advertising, partly because of the overall pressure on GDP partly because many companies, especially multinationals, run their marketing budgets out of Shanghai. And then there's some impact on our payment volumes, as I mentioned, although that's more differentiated city by city rather than universal nationwide. Some negative impact on cloud project launches and then harder to see the impact on the game business.So I hope that covers off your first question. On the second question around the video-on-demand opportunity. Then in general, our belief is that over time, customers are migrating from barebones content delivery network toward a more sophisticated real-time video communications and ultimately toward integrated communications platform-as-a-service solutions. And as they migrate the competitive barriers to entry become higher and the margins correspondingly become healthier.So starting with content delivery network, there are many companies in China that are reselling telco bandwidth for CDN. We have some competitive advantage in that we have a very substantial in-house infrastructure, including lease lines that we actually own and operate. But frankly, it is a somewhat commoditized business. It's prone to price wars and margin compression.As you move to real-time video, then there's only a handful of companies that have the algorithms in order to provide low-latency video solutions. And we're one of them because we have the unique advantage of having supported billions of video chats for Weixin and QQ users for many years. And then as you move into communication platform-as-a-service, I think we're somewhat uniquely advantaged in that there are many enterprises where the salespeople are individually using Weixin any way to communicate with their customers. And so it's very natural for the enterprises to then aggregate those salespersons, customer relationships through the WeCom software and ultimately systematize with their provision of video chat, video communication within WeCom.In terms of the customer adoption rate, then I think both globally and in China, we're very optimistic about the trends we see and the trends we expect to see in the future. If you think about how corporations interact with consumers online, initially, they did it just by operating a website. They would include a telephone number. Then they facilitated email within the website.Then consumers wanted to move to a live chat. And in the future, I think it's an inevitability that many consumers for many products will want to move from message chat to a video chat. And so for companies, being able to provide low-latency real-time video interaction with the consumers will just become a cost of -- a necessary cost of doing business and a key competitive tool. So we're optimistic about communication platform-as-a-service and about low-latency real-time communications now and for the future.OperatorAll right. Thank you. Our next question comes from Eddie Leung from Bank of America. Please ask your question.Eddie Leung -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystGood evening. I have a question on your new cloud strategy. Just wondering if the changes will have any indication on the mix of your clients going forward, will that change the mix of clients in terms of vertical industries, the size of your clients as well as the sophistication of your clients? Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerWell, I think that cloud services in China is a little bit dissimilar from cloud services in the Western world in that historically and currently about 50% of revenue industrywide is from other Internet companies and 50% is from all sorts of primarily initially off-line businesses such as financial services, such as manufacturing, such as government and local services. And our shift is not intended to necessarily change that current demand reality. But I think that the shift is necessary in order to provide services cost effectively and, therefore, attractively to the off-line first businesses that are moving online. Because at the moment in China, and this was true in the West a few years ago, there's a propensity for companies for cloud vendors to provide in a very customized, very cost-heavy solution, so really to act as more as a system solution providers or IT consultancy services.And while that is achievable in an environment of kind of infinite capital, it's not scalable. I mean it's not sustainable. And therefore, it's not where the long-term growth will come from. So we have made a proactive decision that we are focusing on scalable and therefore sustainable and profitable opportunities.And I think if you look at the West, it's been very hard for companies that try to do both, to be successful at both. Generally, if you're still in the project deployment industry, then that remains your bread and butter versus those companies that have gone all in on truly cloud-based solutions have been the ones that have benefited most from the changing industry profile. So we have a big chunk of our revenue from other Internet companies, and that will continue. But in the long term, the greater growth will come from a whole range of other industries.And we have roughly half of our revenue within that segment from infrastructure and the other half from platform software and industry solutions, and we aspire to grow both, but particularly the latter.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Ronald Keung from Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question.Ronald Keung -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystThank you. Martin, James and John, I want to ask about our online advertising. So with the COVID lockdowns and consumption worsened into second quarter, I just want to hear how management thinks about the online advertising growth and maybe potential timing for stabilization or some forms of inflection. I think taking into different drivers like macro across different verticals, easier base for some of the verticals and any potential video account monetization in that? Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerYeah. Thank you. So what we've said in previous calls was that as we moved into the second half of 2022, then all our SQL advertising trends should inflect positively because, first of all, we'll lap a number of discrete regulatory changes, both affecting our advertisers and also affecting our own advertising media. And then secondly, because over time, we will bring onstream additional inventory, including the video accounts.The new factor since we last spoke has been the outbreak of COVID in a number of locations. And depending how quickly COVID is brought under control will determine whether our previous comments still holds true or whether the timetable gets pushed back because, again, the COVID is hurting consumption, which is unhelpful. It's also hurting logistics, especially through logistics through Shanghai, which is a logistics hub, which is more unhelpful. And then finally, it is impacting the city in China where most multinationals actually have their headquarters and to make their marketing decisions, which is further unhelpful.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from William Packer from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.William Packer -- Exane BNP Paribas -- AnalystHi, Management. Many thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, we've had lots of comments recently from various authorities talking to both the healthy development of the platform economy, in addition to completion of rectification in recent weeks. Could you help us understand how you think of those two important objectives and the implications for Tencent? And then secondly, operating cost growth slowed in Q1 relative to recent quarters, demonstrating good cost control.Could you help us think through the trajectory of cost growth over the rest of the year and the key puts and takes? Many thanks.Martin Lau -- PresidentOK. I'll take the first question. It is true that in the past two months, the Chinese government has actually released quite a bit of supported signals toward digital economy and platform economy at the top level. In particular, I would point to yesterday in a CPPCC meeting, chairman Wang Yang stated clearly to support stronger and high-quality as well as larger-scale digital economy.And vice-premier Liu He also reiterated the intention to firmly support platform economy as well as private economy. And I think that's consistent with last month, as of the end of last month, April 29th, when the politburo meeting convened and it stated the intention to foster a healthy development of the platform economy and to complete ratification actions on the platform economy, to implement a normalized deregulation and also to introduce specific measures to support healthy and compliance growth of the platform economy. So we can clearly see that from the senior-most level, there is a pretty clear supportive signals released. But I think for this to translate into a real impact on our business, there is going to be a time lag in process.I would say it would take time for the specific regulators and ministries to translate this direction into real actions. And I think in the politburo direction, it's pretty clear to state the sequence, right? There is a completion of the ratification actions and then they implement normalized deregulation and then introduce specific measures to support. While we would not be expecting these three actions to be specifically sequential, I would say the sequence is pretty much in that order. So it will take some time for the corrective measures to be turning into normalized regulation and then the specific supported measures would be introduced.So we would be working closely with the regulators and hope to see this transition to happen. And I think a positive development is that in April, the publishing bill started to approve BanHao, the publishing licenses for games. And it's definitely an encouraging sign. And we felt when the transition continue to happen, then the compliance and also well-behaving companies would start to benefit.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerWill, on the cost growth, let me break it into sort of four categories. So first of all, you can see in the first quarter that our sales and marketing expense growth slowed, which is good for us. It's a little bit of a double-edged sword in that a number of other Internet companies have also slowed their sales and marketing spend, which has impact on our advertising revenue, but it is something that we can control relatively quickly and we have controlled relatively quickly. A second bucket is around our general and admin expenses, which are largely tied to headcount and cost per head.And in the first quarter for a number of reasons, those general and admin expenses continue to grow at a rapid rate. However, you can see that our headcount growth is slowing down. The heads we're adding are, generally speaking, often lower-cost heads. And in general, our cost per head is also decelerating.So as we work through this year, we should expect the G&A expenses to decelerate. The third bucket is around the cost of sales and the impact on gross margin. And within this bucket, there are some actions we're taking, for example, managing costs within a Tencent Video that may take a few months to flow through. There's other actions such as exiting some of the lower-margin business services activity where would we see the benefits sooner.And then finally and easy to forget is that to get to our net income, you run through associate item and associate contributions have moved from a profit to a loss year on year. And one of the biggest reasons for that is simply that a number of our big associates in which we have substantial stakes ramped up their community group buying initiatives in the last year. So if you add it all up, if investee A spent x billion renminbi on community group buying, and we're actually accounting 15% of that loss. And investee B spent x billion renminbi on community group buying and where our associated accounting 12% of that loss and so on and so on.Then in a way, our associate income line effectively is a community group buying business all by itself because you add up multiple companies at 10%, 15%, 20% stakes and get to something that looks like our own community group buying business. And as you may be aware, those companies who were investing very aggressively in community group buying in the last 12 months have now fairly sharply slowed down that investment. And that will start flowing through their P&Ls and, therefore, also through our P&L via the associate income line. So those are four buckets within the cost discussion to think about.Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Charlene Liu from HSBC. Please go ahead.Charlene Liu -- HSBC -- AnalystThank you very much for the opportunity. I would like to ask a question regarding the gross margin for the advertising business. We saw that -- I just wanted to get a sense on, obviously, based on the various ad products, are we seeing -- sorry, sorry. I apologize.I think across various ad products, we wanted to get a sense on which are we going to see maybe faster or slower recovery? And how would that shift affect the online advertising CPM going forward? Because I think it came in a bit slower versus -- came in a bit lower versus our expectations. I apologize for the noise again.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerNo problem about the noise. Now I think in terms of the advertising results for the quarter, then it's worth being aware the Winter olympics cost us hundreds of millions of renminbi between the sort of broadcast rights and the actual operating expenses around it. And that's a low-margin activity that has a negative impact on the blended advertising gross margin. And then as we spoke about in Q4, the video accounts growth translates at the moment into more cost than revenue impact.And for better or worse, video accounts continue to grow video views very quickly in Q1. And so some of that flows through into the advertising segment costs. So looking forward, what happens with video accounts monetization will be an important driver of how incremental margins behave for the advertising business. Beyond that, within advertising, we have a mix of owned and operated properties that are inherently high margin like moments in video accounts, owned and operated properties that are lower margin such as our media services, and then the ad network business that is inherently low margin.And so depending how our growth pans out between those three categories, it will have a big impact on the blended gross margin. And that in turn is a function of which advertiser categories rebound the fastest because certain advertiser categories like luxury goods, for example, is skewed toward the high-margin owned and operated properties than other categories such as e-commerce, may skew toward low-margin ad network. It also depends on the impact of the advertising system changes we're putting through, which may show up in different times for different inventories. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Jerry Liu from UBS. Please ask your question.Jerry Liu -- UBS -- AnalystHi. Good evening. Thank you. I would like to just ask a couple of things on gaming, maybe separating domestic and international.First on domestic with the BanHao restarting, I'm wondering if we can be a little bit more positive on growth on either grossing or revenue growth later this year? Or should we have a little bit more patience given some of the titles might be coming later? And then on the international side, first of all, I was wondering if we did have that accounting adjustment that was discussed last quarter, if we had that in the first quarter at all? And then secondarily, can we see the international grossing accelerate? Or will the normalization from COVID take a bit longer to play out? Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerThank you for the game questions. On the international games, then, yes, we had a sort of catch-up of revenue in Q4 related to one of our subsidiaries, Supercell. And then there was a sort of accounting catch down of revenue in Q1 related to Riot. The catch down was smaller in magnitude than the catch up.In terms of the outlook then, we don't have a crystal ball. But generally speaking, the game business outside China particularly for popular mobile games had a very buoyant period from late 2020 through late 2021. And now it's facing a tough comparison against that period. And when I say it, I mean the industry as a whole.And there's a number of listed companies with big mobile games that have reported a similar phenomenon. So I think it's reasonable to expect that PUBG Mobile, there'll be tough comparatives for another few months before the year-on-year trends normalize toward the end of this year. Separate from PUBG Mobile, then most of our big PC games are doing fine, that they weren't as -- they didn't benefit from COVID as much necessarily and they aren't hurt by a COVID hangover. And then we have very kind of long life mobile games like Clash of Clans, which are also doing fine.The revenue bounces around a little bit quarter on quarter depending on the content release in a given quarter. But the user trends and the propensity to pay appear to be stable to growing over time. So that's -- and then as we look into 2023 and beyond, that's when we expect more sort of big-budget games that we've been ramping up in the last two years to be released and to start meaningfully impacting the international game revenue positively. On the domestic game business, then I think that as Martin suggested, the BanHao approval is positive for a number of reasons.One being that more games can be published. Another being the signaling effect in that it appears that the regulators are now much happier with where the industry is, and therefore, it's a more stable environment where people don't need to sort of look over their shoulder and try to second guess whether there's other regulatory changes looming on the horizon. So overall, we're very happy with the BanHao approvals. We ourselves didn't get a game on that approval list this time, which is fine.The period with no BanHao approvals obviously hurts most those start-up companies, which don't have any games and, therefore, don't have any cash flow versus the bigger, more established companies that already have games, already enjoy cash flow, and could ride out that period more comfortably. So we think that it was sort of very rational that the BanHao starts with the smaller game companies and then will move up to the bigger game companies, including ourselves in the future. I think in terms of the outlook, then, yes, with more BanHao being issued and with the industry now on a more stable regulatory footing, then it's reasonable to expect that the industry grossing trends will begin to improve as we move through the year. And over time, that will then translate into reported revenue trends, but it's not an immediate process, and it will take several months to play out.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from John Choi from Daiwa. Please ask your question.John Choi -- Daiwa Capital Markets -- AnalystThank you very much for taking my question. I have two questions. So first of all, I think Weixin video accounts has continued to gain good traction. Can management elaborate a bit more about the potential of this advertising business in the longer run? I know that we are still focusing on user engagement and carefully trying to grow the business.But eventually, would it be fair for us to see a similar advertising business ad loads or business potentials such as our peers in this area? That's my first question. My second question is we noticed that the investees, the value has come up a lot this quarter given the market volatility. Has this made us to rethink of our investment strategy going forward? And what would be our key focus? I think management did mention previously, there will be more of a balanced approach. But I was wondering if we -- if this might be more opportunity for us to play aggressive offense or a bit more conservative going forward? Thank you.Pony Ma -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo I will take the first question. In terms of video accounts, it is true that we're very encouraged by the strong growth momentum of video accounts in terms of video viewed as well as time spent. And I think if you want to think about the monetization potential, I would say, eventually, right, it should have a similar monetization per time spent with similar products in the market. But it will take time to get there.And along the way, we'll continue to improve the user experience so that we try to strike a better balance between monetization and user experience. So a case in point is like our moments advertising. We would be probably releasing inventories into the market on a more gradual basis than the industry peers. And along the way, we'll continue to make improvements.And our ad load may or may not be the same. Most likely, I would say our ad load probably will not be the same. It would probably be more self-restrained in terms of the ad load. But we felt we can actually achieve potentially a higher CPM eventually by continuously improving the technology, by leveraging the fact that both the user base as well as the contents are actually high end in nature, and leveraging the fact that there's better connection with the overall Weixin ecosystem, including official accounts and the social graph as well as the social communication infrastructure and the connection to Mini Programs so that their conversion can actually increase.And the fact that I would say, when you have a shorter total amount of time spent on the platform versus a longer time, the more of a diminishing margin return actually starts coming. So the first 20 minutes is probably going to be worth more than the last 20 minutes. So that's sort of the overall way for which you would think about this. And over time, I was trying to strike a better balance between monetization and user experience, but also try to unleash the full potential of the monetization of this platform.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerAnd on your second question around our portfolio of investments in other listed companies and the reduction in the value thereof quarter on quarter, then as a first point, if you look at the reduction in value, actually, a very big percentage of that reduction was due to the proactive steps we took that I think are very good for investors, meaning we distributed the stake in JD worth about $16 billion directly to investors. We disposed of $3 billion stake in another company and the proceeds of that then partially being used for buybacks of our own stock. And we also disposed of a couple of billion dollars of stakes in other companies. So all in, during the first quarter, if you compare the capital we sort of raised from divestments and distributions, it was about four times bigger than the capital we put to work investing in other companies.And so of course, when we do those divestments and distributions, then it's inevitable and natural and desirable that the value of our portfolio that remains is diminished by the divestments in distributions. Looking forward, we continue to be active in divestments. And we're very cognizant of the multiple macro risks out there, particularly the fact that central banks in the developed world are generally increasing interest rates at very rapid rates. And this is something that hasn't been seen for decades.And it has implications for how investors value some of the high-growth, low-margin, high-duration tech companies, which represent a portion of our portfolio. So we are very thoughtful about those risks and managing those risks. And one of the ways that we do manage those risks is through the step-up in the pace of divestments, distributions, and so forth. But that said, we also are a company that generates very substantial free cash flow.We're a company, by virtue of our position, we have insight into emerging technology trends among consumers, among enterprises. And we see new opportunities, interesting opportunities emerging, or sometimes we see old opportunities which we're familiar with from previous investments reemerging as valuations decline. So we're being very selective. We're being very disciplined, both in terms of investing carefully and also divesting where necessary.But we continue to find opportunities and we continue to put capital to work against those opportunities.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Gary Yu from Morgan Stanley. The line is open. Please ask a question.Gary Yu -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystHi. Good evening. Thank you for the opportunity to ask a question. I actually have two follow-up questions to the prior questions.First one is on advertising margin. I understand that there are multiple factors affecting the margin. Could management help us to kind of quantify or rank different factors in terms of level of impact, be it lower eCPM from our more profitable inventory? And also some of the COVID impact, some of it is video account investment, so how should we look at kind of margin trend going forward based on these various impact? The second question is regarding the comment on cost optimization. Is there any room for more aggressive control in terms of headcount-related G&A or R&D expenses.I understand that there's a slight increase in headcount still in first quarter. Is there any further room for more optimization, either from noncore business or any other areas where we can see more aggressive cost cutting from this area? Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerYes. So on the advertising margins, I think that last quarter, we tried to prioritize or rank, force rank the various factors that were affecting our advertising business. The top factor was really regulations impacting demand, regulations impacting categories such as education and games and reducing that demand for advertising. A lesser factor was regulations impacting supply, such as the flash screen ads.And those have some negative impact on our ad network business, but less so on moments or official accounts where the challenge was more of a demand problem. Refreshing that framework this quarter, then the paramount driver is COVID. The COVID situation is tragic, and it has negative consequences for advertising spend for the multiple, the three different reasons that I talked about earlier. And for us -- and while the current COVID outbreak's being brought under control, then they're very -- it's a great challenge for the advertising industry.Again, the good news is that while it's taken a period of time for the COVID to be brought under control in Shanghai, it was brought under control very quickly in Shenzhen. So there is a precedent in the very recent past for successfully bringing COVID under control. The less good news for our advertising business is that Shanghai is the sort of capital, if you will, for media advertising marketing decisions in China particularly for multinational companies and Shenzhen is not. And then so with the situation in Shanghai, it has a disproportionate impact on advertising nationwide.Thank you.Martin Lau -- PresidentIn terms of cost control -- I'll answer the second question. In terms of cost control, I think for cost items in relation to the organization and staff, our principle is that the optimization is done based on structural changes and structural needs. So we're not likely going to react to temporary factors, which will go away in the short to medium term. So if we look at the current situation, the incremental negative impact is actually largely related to COVID.So that's why we felt we're not going to react to this by optimizing our organization and staff further. But we may pursue other cost controls such as reduction in marketing costs. If there's further lockdown, then there's probably not that much we need to do as much marketing, for example. So that will be the routes that we'll be looking at.But I think organization and staff is going to be much more based on structural factors.OperatorAll right. Our next question comes from Elinor Leung from CLSA. Please ask your question.Elinor Leung -- CLSA -- AnalystHey. Thank you very much, management for just opportunity to ask questions. The first question is regarding the resumption of the game approval. Given in the first month, there's only five -- 45 new game is approved, do you think there is a structural change in the market that the government is going to approve less game than before the suspension? If that's the case, how is that going to affect our future game growth if we get less new game in the future? And the second question is regarding the mobile app network.We see a sharp decline in the quarter because of the regulatory change. And what do you think the future of this mobile app network in the future? Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerI think on mobile ad network, it's an industry that is prevalent globally. It's an industry that's sort of necessary for the economic survival of smaller and medium-sized apps and websites. And so it's an industry that's here to stay in China. It's been through many previous shocks.But we haven't talked about it as much in the past because during the PC Internet era, Tencent was really a laggard or not present in the PC ad network. And it was only with the boom in mobile Internet that we became a substantial participant in mobile ad network. So this cycle, the two big participants in mobile ad network, us and ByteDance, are different from the big participants in prior cycles. But ad network has rebounded from prior cycles.And I'm sure it will rebound from this cycle because on the supply side, there's enormous amount of inventory sitting in these small- and medium-sized apps that needs to be monetized for the apps to survive. And on the demand side, there's always advertisers who are looking for incremental traffic even if it's from less branded media sites. On the game BanHao, then the answer is yes. We believe that, generally speaking, there will be fewer game approvals in the future than they were in the pre-2018 period.And we have held that belief now for a couple of years. And it's a big part of the reason why in the last two years, we've reconfigured our game business from top to bottom to focus on releasing and usually developing fewer, bigger budget, and hopefully better games. And we think that we have been -- we are really a pioneer in the industry in terms of doing that. At any point in time, we generally have a similar or smaller pipeline than some of our competitors who have much fewer headcount.And the reason is because we're putting more headcount against each game and the belief that only a limited number of games will secure the BanHao in the future. And therefore, we want to make that limited number of games to be all that they can be. And I think that while we're very early in this, the results so far are quite positive. If you look at 2021, then 2 of the games that we released were the two most successful games in the industry by -- measured by users.And this year, the Return to Empire game is now the No. 2 in strategy genre. That's a small user but high ARPU genre. And then more importantly, looking forward, we're pretty excited about the quality of the content that we have in our pipeline.And again, it's a narrower pipeline with fewer, but we think bigger, better titles than would have been the case three years ago because of this change in the regulatory environment as well as the change in user taste even without the regulatory change. Users are becoming more sophisticated, more informed about the quality of games, and therefore, it makes sense to focus more resources on fewer, bigger bets.Wendy Huang -- Investor Relations OfficerOperator, let's take the one last question.OperatorThank you. Our last question comes from the line of Alex Yao from J.P. Morgan. Please ask your question.Alex Yao -- J.P. Morgan -- AnalystThank you management for taking my question. A couple of follow-up questions. Number one, on cloud. In this quarter, we have seen the revenue impact on cloud given the strategy of the transition.Can you share with us the margin trends in the transition? So that's the first one. Second one is on the video -- the long form video business. I understand you guys are sharply focusing on cost optimization and the margin improvement this year. Does this also apply to the video business? Is it improving margin, achieving breakeven, one of your key priority in this line of business? Thank you.John Lo -- Chief Financial OfficerIn terms of the impact on the cloud in respect of the gross margin, it actually improved a bit because of the fact that we have mentioned getting away from loss-suffering contracts. So it did help us in this quarter.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy OfficerIn terms of your question about Tencent Video, then people use the word healthy a great deal, probably too much, in connection with China Internet. But we -- our aspiration is not to get our video business to a temporary breakeven situation. It is to, over time, move our video business to a structurally healthy and sustainable position. And in reality, there have been quarters in the past when Tencent Video has already achieved breakeven, but we didn't sustain that.And what's critical is really sustaining it. Achieving one-quarter breakeven is not difficult in the video industry. You can choose not to commission expensive content. You can choose, even though you've already commissioned expensive content, not to air the content in that quarter because then the reported P&L that quarter is flattened.You can choose in the current quarter to write off capitalized video content so you have a big loss this quarter, and then the next quarter, you add that content, it still picks up some traffic and revenue. So the incremental margin optically is very high even though the true economic return is not attractive. And those are things that one can do if one wants to be breakeven next quarter. But that's not what we're aspiring to achieve.We're trying to just move the business to a structurally healthy position. And I think we've already done what I hope is the most challenging part, which is that Tencent Video was the eighth or ninth company to enter the space in China. It's now the clear leader in terms of subscribers, in terms of subscription revenue, in terms of advertising revenue. As I mentioned, it has already achieved breakeven in some past quarters.And now we want to move toward a sustainably profitable position. And part of that is continuing to optimize the revenue through price rationalization and so forth. Another part of it is being continually selective about the content that we air. And when we were moving from ninth place to seventh place to fifth place, we had to compete in every kind of content because we didn't know which content really mattered.Now that we're in the first place, we have much greater clarity on what content counts, what content doesn't. And so we can be more selective about allocating our spending for the content that counts. And then finally and somewhat differentiated, we also have the opportunity that we're seizing to benefit from in the vertical integration with upstream IP over which we already have influence, whether that's because the upstream IP is a web novel within China Literature or its content produced by new classic media or it's a mobile game from the Tencent game portfolio. So the long-form video industry in China has been an extremely challenging industry for many years.And now it's as difficult as it's ever been. But the industry has also now moved toward a much more rational stance in terms of costs, in terms of ARPU. And we are seeking to continue that shift and ultimately make this a good return business just as long-form video elsewhere in the world is a good return business.

            "description": "According to NetEase Cloud Music, it has formally initiated judicial proceedings against Tencent Music. The company is suing Tencent for unfair competition and for illegally pirating songs and batch-washing songs under false names. A series of measures to implement acts of unfair competition. Even though we all admit that unfair competition occurs from time to time in business, there are few fields that are as dead as Chinese online music due to unfair competition.For a long time, Tencent Music Entertainment Group (including QQ Music, Kuwo Music, Kugou Music, National K Song and other products) has illegally played unauthorized songs. NetEase claims that it has been faking songs in batches and copies its product innovation. Here are the main complaints that NetEase has against Tencent.Top 3 infringements1. Malicious infringement of copyrighta. QQ Music pirate broadcasts through the \u201cregional play\u201d functionNetEase Cloud Music claims that for a long time, QQ Music, a subsidiary of Tencent Music Entertainment Group, repeatedly lists its popular works without authorization. The company claims that after filing for rights protection, QQ Music had to change tactics. QQ Music then targets Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hangzhou areas. In other areas where it knows NetEase was not looking, it continues to pirate and release NetEase\u2019s products.From a provincial level, QQ Music cannot play NetEase Cloud Music\u2019s rights-entitled songs in Beijing, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, and Guangzhou, Guangdong. However, it can be played in Xi\u2019an, Jiangsu, Suzhou and other provinces and cities;From the same provincial-level region, taking Zhejiang Province as an example, under the circumstance that QQ Music cannot play NetEase Cloud Music\u2019s rights and interests songs in Hangzhou City, all other ten prefecture-level cities in Zhejiang Province, such as Shaoxing, Huzhou, Jiaxing, Ningbo, Zhoushan, etc., all have illegal acts of secretly releasing the songs involved in the case.The number of infringing works pirated by QQ Music in different regions is huge. In addition, they are all popular songs on the NetEase Cloud Music platform. QQ Music\u2019s behaviour violates copyright and seriously violates business ethics. Its behaviour ignores laws, regulations, and business ethics. Its subjective maliciousness is obvious.b. QQ Music secretly releases NetEase\u2019s works through the \u201cImport External Playlist\u201d functionFor unlicensed songs, QQ Music has developed the function of copying and re-importing the link of its platform\u2019s playlist. It can then replay and download the original playlist.Take the popular song \u201cDisplacement Time and Space (Ai Chen)\u201d as an example, the search on the QQ music station shows \u201cno sound source\u201d. However, after copying the playlist link and importing it (the import playlist link contains y.qq.com), you can playback and download the song.QQ Music pirates copyright-free works by \u201cimporting external playlists\u201d. Such a piecemeal and sneaky move damages the rights and interests of musicians. It also infringes copyright and destroys the fragile mutual trust between the industries.c. Tencent Music batched unlicensed popular songs with fake names and malicious interceptionFor a long time, Tencent Music\u2019s QQ Music, Kugou Music, and Kuwo Music have produced a large number of impostor and song-washing works for unauthorized works.In 2020 alone, Tencent Music successively launched a large number of fake songs of the same name for popular songs. The chorus part of nearly a thousand songs is the same or similar to the original song.For example, after the \u201cDelete Bar\u201d launched by NetEase Cloud Music Cloud Studio and Shensheng Culture, a large number of songs with the same name and different lyrics appeared in QQ Music and Kugou Music. We have things like \u201cDelete Bar\u201d (official version), \u201cDelete Bar\u201d (new version), \u201cDeleted Bar\u201d (original singing) and \u201cDeleted Bar\u201d (Tik Tok Hot Search Smoke Voice Version), etc. All these are just malicious ways to pirate the song.Even the names of the singers of some of the fake songs are \u201chigh imitations\u201d of the original singers. For example, in a product of Tencent Music Entertainment Group, the musician \u201cLao Fan next door\u201d is written as \u201cLao Pan next door\u201d. Under the \u201cLao Pan next door\u201d, QQ Music lists all the works of \u201cLao Fan next door\u201d. Thus, it misleads users to click and listen.What\u2019s more, some companies under the Tencent Music Entertainment Group are even more purposeful and organized to participate in the song-washing industry chain. As long as NetEase Cloud Music releases a hit song, Tencent Music\u2019s three products will not only directly pirate the original song but will also intensify its efforts to launch a large number of shoddy songs with the same name. In fact, this happens within a day or two after releasing the new song.2. Long-term plagiarism of NetEase Cloud Music\u2019s visual designa. QQ Music, Kugou Music, Kuwo Music plagiarized NetEase Cloud Music vinyl play page designSince its official launch in April 2013, the unique vinyl playback interface is the core design of NetEase Cloud Music products. The company also has relevant design patents. In October 2020, the iPad version of Kugou Music updated the playback interface. The new vinyl interface design is very similar to the NetEase Cloud Music vinyl playback interface.In March 2022, the Kugou Ringtone App and Kuwo\u2019s \u200b\u200b2496 App also used a similar design. In April 2022, the updated version of QQ Music also provided a vinyl playback interface. The design concept and interface are highly similar to NetEase Cloud Music vinyl page.b. Kugou Music and QQ Music plagiarize NetEase Cloud Music\u2019s \u201cListen Together\u201d functionIn July 2020, NetEase Cloud Music officially launched the \u201clisten together\u201d function. Thanks to the cloud village community atmosphere and unique interactive experience, \u201clisten together\u201d quickly became a feature that was widely praised by the industry and popular with users. In January 2021, Kugou launched the \u201cFollow and Listen\u201d function. Its function settings and page interaction design can be called pixel-level plagiarism of NetEase Cloud Music \u201cListen Together\u201d.In February 2021, QQ Music updated the \u201cMusic Room\u30fbListen Together\u201d function, and the function name was \u201cListen Together\u201d with NetEase Cloud Music. In August 2021, the 10.16.5 version of QQ Music also directly renames the \u201cmusic room\u201d to \u201clisten together\u201d.3. Kugou Music copied NetEase Cloud Music\u2019s \u201cYunbei Push Song\u201d function setting and interface designIn April 2020, NetEase Cloud Music launched the \u201cYunbei Push Song\u201d function in version 7.1.10 to support users to promote their favourite songs. Three months later, Kugou Music also completed the follow-up and launched the \u201cmusic push\u201d function. It once again carried out pixel-level plagiarism from NetEase function settings and interface design.Over the years, Tencent Music Entertainment Group has carried out unfair competition against NetEase Cloud Music and the entire online music industry. It also has a long time, wide scope, various means and tragic consequences.According to the \u201cAnti-Unfair Competition Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China\u201d, \u201cThe Copyright Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China\u201d as well as other relevant regulations, NetEase Cloud Music has filed a complaint against Tencent Music Entertainment Group (including QQ Music, Kuwo Music, Kugou Music and other products).",

            "description": "Are you looking to showcase your brand in front of the brightest minds of the gaming industry? Consider getting a custom GamesBeat sponsorship. Learn more.Tencent is the biggest game company in the world, and that is saying a lot considering rivals such as Microsoft, Sony, and Embracer Group have been acquiring so many game companies in an effort to become much bigger and more competitive.Steven Ma, senior vice president of Tencent, has a global view of the game industry and he can explain why we\u2019re seeing so many changes, like Take-Two\u2019s acquisition of Zynga and Microsoft\u2019s planned purchase of Activision Blizzard. Tencent has a global view because it owns stakes in companies such as Riot Games, Ubisoft, Activision Blizzard, Supercell, Dontnod Entertainment, and Bloober.Tencent wants to deliver high-quality games, and those titles take $100 million to $300 million or more to make now. And smaller game studios need financial backing to make such games. It\u2019s happening with mobile games too as triple-A quality comes to mobile. That\u2019s why the acquisitions are happening, as it puts the necessary capital behind the games the studios are making. And it\u2019s why this consolidation can be good for gamers, said Ma.Ma noted that Tencent has moved more to the global stage of games since the last time we talked in 2019. Last year, 26% of Tencent\u2019s revenues came from outside of China. That will accelerate in the future, and it\u2019s why Ma is spending about 60% of his time looking outside of China. What\u2019s he looking for? New innovations in gameplay, new game genres, and the kind of exciting games that will get gamers excited and drive the industry forward.Event GamesBeat at the Game Awards We invite you to join us in LA for GamesBeat at the Game Awards event this December 7. Reserve your spot now as space is limited!Learn MoreTencent recently acquired Turtle Rock, maker of the Back 4 Blood and Left 4 Dead games, and it has opened new triple-A game studios in Montreal, Seattle, and Los Angeles. And while it is expanding rapidly, it has to be careful to focus on backing the right teams. We talked about all these things and more, like the metaverse and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).Here\u2019s an edited transcript of our interview.Steven Ma is senior vice president of Tencent.GamesBeat: We last talked in 2019, in March. A long time ago. A lot of things have changed.Steven Ma: 2019 seems like a long time ago, even if it\u2019s just three years. The whole world changed.GamesBeat: When we last talked you had 140 games in 200 countries with 200 million gamers playing them. What are some interesting milestones for you today?Ma: Of course, COVID has changed the world. We\u2019re seeing new markets emerge. We have many more players now around the world. I can\u2019t talk about an exact number at this point, but it\u2019s significantly bigger than the last time we talked. Second, for Tencent as a whole, we\u2019re more focused on the global market compared to 2019. While most of our players and our revenue are still in China, if you look at last year, we had very large numbers of users outside China. Last year 26% of our revenue came from outside China. That\u2019s a big milestone for us.GamesBeat: In the last few years, have your own responsibilities changed or grown in any way?Ma: Not really. But one thing that\u2019s changed for me is that I spend more time focused on the global market now. Before, I only spent maybe 20% of my time looking overseas. I spent most of my time in China. Right now I\u2019m spending more like 60% of my time focused on the global market. I hope I can get back to traveling again. It\u2019s been almost two years since I last traveled to North America. But I just came back from a long trip in Europe last month. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get back to traveling and face-to-face meetings soon.GamesBeat: When people ask you how gaming has changed in the last few years, is there a simple way to explain it, to help people to understand how different everything is now?Ma: From our view, it revolves around a few things. First, we\u2019re mainly focused on the mobile game platforms. There, the user base is much bigger. We saw some very high-quality games come to mobile platforms, like Call of Duty Mobile and Genshin Impact. We\u2019re seeing triple-A quality on mobile platforms. That\u2019s been a change in the last few years.Second, emerging markets are growing quickly. Markets like the middle east, like southeast Asia, like Latin America, they\u2019re growing very quickly. It\u2019s similar to what we saw in China in 2012 or 2013, when the mobile market shot up there. The same things are happening. That\u2019s presenting new opportunities for the whole game industry.We always talk a lot about game genres because we believe that core gameplay is the key to the industry. I\u2019ve talked about that before. We don\u2019t see as much of that big impact in the game industry, on the core gameplay side. We\u2019re not seeing anything like when battle royale hit, with the arrival of PUBG and Fortnite. That hasn\u2019t happened recently. We\u2019re still looking for that new kind of gameplay. That\u2019s a key for us, for the industry, and for gamers. That\u2019s something we need to be looking for.GamesBeat: So you believe that gamers are ready for some kind of change in gameplay?Ma: Of course! That kind of innovation, new gameplay and new game genres, it\u2019s not that easy. Maybe we see it once or twice every decade. It\u2019s not easy. But as we look at what\u2019s happening in the market, a lot of games have that potential. We can\u2019t say we already know the formula for making it happen. But if you look at roguelike, at open-world sandbox, at survival and crafting, those kinds of keywords have made some games very successful. We believe the next powerful game genres should be some kind of combination of keywords within that group. It hasn\u2019t happened yet, but I believe people are looking for it.PUBG MobileGamesBeat: You\u2019ve made some announcements recently, like the new studios in Los Angeles and Seattle, and acquiring Turtle Rock. What kind of strategy should we see in moves like that?Ma: Right now we believe we should make games for players worldwide. Our player numbers in China are very strong. Our numbers in emerging markets are very strong. Our numbers in mature markets like the United States and western Europe are very strong. More and more we see that people around the world play the same kinds of games and ask for the same kinds of quality. A change in strategy for us, first, is to try and make games for global players. We believe that players are the same wherever they are \u2013 in China, in Brazil, in North America.Second, we have a very open mind about all platforms. The largest player audience is on mobile platforms, of course. But the PC market has the hardcore player community, the keyboard and mouse players. That\u2019s the best place to bring new innovations, if you want to create good gameplay together with your community. Meanwhile, if you look at consoles, a big TV will always bring the best experience to players. We\u2019re trying to make games that can use all the advantages of different platforms.At the same time, we\u2019ve seen some trends for new game genres, and some keywords that have potential. We believe that kind of innovation should combine with a baseline of very high quality. We\u2019ll try to combine the quality of triple-A PC and console games with new gameplay. We believe that\u2019s the key to creating the next big thing. If we want to do that, we need teams dedicated to that work in China and the west as well. That\u2019s the strategy.Honor of Kings is one of Tencent\u2019s big hits.GamesBeat: Like a lot of other game companies right now, are you having a hard time finding the people you need to hire to make these games? Are you having to invest more in each game?Ma: You\u2019re right. Right now, if you want to make very high-quality games, the costs are getting higher and higher. I don\u2019t believe that trend is going to stop. People are always asking for higher quality. But at the same time, that can slow down development and innovation. For creative work, people need to work face to face together. In my view, COVID might have caused a 30% loss of efficiency in a lot of game development. That\u2019s a problem.GamesBeat: How do you successfully communicate to developers that you want them to come and work for Tencent? It sounds like you might have to make more noise than you usually do.Ma: The best way, always\u2013we encourage the people who build games and we support their studios in making great games. We have a lot of resources. But the way to communicate with studios, I believe, is a more balanced view of game development. The team needs to want to make a successful game. If they believe in their direction, their gameplay, their idea, their concept, that\u2019s the starting point for a successful game. We\u2019re looking for teams and studios that believe in their ideas.At the same time, we\u2019ll try to use our resources to help them with what they can do. Sometimes your idea, your vision is not on the same level as your capabilities. That part we can help with, a lot. We have our central tech teams. We have a lot of resources. We have our network around the world with different studios that can help each other. They know what they can do. We also monitor the market very closely, and we\u2019re very close to the community. Tencent, as a game company, we truly believe in being community-driven. We hear from our players. We can help our studios and development teams know more about what they should do.The best way, the balanced way of game development is for the team to know what they want to do, what they can do, and what they should do. They need a balanced plan to make a great game. That\u2019s what we try to communicate to developers. At the same time, we also push our studios, because we believe in a few things. One, as I always say, core gameplay is the key in this market. We encourage all our studios, all our developers, to look for the next big thing in new game genres, like what happened with League of Legends in MOBA or PUBG and Fortnite in battle royale.As we talked about before, too, players want bigger and bigger games, and that drives costs higher. We believe the game as a service model is a good answer for the market. Right now we\u2019re still at an early stage. Some games using this model have problems. But we believe it\u2019s the future of the market. Part of that, again, is that we believe in being community-driven. We want all of our developers to have the ability to talk to their players, listen to their players, and have good interactions with their player community. That\u2019s a key to success.Finally, although new markets are still on the way up, their tastes are very much like those of mature markets. We believe that high-quality games for the mass market are key. We\u2019ll always try to use our resources to support our developers in trying to make high-quality games for the mass market.GamesBeat: What are the most interesting gaming trends to you right now?Ma: I was talking about emerging markets before. If you look at the numbers from as far back as 2000, there were perhaps 100 million game players worldwide. The last time we talked in 2019, that number was 1.8 billion people playing games world. Today I\u2019d say that number is closer to 2.5 billion people. That\u2019s a big jump for the whole industry, and very good news. It means big things are going to change.Also, as I said before, all the platforms are merging together. In 2016, 2017, 2018, those years, the mobile platforms and console platforms were two totally different worlds. The industry, the users, everything was different. But now we\u2019re seeing those two markets merge together more and more.Sniping in Call of Duty: Mobile.GamesBeat: Square Enix sold off its western game studios and talked about focusing on blockchain games, NFTs, and other things they\u2019re working on. How strategically do you look at things like NFTs and blockchain as areas to invest in?Ma: It\u2019s a big question. We view technology as a very important thing. What I always say internally is that for the game industry, the most important thing is gameplay. Then narrative, and then technology. Gameplay is the key to having fun in games. Narratives and stories are how you create a background, how you make people believe in a game. Technology is a game-changer for the industry as well, but we see a change like that every decade or two, perhaps, a big technology change. The last one we saw was the arrival of mobile platforms, smartphones, and before that it was probably 3D graphics. We\u2019re close to looking for the new game-changing technology. But things like NFTs are very early. Today I don\u2019t see what they can do as far as a real game-changer.With new technology, if you want to make a big impact on the industry, usually the final result is something that leads to new gameplay. 3D graphics made a big impact on the industry because they led to new genres and new gameplay like first-person shooters. With NFTs today I can\u2019t see the impact they\u2019re having on gameplay yet, on the game experience. That hasn\u2019t happened today. But who knows? We\u2019re at a very early stage.At the same time, I believe in things like VR and AR. That kind of technology could be an interesting area. We\u2019ve put some resources into trying to help build innovation in those areas. I mentioned 3D graphics and mobile platforms as big advances. Those led to new experiences for players. Today we have some very exciting technology in VR. We can track the player\u2019s movements, their hands and their eyes. See-through solutions will allow people to interact with their environment while they\u2019re playing games. VR headsets will become smaller and lighter. We\u2019re seeing 4K OLED displays make a real difference in the experience. That kind of new technology could happen in the next three to five years. We believe we should prepare for that, both around platforms and on the content side. That\u2019s an interesting and exciting area for the industry.A scene if Call of Duty: Mobile.GamesBeat: To me it seems like the metaverse might be a much bigger change than just NFTs. It\u2019s not only changing games, how we play games, but also changing the platforms potentially, how those games get to players. Do you have any observations about the metaverse?Ma: This is what I like about the game industry. If you look at the history of technology, usually games are the industry that is pushing technology to extremes, and at the same time toward a mass market, toward millions or billions of players. That speeds up the development of technology. For the metaverse, for the next generation of experiences on the internet, games will be an important part of what\u2019s pushing that industry.GamesBeat: One hard part about expanding worldwide is that geopolitics often has an effect around the world. Different regions have their problems. We have a war in Ukraine right now. How concerned are you about the way geopolitics affect the game industry?Ma: Tencent is a global company. We have teams around the world. Our way of managing our business is more bottom-up. Decisions are made by our studios, by our local teams. Because we view emerging markets as quite important, we try to set up strong local teams in these areas. Those teams play an active role in all of our business. With local people making their own decisions, this way of managing our business makes it much easier to handle situations like what we see today.At the same time, all the games we make are for global players. If you look at something like PUBG Mobile, you can\u2019t just say, \u201cThat\u2019s a Chinese game.\u201d It\u2019s a game made for players worldwide.GamesBeat: Do you think that gamers are changing as well, in that they want to create a lot more of their own games? It seems like the rise of things like Roblox and Minecraft suggests that that\u2019s a trend to pay attention to on a global level.Ma: It\u2019s an interesting trend. We also believe it\u2019s an area of huge potential in the game industry. With NFTs, people always say that they\u2019ll decentralize everything, decentralize control and governance. But I believe more in decentralizing capability to the players. If you look at what\u2019s happened in the engine business, with things like Unreal, before those tools were only for professionals. Only very skilled people who had been in the industry for many years could use them. But we\u2019ve seen more technology work its way down to indie developers. Now, if you have three or five people, you can develop games with really good graphics and gameplay, a full game. There was a time when you couldn\u2019t have imagined that.More and more, that kind of technology, combined with new platforms, will decentralize capabilities and development tools to players. If they have those kinds of capabilities, they\u2019ll make their own things. People want to make things, to craft things. It\u2019s why crafting is such a big part of so many game genres.Recently I had a meeting with Tim Sweeney to talk about things like the metaverse. The question was, what\u2019s the difference? I would say, we play games. We watch movies. But we\u2019ll live in the metaverse. We\u2019ll spend more time and try to do different kinds of things in the metaverse. That\u2019s very different from current online games.Really, the metaverse idea isn\u2019t that new. My first online game, back in 1997 or 1998, was Ultima Online. It already had a persistent world. In that way, it was almost like the metaverse. But at that time the technology just wasn\u2019t ready. Today, the technology could be here very soon. That\u2019s why we can talk about the metaverse today.GamesBeat: One technology I\u2019m looking forward to is the ability to jump from one world to another world in real time without having to wait, without having to download another game. Do you think that experience is far away, or is that getting closer?Ma: It could be here very quickly. Cloud gaming can definitely make that happen. If you put everything in the cloud, the user experience could allow very quick jumps from one game to another game, and everything would still look incredible.Right now, though, cloud gaming has a few problems. The cost is still very high if you want to guarantee players will get a high-quality experience. We don\u2019t have the right business model now to maintain that kind of experience. Second, a new technology should have a native kind of gameplay that\u2019s built around that technology, that uses all the advantages of that technology. But right now all we\u2019re talking about in cloud gaming is usually just streaming current PC, console, and mobile games. That\u2019s one thing you can do with it, but it\u2019s not the best thing to do with it. We need to have native gameplay enabled by cloud gaming.PUBG Mobile is one of Tencent\u2019s big titles.GamesBeat: As a more general question, how important do you think gaming is to the world?Ma: Internally we talk about ideas like how to define a game. Right now a game is something we play on PC, console, or mobile. You have a controller. You\u2019re fighting or shooting or solving puzzles. But that\u2019s not what makes up a game. Games use information technology to create cultural entertainment. That\u2019s been happening ever since electronics entered the mass market 100 years ago. We had the movies, TV, radio, everything. We believe that new technology leads to continuing innovation.As I was saying, games are very often the first mass-market application of new technology. When I talk to people working in the VR industry today and ask them about what stage of development we\u2019re at right now, they compare it to the Atari 2600, back in the earliest days of video games in the 1970s. It was one of the first computing devices of any kind to reach the mass market. After four or five years, the IBM PC came to the market. Even today, if you look at all kinds of new technology, whether it\u2019s the metaverse or cloud or VR, it all happened in the game industry first. The costs came down and people learned how to build new applications. Then it spread to other industries. Games are the main driver of technology.You can look at a particular company, like Nvidia. Nvidia is very important to the AI industry today, and AI is important to all kinds of things. But Nvidia\u2019s starting point was in games, making graphics cards for games. That\u2019s a very good example.GamesBeat: It\u2019s interesting that some of the biggest companies in the world have come to gaming. There\u2019s Tencent. Netflix is moving in. Las Vegas Sands is funding some studios. Blackstone. Lots of different large companies have noticed gaming. What do you think about some of the changes that might happen because of all the attention gaming is drawing?Ma: All the big players in the internet, in the technology industries, they know that what\u2019s important is the platform, the application, and the content. If you look at all these things together, games are important to all of them.GamesBeat: When I see gamers react to some of the big deals that have happened in the industry, like Microsoft buying Activision Blizzard, or Sony buying Bungie, quite often it feels like they\u2019re worried about the changes that are going to happen because of these deals. Do you have any way of reassuring them that this is going to be good for them, as change comes to everything?Ma: One thing gamers should understand is the reason for these kinds of acquisitions is because the cost of development is getting bigger and bigger. Activision might have been a special case, but a lot of studio acquisitions happen because if you want to make great games, games that are innovative, games that have high quality, the development costs could be $100 million, $200 million, $300 million. Small studios can\u2019t afford that risk. They need support from the big companies, the big platforms. That\u2019s why these deals happen. I feel like the results are clear. We\u2019ll get more games with high quality. That\u2019s good for gamers.League of Legends: Wild RiftGames are still an innovative industry, a creative industry. For Tencent, we\u2019ve been lucky to catch some big opportunities. We picked up League of Legends in MOBA, and we picked up PUBG in battle royale. But these kinds of things all start from very small teams. PUBG\u2019s developers came from DayZ, from H1Z1, very small projects made by small teams, or even just by individual people. We\u2019ll see more and more of those kinds of opportunities. And as I was saying, technology is becoming more decentralized, reaching smaller teams and more people. In the future, indie developers will be more active in the industry.Of course we see the trend toward big corporations creating more action in the market. But at the same time, because of platforms like YouTube and Twitch and Discord, we\u2019re seeing players reach developers more and more directly. Developers can talk directly to their players. Game communities have never been stronger than they are today. One thing I always say to our development teams is to listen to their community, and use every channel possible to talk to them. Right now players have more influence on the industry and developers than they ever have. That\u2019s a good opportunity for players.GamesBeat: It feels like the right strategy for Tencent has always been to be ambitious in games, but also to encourage creativity as much as you can.Ma: Of course. Creativity is always something we should focus on. We\u2019re always looking for the next big things in gameplay, in game genres. We\u2019re always trying to create new experiences. That\u2019s the only way to make this business successful.",

            "description": "A video said to showcase gameplay footage from a new Tencent-developed Need for Speed mobile game has leaked online.Need for Speed Mobile, as per a series of job listings spotted earlier this year, currently appears to be in development at Tencent's Timi Studio, which has also worked on the enormously popular Call of Duty Mobile and Pok\u00e9mon Unite.EA is yet to officially unveil a new Need for Speed mobile project, however, meaning the leaked footage - shared on the Need for Speed subreddit earlier today - is the first opportunity many will have had to see the game in action.Need for Speed Mobile is said to use a version of Need for Speed Heat's map.Said to have been taken from a recent test, the gameplay footage features around 45 seconds of open-world-style urban racing, switching between sun-drenched daytime driving and neon-hued night, all with a touch of 2019's Need for Speed Heat about it.In fact, according to the person responsible for the leak, Need for Speed Mobile - which is being made in Unreal Engine 4 - actually utilises Heat's full map, albeit with a number of details changed. It's also claimed the current build features no story and no cops, and only three available cars - the McLaren F1, the Lamborghini Aventador SVJR, and the Gallardo. Handling, according to the leaker, is similar to Need for Speed Edge and includes some drift boost effects.While Need for Speed Mobile is still yet to receive its official unveiling, EA has confirmed a new Criterion-developed entry in the long-running driving series is in the works for PC and consoles. Details on this second project are also fairly limited, but a flurry of recent reports have suggested it'll be skipping older consoles in favour of PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, will be set in a fictional Chicago, and will be launching later this year.",

The report shows that the total number of new Chinese songs reached 1.145 million in 2021, maintaining a year-on-year increase of 53.1%. This means that in 2021, a new song was launched every 27 seconds on average.As a music data research brand under Tencent Music Entertainment (TME), China\u2019s leading online music and audio entertainment platform, the institute is committed to building the most professional think-tank in the domestic music industry. It can rely on the company\u2019s diversified products and services and industry partners, its massive users and music data to count inventory comprehensively and get insight into the Chinese digital music industry.According to the institute\u2019s statistics, in 2021, the total broadcast volume of new Chinese songs increased by 9.3% compared with the previous year. Behind this vigorous development is an influx of new musicians. In 2021, the number of new singers reached a year-on-year increase of 41.2%, and it has become the norm that singer-songwriters create and release their music independently.The statistics of the white paper show that there are hundreds of musicians with an annual viewcount exceeding 500 million in 2021. Meanwhile, the number of new and old songs played over one million times in the five major genres including rap, R&B, electronic, rock and roll and folk increased by 4.5% compared with that of last year, among which rap and electronic music increased significantly.In terms of revenue, as of July 2021, the number of musicians on the platform with an average monthly income of over 10,000 yuan ($1,486) in 2020 increased by nine times this year.According to the white paper, the upsurge of investment in the NFT market in 2021 has also penetrated the music world, with world-renowned musicians testing the water continuously as well as leading music companies and platforms. With their music as NFT products, it is undoubtedly a supplement to musicians\u2019 current income. NFT transactions can also bring about more possibilities for musicians to enlarge their copyright income.SEE ALSO: China NFT Weekly: NFTs and the Music Industry",

Or perhaps you prefer the classics \u2014 say, Bo Dylan\u2019s \u201cLike a Roaring Stone\u201d? If you\u2019re a Chinese music fan, you may find yourself digging through copycat tracks with titles like these on a regular basis.China\u2019s biggest music streaming companies are accusing each other of plagiarism, each saying the other uses off-brand copies of popular artists signed to the other, with easily confused names and sometimes identical song titles.Cloud Village, a music streaming platform owned by internet conglomerate NetEase, said in a statement issued Wednesday that it had filed a lawsuit against Tencent Music Entertainment, accusing it of copyright violation and unfair competition. Tencent Music hasn\u2019t officially replied, but a senior executive wrote on WeChat that the company has filed a similar lawsuit against NetEase.\u201cWhile unfair competition happens from time to time in business, there are few sectors that have been as devastated as the domestic online music industry,\u201d NetEase wrote.Tencent and NetEase are the two largest music streamers in China, representing over 93% of the market share in 2020. But Cloud Village only accounted for 21%, far behind Tencent Music\u2019s 73%, according to Cloud Village\u2019s 2021 IPO prospectus. Tencent operates three music platforms: QQ Music, Kugou Music, and Kuwo Music.Starting in 2020, NetEase claims, Tencent\u2019s platforms have promoted songs mimicking NetEase\u2019s biggest hits. The company wrote that it has identified more than 5,000 such unauthorized covers, as well as pirated copies of original tracks.\u201cTo make it worse, some subsidiaries of Tencent Music have purposefully and systematically participated in the \u2018music laundering\u2019 industry, as all three of its platforms pirate original songs directly and churn out counterfeit versions with the same titles within a short amount of time,\u201d Cloud Village said.The copycats can be very easy to mistake for the originals. Suppose you want to hear \u201cI Want to Hold You in a Mediocre Life\u201d (Duo Xiang Zai Pingyong De Shenghuo Yongbao Ni), a hit by \u201cLao Fan from Next Door\u201d (Gebi Lao Fan) which is exclusive to NetEase. Search for it on Tencent-owned platform Kuwo, and you\u2019ll find a video of a live performance by Lao Fao, and then audio of a song with the same name by \u201cLao Pan From Next Door\u201d (Gebi Lao Pan). In China\u2019s ideographic script, the character for Pan is distinguished from Fan only by the addition of a mark at the bottom. Lao Pan\u2019s cover changes a few of the lyrics and keeps the melody of Lao Fan\u2019s version. Kuwo has originals of several other songs by Lao Fan.Online platforms have come under fire on antitrust grounds in recent years for using exclusivity deals as weapons against competitors. Antitrust regulators banned music platforms from signing new exclusivity deals in January.Tencent Music hasn\u2019t issued a formal response to NetEase\u2019s charges, but branding and public relations director Chen Mo accused NetEase of the same practices in a personal WeChat post, writing that his company has filed a similar lawsuit against the smaller rival. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to join the public spat, and are focusing on doing the right things that foster the development of the industry,\u201d he wrote.Chen pointed to the hit \u201cRoad in Bloom\u201d (Yi Lu Sheng Hua), by Wen Yixin. It\u2019s exclusive to Tencent \u2014 but if you search for it on Cloud Village, you\u2019ll find a song by the same title by \u201cYixin\u201d (using a different character for Yi, and an identical one for Xin).It\u2019s not clear how actively the platforms encourage copycat and pirate songs. Both companies allow musicians to upload songs to their platforms on their own, and are responsible for deleting pirate content. NetEase alleges that Tencent\u2019s platforms promoted copycat songs, and that they attempted to evade copyright claims by removing the songs from search results only in some cities when NetEase complained.Cloud Village also complained of copyright infringement of innovative features of its product, such as several interface designs and patented music networking functions.The two Chinese digital music heavyweights have been in a cutthroat race for users and popular musicians over the past years. In February 2021, Cloud Village slammed Tencent Music for \u201cpaying tribute\u201d to its app\u2019s song recommendation and networking features, which the latter claimed it has already acquired patents, while, in 2014, Tencent sued NetEase for allegedly infringing on the streaming rights of its licensed music resources.The dispute sparked heated discussions on China\u2019s microblogging platform Weibo. Netizens expressed discontent over a lack of supervision on counterfeit songs on both companies\u2019 music streaming products.\u201cI am on board about bringing this topic under the spotlight,\u201d Zhang Shuaikang, a nine-year user of Cloud Village\u2019s music app, told Sixth Tone. \u201cBut both of them aren\u2019t trying very hard to stop pirate music.\u201dEditor: David Cohen.(Header image: People Visual)",

ArrowRight Alibaba\u2019s shares plunged this week before state media clarified that the arrested Mister Ma was born in 1985, ruling out Alibaba founder Jack Ma, who was born in 1964. Alibaba\u2019s founder has kept a low profile since falling afoul of Beijing regulators in 2020.\u201cThe fact that the tech sector is on jitters over the recent detention of a guy named Ma \u2014 wholly unrelated to Jack or Pony \u2014 is more of a reflection of the lack of transparency and unpredictability in the regulatory system,\u201d said James Zimmerman, a Beijing-based lawyer and former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. (Pony Ma, the founder of Chinese Internet giant Tencent, shares the common surname.)The panic over Ma has cast a spotlight on the tense environment in China\u2019s tech industry, which just a few years ago was the darling of Beijing officials and international investors. Now stock prices have collapsed as onerous regulatory restrictions, covid lockdowns and U.S. sanctions combine to weigh on business.Advertisement\u201cI\u2019ve never experienced this degree of pessimism,\u201d said Duncan Clark, founder of Beijing-based consultancy BDA, who has been in the country since 1994. \u201cI think it\u2019s particularly grim because the fundamentals that have driven the sector are being undermined.\u201dClark said the role of the private sector was being questioned in the tech industry, as the government rolls out increasingly tighter regulation. Covid lockdown disruptions to supply chains have compounded business woes.Two executives in the high-tech hub Shenzhen, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said employees across the industry were eyeing the exits.\u201cPeople are afraid they will be laid off,\u201d one of them said. \u201cMorale is low.\u201dIn Shenzhen, Tencent\u2019s stock has lost more than half its value since February 2021, after the government announced much stricter regulations for children playing video games.AdvertisementAcross town, Huawei Technologies, the world\u2019s largest telecommunications gear supplier, reported its first-quarter revenue fell 14 percent from a year ago, with its smartphone business crippled by U.S. sanctions.Surveillance-camera maker Hikvision\u2019s stock fell the maximum 10 percent daily limit on Thursday after the Financial Times reported the Biden administration was planning to place human rights-related sanctions on the company.Share this article ShareAdding to the sense of unease in China has been a social media crackdown on several outspoken members of the business community.Last month, Wang Sicong, the son of Dalian Wanda Group founder Wang Jianlin, was banned from posting on the social media platform Weibo after complaining about frequent coronavirus tests and raising questions about whether a Chinese herbal medicine was effective in the treatment of covid. Wang had around 40 million followers, according to screenshots from before his suspension.AdvertisementThe head of research at China\u2019s Bank of Communications International, Hong Hao, who had 3 million Weibo followers, also saw his account suspended. He had made bearish economic comments about the effects of the ongoing Shanghai lockdown, including commenting on Twitter, \u201cShanghai: zero movement, zero GDP.\u201dThere was no official reason given for Wang and Hong\u2019s Weibo suspensions, and Weibo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Hong\u2019s Twitter bio now says he has left the bank.Jean Liu, president of China\u2019s equivalent of Uber, Didi Chuxing, and her father Liu Chuanzhi, founder of the world\u2019s largest personal-computer maker Lenovo, both removed their Weibo social media posts from public view in recent days. The two rank among China\u2019s most prominent entrepreneurs.As for the detained Mister Ma, state-run tabloid Global Times reported he was suspected of \u201ccolluding with outside forces and [trying] to subvert the state and split the country.\u201d The man was a director of hardware research at a tech company in Hangzhou, the city where Alibaba is headquartered.AdvertisementAlibaba\u2019s founder, Jack Ma, once a fixture at China business events, has made few public appearances since October 2020, when he criticized Beijing\u2019s financial regulators in a speech. His Internet finance juggernaut Ant Group was on track for the biggest IPO in history, but Beijing regulators halted it at the 11th hour and ordered Ma in for questioning.Zhou Jiangong, former CEO of the Chinese financial media outlet Yicai, wrote in an online essay that the Mister Ma incident reflected how the business community was on edge.\u201cThe market has become a frightened bird,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEntrepreneurs are full of fear.\u201d",

TiMi, Tencent\u2019s cash cow studio known for the mobile blockbuster Honor of Kings, began hiring in Los Angeles back in 2020. Last year, it added a base in Montreal.The Chinese gaming giants are venturing abroad at a time their home market comes under increasing regulatory scrutiny. Over the past few years, China has restricted playtime for minors, slowed regulatory approvals for games and imposed stricter rules on content.Such requirements have inevitably put a squeeze on gaming companies\u2019 bottom line. Many small studios, struggling to obtain regulatory licenses because they lack the financing or resources, have turned to foreign markets for growth.In 2021, China\u2019s gaming industry racked up nearly 300 billion yuan ($45 billion) in sales revenue, up 6.4% year-on-year, though the growth rate was down 15% compared to the year before.Given the domestic challenges, it\u2019s no surprise that the country\u2019s giants are seeking new avenues for growth. NetEase\u2019s new U.S.-based studio, called Jackalope Games, is led by Jack Emmert, a veteran of massively multiplayer online role-playing games who worked on titles including City of Heroes, Neverwinter, Star Trek Online and DC Universe Online.The studio will operate independently and maintain creative autonomy in its game development and publishing, NetEase said. It will work on both PC and console games and be hiring globally, though it didn\u2019t say how many people it will be recruiting.",

            "description": "There\u2019s been a growing trend over the past couple of years of music streaming services becoming agnostic music distributors.This arguably started with SoundCloud in 2019, when it launched a distribution feature that enabled artists to distribute their music to a range of rival streaming services. The following year, it launched a marketing and distribution platform for \u201cserious artists who want to take their career to the next level\u201d.And just last month, ByteDance-owned viral video app TikTok launched its own promotion and music distribution platform, called SoundOn.Now, Tencent Music Entertainment, the owner of China\u2019s largest music streaming services, has become one of the industry\u2019s newest global music distributors.TME\u2019s new service, dubbed \u201cOne-Click For All\u201d, enables independent musicians registered to its Tencent Musician Platform to distribute their music to over 150 platforms globally, including Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music and others.The Tencent Musician Platform is an indie artist initiative previously known as \u2018Tencent Musician Program\u2019. It was launched in 2017, and by the end of 2021, the number of registered musicians on the program reached more than 300,000.Tencent Music, majority owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings, runs music apps in China including its flagship music platform QQ Music, as well as Kugou, Kuwo, plus online karaoke service, WeSing.Tencent Music Entertainment\u2019s expansion into the global distribution business comes four years after rival Spotify started offering artists direct distribution deals (including paying out advances) itself back in 2018. It then abandoned the plan.Spotify also launched its own DIY distribution service in 2018, only to suddenly axe the service just a few months later.Artists signed up to Tencent Musician Platform were already able to distribute their music to TME\u2019s own music apps.TME revealed in December that over the course of 2021, more than 2.1 million songs from independent artists were distributed through the Tencent Musician Platform.To date, TME says that it has successfully distributed and promoted more than 150,000 songs to overseas platforms.TME says that One-Click For All\u2019s distribution process \u2013 the time it takes between uploading a track to seeing it appear on streaming services \u2013 takes seven working days to complete.Artists will receive income generated from overseas distribution quarterly, and TME says that artists will be paid 70% of those royalties.TME will also provide musicians with an International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) for free.The official unveiling of TME\u2019s global distro service for indie artists follows its partnership with Apple Music at the end of 2021, which allowed record labels and artists using its TME Music Cloud service to distribute their music to Apple Music.Tencent cites musicians such as Liu Shuang, Akini JING, Joysaaaa and SARRA as having \u201cbeen promoted to international audiences\u201d through Apple Music since then.It also cites tracks by independent Chinese artists like Piu Piu Piu by Pin Yin Shi and Wild Motor by Guo Gaoming, as having \u201cwon over one million views on YouTube\u201d.In TME\u2019s annual report for 2021, recently filed by on the SEC, the publicly-traded firm explains that the Tencent Musician Platform is an online service \u201cfor selected aspiring artists to upload original music\u201d to its platform.TME says that \u201cCultivating original works and enriching the indie musician ecosystem through [its] Tencent Musician Platform is another key source of our content differentiation\u201d.In addition to music distribution, resources offered to musicians selected to join its independent artist program include song production, domestic and overseas promotion, artist and repertoire development, performance resources, copyright protection, career training and incentive plans.In 2021, TME launched what it calls \u201can upgraded 100 Million Yuan (approx $15m) Incentive Plan\u201d for indie artists, which, it says \u201cincentivizes eligible musicians to collaborate with us in music creation\u201d, as well as \u201cto provide comprehensive incentive mechanisms to help high-quality content and artists gain exposure across our platforms\u201d.The company adds that it has \u201calso developed a proprietary process of matching repertoire with suitable singers and producers for promotion on multiple TME and external platforms\u201d.Tencent Music reached 76.2 million paying users in Q4 (ended December 31, 2021), up by 36.1% year-over-year.\u201cLeveraging our proprietary tools and technologies, we are pleased to see our investment in original music production starting to pay off, as well as an increasing number of indie musicians finding a home on our Tencent Musician Platform.\u201d Cussion Pang, TMEIn a statement published with TME\u2019s Q4 financial update, Executive Chairman Cussion Pang, said: \u201cLeveraging our proprietary tools and technologies, we are pleased to see our investment in original music production starting to pay off, as well as an increasing number of indie musicians finding a home on our Tencent Musician Platform.\u201cWith broad capabilities across the content value chain, we will continuously expand content production, licensing, operation, promotion, and monetization efforts to augment the scale and fortify the quality and competitiveness of our music catalog.\u201dMusic Business Worldwide",

REUTERS/Aly Song Acquire Licensing RightsHONG KONG, April 25 (Reuters) - Chinese video game streaming site Huya (HUYA.N) has started laying off staff, three sources close to the matter said, as more of the country's technology companies scale back after a bruising regulatory crackdown.Huya, which is controlled by Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) and was once part of a plan the Chinese gaming giant had to create China\u2019s answer to U.S. platform Twitch, intends to cut hundreds of staff, said the sources, who declined to be named because they are not permitted to speak to the media.The company's Nimo TV unit, which launched in 2018 as an international version of Huya, is most heavily affected with large staff cuts already implemented.Huya, which is one of China's largest video streaming platforms alongside rival DouYu , had 2,075 employees in 2020, according to its latest annual report.\"Given the changing market conditions, Nimo TV has made some strategic adjustments and optimisations for business, and will allocate resources to key regions in the future,\" a Huya spokesperson said, declining to comment about layoffs in other parts of Huya's business.Tencent's plan to merge Huya and DouYu to create a $10 billion video game streaming behemoth was blocked by Beijing last year on antitrust grounds as part of a regulatory crackdown.Since then, Chinese regulators have ramped up oversight of the livestreaming industry and Tencent this month shut its in-house video game streaming arm Penguin Esports.Huya's staff cuts were first reported by local media outlets such as Tech Planet, which said that Huya\u2019s biggest rival DouYu is also laying off many employees.Douyu told Reuters that it is not currently conducting large-scale layoffs but making normal personnel adjustments to optimise resources.Other Chinese tech giants, including Alibaba and Tencent, have been cutting staff after new regulations banned some of their old business practices and limited growth opportunities.Chinese social e-commerce app Xiaohongshu, known as China's answer to Instagram, last week said it had cut about 9% of its workforce. read moreReporting by Josh Ye Editing by Brenda Goh and David GoodmanOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

I hope he\u2019s got thick enough skin, and he\u2019s been an executive in the business way longer than I have, but I was just like \u2018man, I don\u2019t want to do business with a company like that, with a government like that.'\u201dNotice: To display this embed please allow the use of Functional Cookies in Cookie Preferences.Later in the podcast, as Moriarty and Jaffe discussed the increase in money being invested in studios across the industry, Jaffe elaborated on some of the reasons why he turned down the Tencent deal.\u201cStop killing people,\u201d he said. \u201cAgain, people will be like, \u2018America\u2019s hands aren\u2019t clean\u2019, no they are not clean at all but we\u2019re also not, you know, we all have a system that if we actually gave a shit, we could change it.\u201cIn China, you just get picked up off the street if you go online and say something bad about the police or the government or anything and who knows when they\u2019ll see you again.

            "description": "For years, China has left a loophole open for people to access unauthorized video games, but it\u2019s ready to close it.Many foreign titles lack a Chinese publishing partner like Tencent to help them obtain the government-issued license needed to operate in the country, so players normally rely on an \u201caccelerator\u201d to reduce delays of overseas-hosted games.On Wednesday, Tencent, the world\u2019s largest online gaming company, announced it will terminate its gaming booster that allows users to play overseas games. Though not explicitly said in the notice, some users see the decision as the authorities\u2019 stepping up to limit access to foreign gameplay. Tencent\u2019s rival NetEase also runs a similar service, which is still operating.The other signal of enhanced control came on Friday when China\u2019s National Radio and Television Administration, the regulator granting video games licenses, said platforms will be \u201cstrictly prohibited\u201d from livestreaming games that have not been authorized by the government. Platforms, including their individual and business accounts, should gain approval before broadcasting overseas games or matches, the notice said.This will substantially shrink the number of games that China\u2019s livestreaming hosts can discuss, which could put many of them out of work, as China has slowed down the approval process for new games over the last few years. Many foreign titles may not be officially available in China, but a big market exists where commentary and matches of blockbuster international games are featured on the country\u2019s live broadcasting platforms like Huya and Douyu.The government has issued similar warnings in the past. For instance, in 2016, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, which partakes in gaming regulation but doesn\u2019t issue licenses, mentioned in a blanket regulation for \u201cinternet performances\u201d that platforms \u201cshould not\u201d include commentary on unlicensed games, less strong wording compared to the latest document.",

            "description": "Although China has resumed license approvals for video games, the country\u2019s strict new regulatory environment and gaming content censorship still prohibits foreign gamers.Tencent, the world\u2019s largest gaming company, will also be suspending its game speed boosting apps and close access to foreign games starting in June.Experts foresee a trend whereby more foreign companies will scale back their China ambitions despite how tempting the market is.In the world\u2019s largest gaming market, China, licenses for new video games were traditionally issued every month. That trend however stalled in July last year when Chinese authorities suspended the licensing of new games, be it foreign-owned or domestic. Within the same period, China announced that it would be forbidding those under the age of 18 from playing video games for more than three hours a week.Fast forward to this year, the Chinese authority, according to the National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA), has resumed granting new video game licenses at the start of this month. While the latest approval of the 45 licenses marked the end of the nine-month suspension, the Chinese gaming industry is still under intense scrutiny.The recent hiatus is not the first isolated incident for the gaming sector in China, In 2018, the Chinese authorities also stopped approving new video game titles over a nine-month period. Reuters then reported that it was part of an overhaul of the regulatory bodies overseeing the sector.HOW TENCENT PLANS TO TACKLE CHILD GAMING ADDICTION IN CHINAIn January this year, Chinese video platform Bilibili said it will ban live-streaming of more than 60 video games, including the popular Grand Theft Auto (GTA) series and The Witcher 3 to comply with regulatory guidelines. The live-streaming unit of Bilibili said that the decision to ban live-streaming of these games and others such as Heart of Iron, Rainbow Six Siege and the World of Tanks had been made to comply with guidelines from the Ministry of Culture and other authorities, which regard these titles as unfit for public broadcasting.Whether or not history is repeating itself, the local gaming sector that has been hit by regulations since last year, is no longer an easy game for any players, domestic or foreign.Can the world\u2019s largest game comply with China?Three days ago, China tech giant Tencent, which is also the world\u2019s largest gaming company, announced that they are closing down their games speed booster apps, a platform that provides Chinese gamers with access to foreign games. While the move may not be widely accepted by many, it is an expected one due to an increased scrutiny within the sector.For starters, games in China are carefully examined and certified by regulators as to whether they are suitable for the Chinese audience. Because the process is strict, many games failed to obtain licenses. Prior to the suspension, the NPPA approved 76 imported games in 2021, which is even fewer than the 97 approved in 2020 and the 180 approved in 2019.When they finally resumed handing out licenses, the NPPA approved a total of 45 titles from companies such as Seasun Entertainment, Lilith Games and XD on the list. Foreign titles remained distant. That is where game booster apps come into play\u2013 a loophole for gamers in mainland China to access foreign games and play online with international players.Unfortunately, with the intense scrutiny by the Chinese regulators, gaming companies like Tencent are under immense pressure to comply with the policies and restrict players from accessing unapproved titles.That said, the move to block foreign games would mean that game developers who had relied on these game booster services to reach the Chinese audience will be impacted by the move. Prior to this, Tencent was also suspended from launching new games in December of last year after ostensibly violating user data protection rights, although the specifics of this violation were never outlined.Overall, the country\u2019s video games market in 2021 recorded its slowest revenue growth in three years. while the number of players stagnated, based on an industry report. Data by the Game Publishing Committee (GPC) of the China Audio-Video and Digital Publishing Association, the industry\u2019s gross sales revenue grew a mere 6.4% in 2021 from a year ago, a sharp reduction from last year\u2019s 20.7% growth.Even the number of gamers in China was almost stagnant, with the number of gamers rising by just 0.22% to 66.6 million gamers in 2021, compared to the 3.7% growth in 2020. Employment in the industry has also been affected with video game creators and designers experiencing a huge pay cut, with some even being laid off.",

            "description": "Tencent is altering one of its services in a way that will prevent gamers based in China from playing online games from overseas.While the Chinese government approves which titles are officially released and operated in China, gamers do find ways to access online games hosted on foreign servers. However, local internet speeds can often be too slow to enable them to play.Tencent, as well as other Chinese internet firms such as NetEase, offers network acceleration tools that improve internet speeds in order to allow gamers the chance to access these foreign games.Reuters now reports that Tencent has announced an update to one such app that will only support games officially operating in China. The update will launch on May 31, after which users will be unable to access foreign games.The company did not provide comment on why it was making these changes, but the move follows several measures by the Chinese government to both control the type of games released in China and cut down on the time people, especially children and teenagers, spend playing video games.Earlier this week, Chinese regulators finally ended a nine-month freeze on new game approvals, officially granting a licence to release in China to just 45 games -- many of which were developed domestically.The freeze was a factor in the shutting down of over 14,000 development studios in China.This follows a nine-month freeze on approvals in 2018 while the government made changes to the regulations process and the body that oversees it. More restrictions were made last year as China applied tighter rules around depictions of religion, morality and sexuality.Last summer, the government limited the time minors spend playing video games to just three hours per week, as well as introducing spending caps.Tencent has been particularly active in this area, introducing its own restrictions that align with the government's clampdown on gaming.Last year, it added facial recognition technology to prevent children from logging into online games between 10pm and 8am. It has also previously raised the minimum age for its \"digital lock\" measures from 13 years old to 16, and implemented time limits for young players in flagship title Honor of Kings.",

            "description": "China\u2019s Tencent decided to shut down its video game streaming platform Penguin Esports, citing a change in business strategy.The Chinese authorities are also mulling an overhaul of Tencent\u2019s payments arm.Tencent is also being targeted in China\u2019s latest campaign to rein in the potential abuse of algorithms by internet giants.Most tech giants in China would agree that 2021 could go down as one of the toughest years for Chinese technology firms as Beijing moved to exert control over the sector that was once freewheeling. Almost overnight, China\u2019s anti-monopoly bureaucrats became a force feared by Big Tech, as they issued hefty fines for deals struck without official approval. While the situation was expected to largely subside this year, tech giants like Tencent Holdings are still feeling the brunt \u2014 with no signs of slowing down.To recall, the Chinese government had never been a naysayer when it comes to merger deals in the country\u2019s technology sector\u2013until July 2021, when the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) blocked Tencent\u2019s plan to merge Douyu and Huya, two video game live-streaming websites it controls.When that happened, experts reckon that the decision by Beijing sends a strong signal\u2013that the Chinese authorities are no longer shy to act on antitrust issues. With that comes the end of the freewheeling era for Big Tech companies in China, and thereon, being able to engage in aggressive merger and acquisition activity to achieve market dominance would be a challenge.After all, the merger would have created a video game streaming behemoth worth more than US$10 billion and that would allow Tencent to take on Amazon\u2019s Twitch. Therefore, stalling that to happen simply sets a precedent for the country\u2019s internet industry. Based on the regulatory ruling published on the same day the decision were made, SAMR said that Huya and Douyu\u2019s combined market share in the video game live-streaming industry would be over 70% if the merger went ahead.That would simply give Tencent, the world\u2019s biggest games publisher, a dominant role in the gaming industry, especially locally. Few days prior to stalling the deal, SAMR dished out 22 fines of half a million yuan each to the country\u2019s Big Tech firms, citing violations of \u2018concentration of business operators\u2019 with respect to a series of mergers and acquisitions deals closed in the last decade.Besides Tencent, the companies fined include Alibaba and Didi. Fast forward nine months later, Tencent announced that it is shutting down its video game streaming platform Penguin Esports on June 7, citing a change of business strategy.A lot like Amazon\u2019s Twitch, Tencent\u2019s Penguin Esports hosts livestreams of professional gaming tournaments and other video game-related content. As one of the world\u2019s largest online gaming players that were aggressively pushing into the area of professional gaming, also known as e-sports, Tencent saw it as a potential new revenue stream.US\u2019 \u2018NOTORIOUS MARKETS\u2019 LIST EXPLAINED: WHY ARE CHINESE COMPANIES LIKE ALIBABA, TENCENT IN IT?Hence, when Tencent proposed merging Huya and DouYu\u2013a plan that would have valued the new company at around US$6 billion at the time\u2013the plan was to move its Penguin Esports brand under the combined entity. Unfortunately, regulators have been tightening gaming regulations in China to protect younger users and that has been taxing for Tencent, who reported its slowest quarterly revenue growth on record in the fourth quarter of last year.China\u2019s not slowing down \u2014 not for Tencent at leastUntil recently, Tencent, China\u2019s social media and video game behemoth, has been largely unscathed by Beijing\u2019s sweeping crackdown on big internet platforms that began in late 2020. Then actions began unfolding when in 2021, a Tencent subsidiary, Tencent Music Entertainment Group, was stripped of its exclusive rights to some music labels.That was then followed by the failed merger attempt between its two videogame streaming platforms. Yet, for expects, Tencent as a group and WeChat, its crown jewel, have avoided substantial reprimands and penalties from Chinese authorities. Until last June, when the local government published a draft amendment to its anti-money-laundering law that sought to broaden and deepen the scope of its regulations.The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) basically wants nonbank payment companies to have obligations to detect and prevent money laundering, just like banks and other financial institutions. The amendment also meant companies can be fined for every violation count\u2014meaning fines could add up to large sums\u2014and that sort of gives PBOC more power and discretion to levy fines in their jurisdictions.In short, the changes raise the stakes for mobile-payment platforms like Tencent\u2019s WeChat Pay and its archrival Alipay, simply because of the massive volume of financial transactions that they facilitate. While Tenpay Payment Technology Co, the licensed entity that runs WeChat Pay, was previously hit with small fines that typically were less than 10 million yuan, the new fines are likely to be far higher, because China is apparently seeking to bring its anti-money-laundering enforcement up to international standards.Now, besides Ant\u2019s Alipay, Tencent too are required to set up financial holding companies\u2014overseen by the PBOC\u2014that encompass all of their licensed financial operations. While Ant has been working with regulators to turn itself into a financial-holding company that would include all its payment, banking, insurance, credit-scoring, fund management and other licensed activities, for Tencent however, it is more nuanced and complex.Nevertheless, there have been indications that Tencent may be required to include WeChat Pay in a newly created financial holding company. According to Bloomberg\u2019s report from March, it would be part of an overhaul that may necessitate a new license for the ubiquitous mobile payments service.From gaming, to payments and now algorithms?Including other tech giants in China, Tencent too will be investigated by China\u2019s regulators on the potential abuse of algorithms. This is a part of the Cyberspace Administration of China\u2019s (CAC) move on overseeing the way social media platforms serve up ads and content to hook users.In a statement last Friday, the internet watchdog said it will conduct on-site inspections of firms and ask them to submit their various services for review. Without naming any, CAC said large-scale websites, platforms, and products with big influence will be targeted. The campaign is simply an effort to implement the rules unveiled last August to govern the industry\u2019s use of algorithms to surface content for users.The rule that came into effect last month proposes far-reaching restrictions on content algorithms to forbid practices that encourage online addiction, as well as any activities that endanger national security or disrupt social order. Fortunately, companies including ByteDance and Tencent have since then, made changes to their products by offering users a way to opt-out of AI recommendations on apps like Douyin and WeChat.While most would have thought the worst may have been over for Big Tech in China, experts from Lawfare Institute in Cooperation reckon that regulators are likely to continue pursuing enforcement actions against Chinese technology companies into the foreseeable future.As it is, in August 2021, China\u2019s State Council and Communist Party Central Committee passed a five-year plan promising to tackle monopolies, review regulations related to the digital economy and address \u201cforeign-related rule of law.\u201d The plan, in addition to statements from the SAMR\u2019s agency head promising strengthened antitrust enforcement in 2022, points to another difficult year for China\u2019s tech giants.",

This was comprised of a salary of CNY7.3 million (USD1.1 million), a bonus of CNY35.5 million, retirement plan contributions of CNY110,000 (USD17,296) and a director's fee of CNY1.1 million.While President Martin Lau received CNY323 million (USD50.7 million), including CNY291.8 million in equity compensation and a bonus of CNY23 million. This was much less than the CNY427.7 million he received in 2020.Overall, payouts to the board of directors tumbled 23.5 percent last year from the year before to CNY388 million (USD61 million), the report said. Iain Ferguson Bruce's remuneration slumped 58.3 percent to CNY1.9 million (USD298,000). But other board members were given a pay rise, with Ke Yang's salary increasing by 37.8 percent and that of Ian Charles Stone, Li Dongsheng and Yang Shaoxin by between 18 percent and 24 percent.Tencent is adapting to the new environment by optimizing costs, increasing efficiency and sharpening focus on key strategic areas for sustainable long-term growth, Lau said last month. There is a fundamental shift taking place in the industry from growth at all costs to a more value-based, efficiency-based and sustainable growth model, he added.The internet giant\u2019s profit nudged up 1 percent last year from the year before to CNY123.7 billion (USD19.4 billion), the smallest profit increase in nearly a decade, according to its earnings report.

Using a computer program, he made it so the reflection of the stage could be seen in the star's twinkling eyes. Such an effect aroused the resonance of many fans during the live broadcast of the concert.The concert quickly began trending on Chinese mainland's social media, with many netizens expressing surprise at the improved visual quality of the video, in which they could even see details such as Cheung's individual strands of hair and the silhouette of his face under the dim lighting. Many netizens remarked that it was like they had \"traveled back to the year 2000.\"With the development of digital technologies such as 5G and AI, the ultra-high-definition video technology has become an important driving force for the rapid development of China's ultra-high-definition video industry.According to a plan jointly issued by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and other authorities, by 2022 the total value of the ultra-high-definition video industry will exceed 4 trillion yuan ($629 billion), and the production of ultra-high-definition content will exceed 30,000 hours annually.Born on September 12, 1956, Cheung was one of the leading pioneers who shaped the identity of Cantopop during the 1980s. On April 1, 2003, he leapt to his death from the 24th floor of a hotel in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) at the age of 46. The news sent shock waves of grief among fans across China and many other countries in Asia, many of whom still leave flowers outside the building every year to pay their respects to the late star. In his 26-year career from 1977 until his death, Cheung released over 40 music albums and starred in 56 films.",

NFT trading is known as digital collection in China and most trading via Chinese NFT platforms is completed in Chinese yuan, instead of the crypto currency used in foreign NFT trading platforms.In response, WeChat said on Wednesday the move was aimed at reining in speculation and second-hand NFT trading by WeChat accounts and mini programs to fend off risks associated with crypto currency trading, news website 21jingji.com reported.Under the rectification, WeChat public accounts that support primary NFT trading shall provide proof of cooperation with blockchain firms that have been put on record with the Cyberspace Administration of China. Second-hand trading is totally banned at the WeChat platform.\"If any bypass or counter moves are detected, the accounts may be banned or removed based on the extent of the violation,\" WeChat said, adding that the platform will closely follow relevant regulation to adjust and improve rules.According to a report by news website jiemian.com, most platforms were banned for being \"involved in publishing and spreading of businesses for which they did not have certificates.\" Certain platforms were banned for \"alleged fraud.\" WeChat also sent notifications to some NFT platforms in recent days, requiring them to provide certificates by April 1. Otherwise, those platforms may also be blocked.Wang Peng, an assistant professor at the Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence at Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Wednesday that Tencent's decision could be regarded as \"a preventive action\" to guard against potential financial risks.\"In China, there's no clear policy regulating this industry, which has gained momentum this year. But the sector has a mixture of NFT tokens of genuine value and fraud cases. How a leading tech firm like Tencent deals with such chaos may also shed light on how NFTs can be regulated in China in the future,\" Wang said.In 2021, Chinese regulators moved to ban Bitcoin mining after outlawing cryptocurrency trading in 2017.",

Players also speculated an incoming mobile version after Tencent released its fourth quarterly earnings call, which included a project with Ubisoft.Now, leakers are saying that a trailer is on its way, most likely early next month. It will outline the details of Rainbow Six Siege Mobile, something that's still somewhat of a mystery.When is Rainbow Six Siege Mobile coming out?Mobile gamers can expect to play Rainbow Six Siege in 2023. The Ubisoft project announced in Tencent's earnings call that the timeline for this unnamed game was next year.What will Rainbow Six Siege Mobile gameplay be like?It's currently unclear what the mobile version will entail but it's most likely going to be quite similar to the PC version.Many shooters have come to mobile in the past few years, including Call of Duty and Apex Legends. Call of Duty: Warzone was also recently announced for mobile devices. Most of the mobile versions have had similar gameplay to the original versions albeit with some changes to fit the new format.\"It will be a mobile game that Siege fans will love,\" another insider said to eXputer.",

But technology platforms like Tencent's WeChat are taking a cautious approach to prevent speculation with NFTs.Tencent's WeChat has suspended some accounts associated with so-called non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and clarified the rules around these digital collectibles.NFTs are effectively digital tokens such as artwork that have boomed in popularity with some selling for several millions of dollars. They're usually based on a blockchain platform, mainly Ethereum, with people paying for the tokens in cryptocurrencies.But China has taken a tough stance on digital currencies, banning the trading of them in the country. NFTs in China are not bought with cryptocurrencies. Instead, people pay with the Chinese yuan. They're also not built on a blockchain like Ethereum. Instead they are built on other blockchains that the regulators have oversight of.However, there is no regulation of NFTs yet in the country. Users can buy these digital collectibles from a marketplace but secondary trading is heavily restricted. Because NFTs can be speculative, technology companies are taking a cautious approach so as not to get on the wrong side of any upcoming regulation.Tencent said it has \"rectified\" public accounts on WeChat in order to prevent the risk of speculation in digital currency transactions.",

            "description": "Tencent Music (TME) continues to grow the number of people who are paying for streaming subscriptions or music downloads from its services in China.The company ended 2021 with 76.2 million \u2018online music paying users\u2019, up by 36.1% year-on-year, according to its financial results. It added five million paying users in the final quarter of 2021 alone.However, it\u2019s not all good news. In Q4, TME\u2019s overall revenues were RMB 7.61bn ($1.19bn), down 8.7% year-on-year. That\u2019s despite 4.3% growth for its online music revenues, including 23.5% growth for music subscriptions specifically \u2013 to RMB 1.95bn ($306m).What pulled the overall figures down was TME\u2019s other key business segment: social entertainment services (largely karaoke and livestreaming). Those revenues fell by 15.2% year-on-year to RMB 4.73bn ($742m), and since social entertainment is nearly two thirds of the company\u2019s business, that caused the overall decline.TME, understandably, stressed the positive. Its full-year revenues in 2021 were up by 7.2% to RMB 31.24bn ($4.9bn), including 22.7% growth for online music services to RMB 11.47bn ($1.8bn). Subscriptions accounted for RMB 7.33bn ($1.15bn) of that, and grew by 31.9% year-on-year.In his official statements accompanying the financials, TME\u2019s executive chairman Cussion Pang blamed \u201cincreasing competition and changing macro environment\u201d for the Q4 drop in social entertainment revenues.Other stats worth knowing about Tencent Music\u2019s business: it ended 2021 with 615 million monthly active users of its online music services, down from 622 million the year before. The 76.2 million paying users of those services means that TME\u2019s conversion rate is now 12.4% \u2013 a big step up from 9% a year ago.Also watch what TME is doing with original (exclusive) music and independent musicians. In the company\u2019s earnings call, Pang talked about its work on AI-powered hit-spotting tools for example.\u201cOur proprietary predictive model enables forecasting and data mining for songs with blockbuster potential by determining intricate user preferences and using melody, lyrics, voice and rhythms, which in turn makes original song production more cost effective,\u201d he said. One track identified in this way, \u2018Lonely City\u2019, did nearly 1bn streams in Q4 alone.TME also now has 300,000 independent musicians uploading to its services through its Tencent Musician arm, and is working with other companies \u201cin the broader Tencent ecosystem\u201d (i.e. subsidiaries and firms it has invested in) to create original tracks. 117 of those were released in 2021 based on games, animation, books and TV shows.Also of interest: TME recently launched TMELAND, a music-focused virtual world, holding an online music festival there on New Year\u2019s Eve. The company plans to partner with artists to create bespoke environments for their virtual concerts \u2013 including ones where they perform as avatars \u2013 while also applying TMELAND to the company\u2019s karaoke business.The metaverse is also extending into TME\u2019s streaming services. \u201cLooking ahead into 2022, QQ Music will see an upgrade with a metaverse feature, where user will have its own individual room where you can put your own music into that virtual room, friends can come and visit, you can listen to the music together, you could play instruments together,\u201d chief strategy officer Tony Yip told analysts.\u201cAnd for artists, we will be also opening kind of virtual showrooms for these partnering artists to display all of their albums in this virtual world, and users can come into this virtual showroom, listen to all their audio music under different audio effects.\u201dThere are even experiments splicing music with virtual pets: M-PETS on TME\u2019s QQ Music service, and Music Elf on its Kugou Music service \u201cto provide companionship to our music users\u201d. A niche? TME said these have \u201calready been adopted by millions of users\u201d.",

These partly offset declines in revenue seen by Moonlight Blade Mobile and Peacekeeper Elite, the repurposed PUBG Mobile themed around the Chinese military.The company also gave insight into the effect of various measures it has taken to reduce the time young people spend playing its games, driven in no small part by new government regulations brought in last year.Total playing time for minors was down 88% year-on-year, meaning young people accounted for 0.9% of the total time spent playing Tencent's domestic games.Total grossing receipts from minors was down 73% year-on-year, accounting for 1.5% of all grossing receipts from domestic games.Elsewhere, Tencent claimed it developed and/or operated five of the ten most played mobile games in the world last year, and highlighted League of Legends-based Netflix animated series as Arcane as another key success for its games business. It is currently looking into developing new games, animated series and movies based on Honor of Kings.Another highlight was Pokemon Unite, which passed 50 million downloads by December 2021.Tencent also reported its results for the three months ended December 31, 2021, the fourth and final quarter of its fiscal year.Total revenues rose 8% year-on-year to RMB 144.2 billion ($22.6 billion), with Reuters reporting this is the slowest quarterly growth since the company went public in 2004.This is partly down to decreases in operating profit -- down 13% to RMB 33.2 billion ($5.2 billion) -- and quarterly profit -- down 25% to RMB 25.8 billion ($4 billion).Domestic games revenues for the quarter remained relatively flat at RMB29.6 billion ($4.6 billion, up 1% year-on-year).Meanwhile, international games revenues rose 34% to RMB 13.2 billion ($2.1 billion). This was attributed partly to the launch of new content for Valorant and Clash Royale.\"2021 was a challenging year, in which we embraced changes and implemented certain measures that reinforced the Company's long-term sustainability, but had the effect of slowing our revenue growth,\" said chairman and CEO Ma Huateng.\"Despite financial headwinds, we continued to make strategic headway, including driving widespread adoption of our enterprise software and productivity tools, increasing content creation and consumption in our video accounts, and expanding our international games business.\"Tencent owns several major games businesses around the world, including Riot Games, Sumo Group, Turtle Rock Studios, Sharkmob, Funcom, Wake Up Interactive, and Leyou (which in turn owns Athlon Games, Digital Extremes and Splash Damage).It also holds stakes in Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft, Supercell, Roblox, Epic Games, Netmarble, Paradox Interactive, Remedy Entertainment, Dontnod Entertainment, Bloober Team and Playtonic Games.Most recently, it became a majority investor in Rime developer Tequila Works, took minority stakes in Riffraff Games (formerly Studio MayDay) and Offworld Industries, and acquired 1C Entertainment and Improbable's Inflexion studio.At the tail end of last year, it launched a new publishing label, Level Infinite.",

            "description": "Tencent (TCEHY -0.22%) was once considered a promising play on China's booming tech sector. The tech giant owned China's largest mobile messaging platform, WeChat, and it locked in those users with integrated Mini Programs that eliminated the need for traditional apps. It's also the largest video game publisher in the world.Tencent also owns China's third-largest cloud infrastructure platform, its leading streaming music and video platforms, and a long list of other smaller apps. Its digital payment platform, WeChat Pay, also shares a near-duopoly in that booming market with Ant Group's Alipay.Those growth engines are all impressive, but Tencent's stock price has declined a staggering 40% over the past 12 months and wiped out nearly all of its gains from the past two years. The main cause of that steep decline was China's crackdown on its top tech stocks -- which included unpredictable probes, fines, and restrictions on new investments and acquisitions. The government's temporary suspension of new video game approvals and a tightening of playtime restrictions for minors also exacerbated the pain.However, Tencent and other Chinese tech stocks recently rallied after the Chinese government said it would wrap up its regulatory crackdown, support overseas listings for Chinese companies, and work with U.S. regulators to address auditing and delisting concerns for Chinese ADRs. That sounds like good news for Tencent, but investors should review these three red flags before scooping up shares of its beaten-down stock.1. Another big fine could be loomingTencent hasn't been hit by a massive antitrust fine comparable to the record $2.75 billion fine against Alibaba (BABA -1.02%) -- yet. Instead, it was slapped with much lower fines related to some previous deals and was forced to abandon its planned merger of Huya (HUYA -5.34%) and DouYu (DOYU -4.45%) to create China's largest video game streaming platform.However, The Wall Street Journal recently claimed Tencent could be fined at least a few hundred million yuan for money laundering violations on WeChat Pay. That fine probably wouldn't be too meaningful compared to Tencent's projected revenue of 566.65 billion yuan ($89 billion) this year, but it could curb WeChat Pay's future growth with fresh restrictions.That wouldn't be surprising, since the Chinese government also indefinitely postponed Ant Group's IPO amid concerns that the Alibaba-backed fintech company could overpower the country's state-backed banks.2. More regulatory red tape in the U.S.Over the past year, the main regulatory headwind for Tencent in the U.S. was the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) threat to delist shares of Chinese companies that didn't comply with tighter auditing standards. Tencent only trades on the pink sheets in the U.S., but the SEC order could also delist over-the-counter (OTC) Chinese stocks.However, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also recently added Tencent's WeChat and ByteDance's TikTok to a new antitrust bill that also covers U.S. internet tech giants like Apple, Amazon, Alphabet's Google, and Meta Platforms' Facebook.WeChat doesn't have as much exposure to the U.S. market as TikTok, but Tencent still owns stakes in U.S. companies like Activision Blizzard, Tesla, and Snap. The FTC's tighter antitrust rules could curb its ability to expand that investment portfolio, which has boosted its profits in recent years.3. The resurgence of COVID-19 in ChinaChina recently experienced its worst surge in new COVID-19 cases in two years. That rapid outbreak has resulted in the lockdowns of several major cities, including Tencent's hometown of Shenzhen.New lockdowns might generate tailwinds for Tencent's domestic gaming business, which accounted for 24% of its revenue last quarter. But a resurgent pandemic could also generate headwinds for its advertising business, which brought in 16% of its revenue. Those headwinds could easily overwhelm the tailwinds and throttle Tencent's near-term growth.Is Tencent's stock still worth buying?Analysts expect Tencent's revenue to grow 18% in 2021 and 15% in 2022. They expect its earnings per share to dip slightly in both years as it expands its lower-margin cloud and fintech businesses while grappling with the slowing growth of its higher-margin video game business.Tencent's stock looks reasonably valued at 20 times forward earnings and five times next year's sales, but it probably won't command a higher premium until the regulatory headwinds wane and China contains its latest COVID-19 crisis. Therefore, I'd stay far away from Tencent -- as well as most other Chinese tech stocks -- until all those issues are resolved.",

Tencent also failed to fully comply with rules around checking the identity of merchants and individuals as well as the source of their funds, the newspaper said.Tencent was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC Monday.Shares in the tech firm fell nearly 10% to close at 331.80 Hong Kong dollars ($42.38), their lowest closing level since Dec. 5, 2019.Since a record high close of 766.50 Hong Kong dollars in January 2021, Tencent shares have shed around 56%, wiping off more than $500 billion of value off the company.The WSJ report comes after more than a year of intense regulatory tightening by Beijing on the country's technology sector that has sought to rein in the power and stamp out some of the alleged bad behaviors of the biggest technology companies. China has sought to introduce regulation in areas ranging from anti-trust to data protection.A particular focus of regulators has been non-bank financial players such as Tencent and Alibaba-affiliate Ant Group. These companies offer financial services but traditionally without the strict regulation that banks face. China is looking to change that.Tencent has, so far, managed to escape a major regulatory blow, unlike Alibaba and Meituan which have both been hit with anti-trust fines.",

Founded in 2014, the company has raised $940 million to date, according to Crunchbase data.That was followed in February by Florida-based vertical ag company Kalera announcing plans to go public on the Nasdaq through a merger with a SPAC. The deal is slated to close at the end of April.Now, Future Crops has taken in an undisclosed investment from Tencent\u2014which has found itself in the news for other reasons today. The company had already raised more than $30 million in seed funding from a private equity arm run by the Lerman family of the steel industry.Search less. Close more.

            "description": "By HE WEI in Shanghai | China Daily | Updated: 2022-03-08 09:17Pony Ma Huateng, chairman and CEO of Tencent. [Photo/IC]China should increase technology supply for digital transformation among traditional industries, according to the latest suggestions submitted to the ongoing two sessions.The country should direct more digital research and development efforts to empowering core industries and key sectors, said Pony Ma, a national legislator and the chairman of Tencent Holdings Ltd.Meanwhile, more guidance should be given to traditional enterprises regarding digital transformation, in which technology standardization should be enhanced to lower companies' adoption costs.In his suggestion, Ma said the \"systematic and all-round integration\" of the digital and the real economy stands at a critical stage. Technologies like 5G, artificial intelligence and virtual reality continue to evolve, already enriching traditional industries and making supply chains more resilient.Yet challenges remain in areas such as weak adaptability of technological applications and different industries, weak operability among various digital tools, and a lack of highly coordinated public data applications. Speculation risks might also occur in light of emerging concepts such as the \"metaverse\" and \"non-fungible tokens\".Therefore, he called for more precise and effective digitalization support to be given to \"technologically advanced\" enterprises, and channeling more capital and technology into supporting the real economy.The suggestion also referred to the coordination of security and development, identifying the need to research the governance of new generations of key internet technologies and explore digitalization and low-carbon development.With digitalization fast taking off in China, companies like Amazon Web Services sense growing opportunities.\"This year's Government Work Report further elevates the development of the digital economy and digital trade to a strategic level,\" said Elaine Chang, corporate vice-president and managing director of Amazon Web Services China.\"Cloud computing, as the technical base of the digital economy, will usher in huge development opportunities.\"She said adoption of cloud helps collect and accumulate data, find new insights and business opportunities, and better serve customers through the use of big data and intelligence.It will also lend a helping hand as more companies operate globally, thus facilitating more Chinese brands like Xiaohongshu and Li-Ning to expand overseas and more multinational corporations like Thermo Fisher Scientific that are accelerating investment in China.\"We have a long-term commitment to development in China and are confident in future prospects,\" Chang said. \"We will continue to work closely with local operating partners to accelerate the implementation of the world's leading cloud service products and functions in China, and support the digital transformation and innovation of customers.\"Global consultancy Accenture said its ability to capitalize on China's market opportunity and drive its digital transformation agenda is reflected in the continued growth of its business with over 200,000 employees in the country.\"This is the result of having executed for years a strategy to rotate our business to digital and cloud, hiring and upskilling people across China, and fostering deep relationships with leading local companies and technology partners,\" said Samantha Zhu, chairperson of Accenture China and a member of Accenture's global management committee.According to the latest annual China digital transformation index research by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and Accenture, upgrades and transformation are speeding up and deepening across all sectors, with Chinese businesses eager to make wise and rapid pivots to shape breakthrough solutions and execute at speed and scale.\"With our full-span digital capabilities, we are confident that we can further step up efforts to help our clients navigate changes, transform into thriving organizations and together create a more sustainable future,\" Zhu said.",

The US claimed the Chinese giants have engaged in or facilitated substantial trademark counterfeiting or piracy.The Notorious Markets List highlights online and physical markets that reportedly engage in or facilitate substantial trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy. The 2021 Notorious Markets List also identifies 42 online markets and 35 physical markets that are reported to engage in or facilitate substantial trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy.Although this was the first time that Alibaba\u2019s cross-border e-commerce platforms AliExpress and Tencent\u2019s WeChat were included on the list, they are definitely not the first few China-based companies to be in the Notorious Markets List.

Since February 2011, USTR has published annually the Notorious Markets List separately from the Special 301 Report, to increase public awareness and help market operators and governments prioritize intellectual property enforcement efforts that protect American businesses and their workers.Being included on the list is a blow to the reputation of companies but carries no direct penalties. The USTR office said in a separate report that the US would need to pursue new strategies and update its domestic trade tools to deal with China\u2019s \u201cstate-led, non-market policies and practices.\u201dThis is considering how the US and China have been engaged in trade tensions for years over issues such as tariffs, technology and intellectual property, among others. The US even highlighted that China had failed to make good on some commitments under a so-called \u201cPhase 1\u201d trade agreement signed by the administration of former President Donald Trump.China\u2019s defense after Alibaba, Tencent were added for the first timeThere is no doubt that China would not agree with the US government\u2019s decision with its Notorious Markets List, calling the action \u201cirresponsible\u201d.\u201cWe urge the US to stop politicizing economic and trade issues, and evaluate Chinese companies\u2019 efforts and achievements in intellectual property rights (IPR) in a comprehensive, objective and fair manner,\u201d a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said recently.In the context of China\u2019s effort, in 2021 alone, foreign applicants were granted 110,000 invention patents in China, a year-on-year (YoY) increase of 23%, and 194,000 trademark registrations, with a YoY increase of 5.2%. The US invention patent authorization and trademark registration in China alone increased by 32.1% and 17.3% YoY respectively.Alibaba, after having been added into the list, said it will continue working with government agencies to address concerns about intellectual property protection across its platforms. Tencent on the other hand said it strongly disagreed with the decision and was \u201ccommitted to working collaboratively to resolve this matter.\u201dApart from Alibaba and Tencent, other companies in the list include Singapore\u2019s Shopee, Indonesia\u2019s Bukalapak and Tokopedia as well as India\u2019s Indiamart.",

            "description": "Last week saw Epic Games acquire independent music platform Bandcamp, the latest in the Fortnite maker's line of creator-driven deals.Bandcamp was founded in 2007 to give musicians a place to sell music fairly, at a time where distribution started to pivot to digital. From the off, the site has been designed to give creators full power over how they sell their work, and for how much.It also became a home for indie developers to sell soundtracks; music from Bastion, Terraria, Super Meat Boy and Undertale are but a few examples of games that have had OSTs sold through Bandcamp.While the terms of the Epic deal were not disclosed, Bandcamp co-founder Ethan Diamond was keen to affirm that the services that Bandcamp creators depend on won't be going anywhere -- including Bandcamp Friday, a monthly initiative launched in 2020 where the site takes 0% of any artist's sales for 24 hours. But even with that, many creators were left feeling uncertain about the site's future under such a large umbrella.Kenny YoungKenny Young, sound designer and composer on games including Astro's Playroom and Little Big Planet, questions the announcement's promise to build more opportunities for creators, and whether this deal is more about games than traditional artists.\"It's tempting to think that this purchase must be games-related, but the more I think about it the more unlikely that seems,\" Young tells GamesIndustry.biz.\"It's certainly possible that they'll explore low friction ways of getting Bandcamp music into games -- this would have to be an 'opt-in' for artists as Bandcamp don't own any of the music on their service and therefore don't have the right to licence it without first gaining permission from rights holders.\"But honestly, the use of licensed music in games is a miniscule niche that would only benefit a handful of artists on the platform, so I don't think this alone explains or justifies the acquisition.\"Matt \"2 Mello\" Hopkins is a composer and hip-hop artist heavily influenced by games, best known for his Jet Set Radio inspired album.Hopkins said he would prefer to stay as independent as possible, and the increasing rate of consolidation across the industry has made him nervous.\"It's been a shock to wake up to the news and find that my little corner can also be touched by this ongoing consolidation of everything\" 2 Mello\"I've put a lot of my chips on Bandcamp and I've always said to myself 'things will be OK as long as Bandcamp is there'. For this reason, it's been a shock to wake up to the news and find that my little corner can also be touched by this ongoing consolidation of everything.\"Antoine Bordeleau, head of audiovisual at games marketing agency Purple is Royal is in a unique position; he creates and sells music professionally via Bandcamp but also works with indie titles.Even from both angles, the acquisition came as a bit of a surprise to Bordeleau, as Epic's presence over a company with grassroot support at its core was instantly questionable. It's not just Epic either; an even larger shadow looms over Bandcamp -- Tencent.\"The pay-what-you-want model and the implied independence of using the platform has always been extremely appealing to indie artists as well as music fans wanting to give back to the acts they love, without having a big corporation grabbing most of the money from said transaction,\" Bordeleau says.\"Epic's -- and by extension, Tencent's -- involvement in Bandcamp can be seen as an immediate cause for concern in this department.\"Looking at the bigger consolidation picture, the music industry is becoming increasingly intertwined. Tencent Holdings has a 48% stake in Epic Games, and while that doesn't directly affect Bandcamp, Tencent has slices of other businesses that might tip the scales.Tencent Holdings has a 58% stake in Tencent Music, and both have a 10% stake in Universal Music. Universal has a 3.5% stake in Spotify, while Tencent Music has a 9% stake, and Sony Music has a 2.9% stake. While the percentages are all relatively low, the tethers are still present, and unnecessary ownership of art is the entire problem that Bandcamp was established to avoid.Undertale, scored by Toby Fox, is one indie title to utilise BandcampElla Hagi, senior campaign manager at creative studio Yrs Truly, emphasises Bandcamp's authenticity, particularly its cruciality in uplifting black artists over the last few years. That said, she's remaining open-minded for now, and curious to see what Epic can bring to the table.\"There is authenticity to Bandcamp that no other underground music venture of this scale can claim. Epic, as we know, is partial to indie endeavours,\" Hagi says. \"Who's to say the Epic Store will remain limited to games? Will they introduce a subscription model to Bandcamp?\"\"We know of the influence games have had on music, but the influence and credibility musicians have is definitely not at its peak when it comes to promoting games, so this may open new avenues in this respect.\"Epic's -- and by extension, Tencent's -- involvement in Bandcamp can be seen as an immediate cause for concern in this department\" Antoine Bordeleau\"I'm definitely exercising caution here but I do think gone are the days when we need to just dismiss people or companies as sellouts, so I'm keen to see what's going to happen -- I just hope whatever is to come allows Bandcamp to continue putting artists first.\"Bordeleau also noted that the deal between the two could close the gap between the games and music industries.\"If Bandcamp and Epic could find a way to bridge the gap between labels, artists and game devs, there could be a whole new way of selling your music and reaching new audiences somewhere in there,\" he says.Young also mused on the positives, pushing aside the games angle for a moment to look at how Bandcamp could be improved, and how Epic could help. Last year, the company acquired artist platform ArtStation and 3D marketplace Sketchfab, as part of its vision to build out a marketplace ecosystem for all types of creative disciplines.\"Streaming is how most people consume music these days, and Bandcamp is not a streaming service.\" Young explains. \"Technically it exists, but it's a poor experience.\"More ways for people to find and listen to independent music that fairly compensates artists can only be a good thing\" Kenny Young\"That's partly a business decision which puts all the emphasis on purchases, downloads and merch. But the 2000s-era design of the service also suggests that the company doesn't have the technical smarts to enter the streaming market even if they wanted to. If that's the case, teaming up with Epic perhaps makes a bit more sense.\"I find myself romanticising that Epic are going to take on Apple Music, but an artist-friendly streaming service isn't attractive to the major labels so I'm not sure there's going to be much in the way of competition for big names there. So, it really does look like an altruistic purchase to me -- more ways for people to find and listen to independent music that fairly compensates artists can only be a good thing.\"Epic and Apple have been at odds with each other for the last couple of years, primarily in the form of a lengthy lawsuit that sparked after Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store after Epic tried to circumnavigate the platform's 30% platform fee. Bordeleau notes that Epic has garnered both good and bad will from consumers and developers in the wake of that battle, but ultimately Epic does take less money than its competitors.\"The Epic Games Store's cut on transactions is less than half of what Google and Apple siphon out on their respective app stores; this could be a glimmer of hope that if Epic wants to change how music is consumed and bought on Bandcamp, it might be going for a better redistribution of wealth model for artists than what the norm is with streaming services,\" he says.Epic has been combining music and games with its series of interactive concerts inside FortniteHopkins considers Bandcamp his main source of income, and believes the platform is the best option for receiving continued revenue from a project. He also notes that streaming alone. isn't a reliable or sustainable source of income for a lot of musicians.\"Bandcamp has been the best option for receiving an equitable income from making music,\" he says. \"Speaking as a composer for independent games, I believe Bandcamp is also the best option for receiving continued income from soundtrack work by negotiating with your dev team to sell your soundtracks through the site and keep those profits.\"With that in mind, he's a little more reserved on how Epic might alter Bandcamp's offering, even if it doesn't exactly intend to.\"While I do work in games, I don't have any experience working with Epic Games, so my involvement in games makes this acquisition more bizarre and surreal than anything else,\" he adds. \"I've seen how this pursuit of endless growth can change a service that was perfectly fine on its own, and I've always hoped that temptation wasn't there at all for Bandcamp. It's true that we don't know how this one will go, but I don't think it's too unreasonable for artists to already have their defences up about this development.\"While Epic's revenue slicing is positive, the hum of buzzwords such as NFTs and metaverse linger, and Bordeleau is concerned that perhaps Bandcamp's pursuit of a deal hastened from the two-year financial lull that the music industry faced in the wake of the pandemic.And the business has already established its position on blockchain technology. While Valve affirmed that NFTs would not be permitted on Steam, Epic was quick to take the opposite stance, saying that crypto-enabled games and services would be welcome on the Epic Game Store providing they align with platform guidelines.While there's no reason to suspect that those things will encroach on Bandcamp moving forward, the probability is never zero.\"Take it from someone who remembers MySpace, you really never know when your favourite platform's gonna just shut down, or mutate into something that isn't aligned with your (or your favourite artists') values,\" Bordeleau says.",

            "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd. is stepping up the use of renewable energy with a goal of zeroing out emissions by 2030, acknowledging the damage wrought by its data centers while heeding Beijing\u2019s call to protect the environment.The Chinese social media and gaming giant plans to use all but renewable energy by the same timeframe and has already purchased 500 million kilowatt hours of wind and solar energy this year -- roughly equivalent to the electricity consumption of 40,000 American homes for a year -- to power some of its data centers, it said in a report unveiled Thursday.Related: Greenpeace Calls Out Alibaba, Tencent in First China \"Clean Cloud\" RankingTencent is one of the world\u2019s largest operators of data centers, which require massive amounts of energy and cooling. The internet industry worldwide has drawn fire from environmentalists and China\u2019s government, which is ordering its wealthiest corporations to curb excesses after a decade of heady expansion.It\u2019s the latest among China\u2019s big tech firms to unveil their zero-emission blueprints, in the wake of Xi Jinping\u2019s call to make China carbon neutral by 2060. It\u2019s also announced plans to give back to society as Xi\u2019s administration pursues a campaign to get affluent private enterprises to share the wealth. Last year, the WeChat operator pledged to set aside $15 billion for social responsibility programs to tackle issues from renewable energy to scientific education and health care.Tencent will rely mostly on cutting direct emissions and using green power to zero out emissions in its own operations and supply chain, only buying carbon offsets as a last resort, Xu Hao, the company\u2019s green chief, said in an interview. Xu, a vice president for Tencent\u2019s \u201csustainable social value\u201d program, didn\u2019t elaborate on the breakdown of each approach, but says green power will contribute the most.In 2021, the baseline year for Tencent\u2019s net zero emission plan, the firm recorded a total carbon emission of 5.1 million tons, with roughly 54% of that stemming from infrastructure construction and the purchase of computer servers. The rest originates mostly from electricity, heating and cooling, it said in the report. By comparison, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has said its supply-chain emissions were about 5.3 million tons in 2020.In the next three to five years, Tencent will improve the energy efficiency of its data centers by installing distributed photovoltaic power generation devices while increasing investment in renewable energy projects, Xu said.Tencent\u2019s direct emissions have been on the rise as the company expanded over the past few years. Xu said while the company\u2019s emissions may have experienced a small increase in the beginning, it will eventually achieve its 2030 target due to decarbonization efforts.\u201cCutting direct emissions is our top priority, followed by using green power. And buying offset comes last,\u201d he said.Tencent isn\u2019t alone among Chinese tech firms in planning out a cleaner future. Alibaba has said it plans to zero out emissions for its own operation by 2030. Search leader Baidu Inc. has a similar goal for 2030 through initiatives including building green data centers, smart offices and intelligent transportation.Under what\u2019s known as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Standard, emissions are classed as Scope 1, 2 or 3, with the last category covering emissions that come from the entire value chain. Tencent\u2019s Thursday report didn\u2019t include emissions generated by product use from its consumers under Scope 3, which is covered by hardware giants like Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Apple Inc.A company spokesperon said that Tencent performed comprehensive accounting exercise of all 15 categories of Scope 3 emissions, and included 8 categories that are material to Tencent, including data-center equipment and employee commuting.",

            "description": "Late last month, buried toward the bottom of a blog post about its current metaverse push, Improbable CEO Herman Narula announced the SpatialOS company's withdrawal from first-party game development.\"We are in advanced discussions with potential partners for the games being developed within the Edmonton and Midwinter studios and it is our belief that they will reach their full potential supported by publishers with leading track records of bringing games to market,\" Narula said.The fate of Midwinter is still to be determined, but Improbable today announced that it has sold its majority stake in the Edmonton-based Inflexion Games to Tencent.Inflexion is currently working on its first game, NightingaleTerms of the deal were not disclosed, but Inflexion CEO Aaryn Flynn tells GamesIndustry.biz the shift had been in the works since last summer, when Improbable \"saw a future for itself in a different direction,\" but worked with Inflexion to divest itself of the studio in a way that would be amenable to all involved.While Inflexion wasn't in a position to dictate terms here, Flynn says Narula and Improbable were supportive in the process and took the studio's desires into consideration. Flynn says chief among those was operational independence \"to build the game we want to build, and the trust that comes along with that.\"\"In my experience, good game developers are always willing to have conversations and accept feedback, but there are limits and expectations on that that had to be respected\" Aaryn Flynn\"In my experience, good game developers are always willing to have conversations and accept feedback, but there are limits and expectations on that that had to be respected. And we heard that from Tencent,\" Flynn says.He adds that Tencent's track record among the Western studios it has invested in is excellent, and to date the company has been \"very respectful\" of Inflexion's design and world-building decisions.\"But at the same time, we recognized in them not just the biggest game development company in the world, but a company that had vast experience in creating compelling live services and engaging player communities, and understanding exactly the culture that's necessary to go and build that,\" Flynn says. \"And since that was a big part of our business plan with Nightingale, we got excited by that complementary expertise.\"Nightingale is Inflexion's debut title, a survival crafting game set for Early Access launch later this year. It has already undergone a significant change as a result of this deal, as it will no longer use SpatialOS. Instead, Flynn says it will be \"a more intimate, single-player or small group player experience\" that doesn't need the scale that cloud computing outfits like Improbable or Google Stadia had been pushing.\"We made that decision last summer in conjunction with some other things we want to do with the game,\" Flynn says. \"That was largely driven from a game design standpoint and where we want to take the game. More and more, we were investing in elements of our survival crafting experience and we made the decision that to ensure we could ship this game and not find ourselves in the very long development cycle that many MMOs do, we would walk away from those things.\"Flynn still believes there's a lot of potential in cloud computing, but it's a chicken-and-egg problem whether the technology or the vision for a player experience that makes effective use of it will come first.\"The challenge in our industry is that as you look across games that are getting built, there's still so much potential for innovation with what we have,\" Flynn says. \"Rarely do we see a new technology that changes everything and makes you say, 'I can't go back now.' Some people call it 'the color TV moment.' There's still a lot of low-hanging fruit, for lack of a better term, in simple and clever and meaningful design decisions.\"He points to battle royale games as one such innovation over the team-based capture the flag modes that previously dominated the industry as one example of \"low-hanging fruit\" innovation.\"There's a ton of potential for [cloud computing] technology, but until it's married to a fantastic design and something people say, 'Well I couldn't imagine playing a game without this design supported by the technology anymore,' it's probably not going to realize its full potential,\" Flynn says.Beyond the change in ownership impacting the game, the sale to Tencent also has the potential to impact the studio in a larger way. It's something Flynn understands well, given his 17-year run at BioWare as that studio went from an independent developer to a wholly owned division of Electronic Arts.Flynn says his experience at BioWare definitely informed his preferences in the search for a new parent company like Tencent, in particular the need for operational independence.\"When that shared understanding belongs between individuals rather than in the organization itself, that's where you start to see change sweep in...\" Aaryn Flynn\"It was so important that we understood exactly how we were going to go and work together,\" Flynn says. \"Everybody's got great perspectives, great ideas, and great thoughts in the honeymoon period of coming together and doing this, but it's really about the specific commitments and the very specific expectations of each other.\"Looking back at BioWare, Flynn says there was a lot of spiritual support and shared vision between EA and the studio, at least in the early days of the union.\"I think where things started to get more difficult was when leadership changes happened, when people left,\" Flynn says. \"When that shared understanding belongs between individuals rather than in the organization itself, that's where you start to see change sweep in, and the change goes -- in this case -- the way of the parent company.\"When [BioWare co-founders] Ray [Muzyka] and Greg [Zeschuk] retired, when [EA CEO] John Riccitiello left, when the folks who had been the architects of that relationship left, we had to build new relationships and hopefully people share the same expectations. But that's not what happened in that case, and it's very typical in these situations.\"The honeymoon period with Tencent is going well, and while there are few guarantees as to what the future will hold, for now Flynn seems quite happy to close the book on the uncertainty and stress of the last nine months or so the transition from Improbable has been in the works.\"I'd say our team has dealt with their share of change and uncertainty to this point, but we still made progress on our game and I'm really keen to support them with some clarity and consistency going forward in this exciting new reality for us.\"",

It's now the world's 11th most valuable company with a $565 billion valuation.Founded in 1998, Tencent was initially focused on its free desktop instant messaging service, but has since grown to offer mobile instant messaging, payments, video, gaming, and advertising services. It introduced its WeChat platform in 2011, and that now has 1.26 billion users, according to the company's third-quarter earnings results.AdvertisementAfter listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in June 2004, Tencent entered the top ten for the first time in April 2017 by kicking Wells Fargo off the chart. Its market value was $279 billion then.Tencent's valuation neared $1 trillion in early 2021. But after Beijing cracked down on homegrown tech giants last year, the company's share price slid. It most recently exited the top 10 list of most valuable companies globally in December, together with Alibaba, leaving no Chinese representation on that list, Nikkei reported.Tencent's co-founder Pony Ma's wealth has also ebbed and flowed with the company's fortunes.

Virtual reality is a key part of the concept of the metaverse. Xing Yun | Costfoto | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesImagine this: the metaverse with Chinese characteristics. That's how the virtual world that everyone's talking about will likely look in the world's second-largest economy. China's technology giants are beginning to invest in the metaverse \u2014 the latest buzzword in internet technology. It's a term with no concrete definition, but largely taken to mean virtual worlds that people will be playing and living in. Censorship will likely be rife and regulation tight as Beijing continues to keep a close check on the practices of its domestic technology firms. U.S. firms like Facebook parent Meta are going all-in on the metaverse concept, while Microsoft has positioned its proposed acquisition of gaming company Activision as a play on this theme. Chinese firms are taking a more cautious approach. So what are they up to and how will regulation play out?What are the apps?In China, the total addressable market for the metaverse could be 52 trillion yuan, or around $8 trillion, Morgan Stanley said in a note published last month. Companies like Tencent , NetEase , TikTok owner ByteDance and Alibaba could be the front-runners in this space among China's internet companies.Metaverse is the future of social network. All China's tech giants have to embrace it to find new ways to engage the youngest generation of internet users... Winston Ma managing partner, CloudTree VenturesThat comes down to the type of applications that could be part of the metaverse. Analysts say that virtual reality, gaming and social media could be some of the early applications. This may include things like buying virtual items in games or creating digital avatars of yourself to participate in meetings. \"Metaverse is the future of social network. All China's tech giants have to embrace it to find new ways to engage the youngest generation of internet users, which is critical at the time when their business models on smartphones and mobile internet are matured,\" Winston Ma, managing partner at CloudTree Ventures, told CNBC.China's tech giants in the metaverseIn an earnings call in November, Tencent CEO Pony Ma said the metaverse will be an opportunity to add growth to existing industries such as gaming. Tencent is the world's largest gaming company with a strong portfolio of PC and mobile games. Tencent also owns WeChat, a messaging service with over a billion users that has social media aspects. Ma said the company has \"a lot of the technology and know-how building blocks\" to explore and develop the metaverse. Meanwhile, ByteDance has made an aggressive expansion into gaming over the last year. In August, the company acquired virtual reality headset maker Pico. ByteDance also owns TikTok, the short-form video app, and its Chinese equivalent Douyin. The Beijing-headquartered firm has laid foundations in VR, social media and gaming.watch nowAlibaba this year said it plans to launch augmented reality glasses for virtual meetings. Augmented reality refers to virtual images overlaid on the real world. Again, this could be a play on the metaverse. The e-commerce giant launched a \"virtual influencer\" named Dong Dong for the Winter Olympics in Beijing. The digital avatar can be found on Alibaba's Taobao shopping app and provides facts about the Olympics and also promotes items related to the Games. NetEase , another one of China's gaming giants, has set up a base in the southern province of Hainan focused on the development of metaverse applications, local media reported last year. Search giant Baidu launched a metaverse app last year called XiRang, a sort of virtual world that can hold up to 100,000 people at once. Baidu executives, however, downplayed expectations of the app at its launch and said many aspects were not yet up to par. Ma Jie, a vice president at Baidu, said it could be another six years until a full launch.Still, there are signs that China's biggest technology names are beginning to experiment and lay the groundwork for future applications. \"Similar to the pitch we've seen from Meta, the metaverse concept may at first involved VR/AR-supported games and social interactive environments,\" Charles Mok, the founder of Tech For Good Asia, told CNBC. \"These will obviously be the areas that China big tech players will follow first, with features that are advanced in China \u2014 such as payment, and WeChat-like integrated online services \u2014 that can be extended and built into the metaverse.\"China's regulated metaverseThe metaverse push by Chinese tech firms comes after an intense year of regulatory scrutiny on the country's tech sector. New anti-monopoly laws for internet platforms were proposed, while a landmark personal data protection law has been passed. Beijing has also cut the amount of time children under 18 years of age are allowed to play online games. Analysts said these existing pieces of legislation will likely be used to regulate metaverse applications as well, even as new ones are developed. \"The sheer diversity of metaverse applications means developing a 'one-fits-all' set of policies will not be feasible for Beijing,\" Hanyu Liu, China market analyst at Daxue Consulting, told CNBC. \"Each specific application would receive its own unique set of regulations that builds upon existing legislature.\"[China] knows just when and where it needs to stay its hand; close enough so that it can keep a careful watch, but not to the point where it would cause irreversible harm to the industry. Hanyu Liu China market analyst, Daxue ConsultingChina also continues to censor content on its tightly controlled internet. \"We should also expect to see strict censorship, meaning there will most likely be an isolated, Chinese metaverse that is separate from the international,\" Liu said. There are more specific pieces of regulation that analysts said could be used to manage the metaverse. In January, authorities passed a set of regulations that governs how internet firms can use recommendation algorithms. That was followed by draft rules regarding so-called \"deep synthesis\" technology. This relates to software that could be used to generate or edit voices, video or images or virtual settings. The two rules overlap. \"This overlap with the recent algorithm rule as specifically required by the new rule would have important impact on Metaverse companies in China,\" Ma said.Even Chinese cities and regions are looking at opportunities for the metaverse. Last year, the major city of Shanghai mentioned the metaverse in its five-year development plan for the information technology industry. \"China is extremely smart when it comes to this. It knows just when and where it needs to stay its hand; close enough so that it can keep a careful watch, but not to the point where it would cause irreversible harm to the industry,\" Liu said.What about crypto?Some metaverse applications may rely on cryptocurrencies. For example, if you are buying some sort of virtual land or item, you could pay with a digital currency. This is likely to be problematic in China, where the government has looked to wipe out trading and the so-called mining of cryptocurrencies.",

Their perfect partnership frays when Marla (Carter), a fellow support group crasher, attracts Tyler\u2019s attention.In the original, The Narrator (Norton), kills off his imaginary alter ego Tyler, and then watches multiple buildings explode, suggesting his character\u2019s plan to bring down modern civilisation is afoot.(Fight Club/Trailer)However, in the Chinese version of the hit film, The Narrator killed Tyler, and the exploding scene was replaced with a black screen with the caption: \u201cThe police rapidly figured out the whole plan and arrested all criminals, successfully preventing the bomb from exploding.\u201dIt also said that Tyler was sent to a \u201clunatic system\u201d for treatment.The change immediately caused outrage among fans, with many complaining that \u201ccompanies shouldn\u2019t completely change the intent and purpose of films just to sell out in Chinese markets.\u201dAnother person wrote: \u201cThe first rule of Fight Club in China? Don\u2019t mention the original ending. The second rule of Fight Club in China? Change it so the police win.\u201d",

After reports came out that streaming service Tencent Video had edited the famed ending featuring the Narrator (Edward Norton) killing his split personality Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and blowing up a city skyline with love interest Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), Tencent Video has since released the original ending online.Per The Hollywood Reporter, Tencent has restored 11 out of the 12 minutes it originally cut from the film\u2019s climax. The missing minute includes a nude sex scene between Pitt and Bonham Carter\u2019s characters; however, the iconic explosion sequence remains in full.Tencent originally cut the finale, with the film fading to black and a caption added stating that in the end, the police thwarted Tyler\u2019s destructive plan.\u201cThrough the clue provided by Tyler, the police rapidly figured out the whole plan and arrested all criminals, successfully preventing the bomb from exploding,\u201d the title card read. \u201cAfter the trial, Tyler was sent to lunatic asylum receiving psychological treatment.

            "description": "Playable Futures is a collection of insights, interviews and articles from global games leaders sharing their visions of where the industry will go next. This article series has been brought to you by GamesIndustry.biz, Ukie, Sumo Group and Diva. It wasn't long ago that video gaming meant playing Pong in an arcade or firing up an eight-bit home console to shoot blocky space invaders. Today, we play games with 3D graphics at 4K resolution on a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X - if you can find one - or on your state-of-the-art smartphone. And increasingly, as hardware specs improve and developers build new content, by slipping on a VR headset and entering a 360-degree virtual world. Games are created for entertainment, whether they use cards, a board, a smartphone, PC, console, or headset. But a funny thing has happened since the world of gaming moved from analogue to digital, from the real world to virtual ones: never before have so many around the globe been connected with each other. To give you a sense of size and scope, here's but one example: since Tencent Games launched PUBG MOBILE in 2018, players have downloaded the game over 1 billion times. That's roughly one out of every 7.7 people on the planet downloading and playing a single video game with each other on their mobile phones. Steven Ma, Tencent And daily, some 50 million players from dozens of countries, including the UK, US, Brazil and more team up in PUBG MOBILE to accomplish their mission. So, it occurs to me, as the head of Tencent Games - the world's largest games platform company by many measures - that it's time for game developers to accomplish ours.Impact Beyond Revenue We could savour the popularity of our many great games and the revenue they bring in. But that would squander a much-bigger opportunity to make the world we live in better. Startup founders and executives often wave the wand about greater purpose and altruism, but we all know the real magic is in action and results. The games sector has reached an inflection point. For a company like Tencent, we believe that when you have such a large, engaged global audience, it comes with many responsibilities. While we will continue to lead the way with advances in technology and player experience, we must apply them to the needs of broader society. And keeping the global community in mind is very much in line with Tencent's overall mission statement: \"value for users, tech for good.\" \"We think it's on us and other creators of groundbreaking technology to tackle real-world issues\" I love music and culture. I was recently reminded of how games can play a role in promoting and preserving both when my country's most-popular game -- Honor of Kings -- produced a new in-game skin inspired by traditional Chinese Yue Opera. Attendance at live performances has, sadly, dwindled in recent years. Imagine my surprise, though, when I found some 80 million players have used the skin, exposing them to the genre and its characters and generating renewed interest in what previously looked to be a dying art form. To extend this further, we think it's on us and other creators of new and groundbreaking technology to tackle real-world issues.A Powerful Medium For example, using video games and technology to help deliver better results in education. Starting in 2018, Tencent got serious about Serious Games, publishing ones that taught users typing and geometry at their own pace - and in a fun and engaging way. A year later, we demonstrated our technological prowess, both with a game that enabled the visually impaired to play, and another that allowed the visually unimpaired to experience the world without full eyesight. Then, last year, I was excited to hear about the 'MindPod,' a gaming experience aimed at helping repair the brains of stroke victims from MindMaze Healthcare. Motion-sensitive cameras track the arm movements of stroke patients as they guide an onscreen dolphin over a floor-to-ceiling screen to catch fish. The actions supposedly gave a \"jolt\" to the players' brains, enabling them to recover some of their mobility. And it's more than just a good idea. I saw the game is being put to practical use in the UK's Royal Buckinghamshire Hospital. Our responsibility as a leading game platform also means ensuring a healthy environment for all, with a special focus on our younger players. As such, Tencent is involved in several programs, including the #WePROTECT Global Alliance, which aims to provide a safer and more secure internet for children and adolescents. Honor of Kings has helped boost traditional Chinese Yue Opera Though I marvel at how technology - the hardware, software, connectivity, coding, and more - has fundamentally changed the way we play and engage with each other, we should bear in mind gaming is not all about technology.",

            "description": "A 25-year-old employee at Chinese video platform Bilibili suddenly died during the Lunar New Year holiday last week, with the cause of death suspected to be overwork. The incident put Bilibili in the spotlight, sparking an online debate about the culture of overwork in China\u2019s internet industry.A Weibo influencer known as Wang Luobei posted about the incident on Monday after receiving a direct message saying a content moderator at Bilibili\u2019s Wuhan subsidiary died at work during the holiday period. Multiple Weibo users, who asked to remain anonymous, have since sent direct messages to Wang to confirm the death.In response, Bilibili issued an internal memo on Monday, stating that the employee was feeling unwell on the afternoon of February 4 and claimed he did not die due to excessive work. According to the company, the deceased employee was on a nine-hour shift that day from 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., and did not work overtime over the week before his death.However, a Weibo user who claimed to be the employee\u2019s cousin refuted Bilibili\u2019s response, suggesting that a highly intensive workload led to his death. \u201cHe didn\u2019t come home during the Lunar New Year holiday and decided to stay in Wuhan for work,\u201d she said.The cousin posted a screenshot of the employee\u2019s account on WeCom, an enterprise collaboration app, which showed a summary of his work activities for 2021. This included records of the employee working until \u201clate at night\u201d for 321 days last year, including one instance where he left work at 4:00 a.m. in November.Bilibili said it is cooperating with the police for their investigation into the employee\u2019s death.According to job openings for content moderator positions at Bilibili, staff members must \u201caccept night shifts, and have a strong ability to work under pressure.\u201d One of the posts, which is still online for active recruitment, specifically states that the job involves 12-hour overnight shifts.The \u201c996\u201d work schedule\u2014being on shift from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., at least six days a week\u2014is commonplace in China\u2019s major tech companies. Even though the government has said the practice is illegal, overtime culture is still prevalent.Last month, internal chat records showing an entry-level Tencent employee speaking out against intensive workloads went viral in China, renewing discussion surrounding overwork practices at tech companies. A Tencent executive said he felt ashamed because of his employees\u2019 overwork, and said he hoped to see more internet companies confront the issue.",

The main payment product is the option to pay in two, three or four installments.But the company also offers different plans. For instance, Alma offers 10-month or 12-month plans. Those options are particularly popular with some specific purchases, such as consumer electronics devices or furniture.Finally, Alma has a payment option that lets you buy something and pay 15 or 30 days later. This could be particularly useful for clothing items and other goods that you think you might like, but you might end up returning.Overall, Alma processes more than \u20ac1 billion annually with its current run rate. It doesn\u2019t charge late payment fees, as the company thinks it isn\u2019t aligned with consumers\u2019 interests. Some companies, such as PayPal, have dropped late fees on BNPL installments. Others generate some revenue from those late interests.Instead, Alma charges payment processing fees. Some merchants choose to pay those fees directly, hoping that it\u2019ll increase sales. Other merchants share those fees with the end customers. It\u2019s up to the merchant.Alma is following in Klarna\u2019s footsteps and has launched a mobile app for consumers. For now, the app only lets you manage your payments. At some point during the first half of 2022, the company will let you generate virtual cards to pay in multiple installments everywhere.In addition to online payments, consumers can pay with Alma in retail stores. The payment option can be integrated in the payment terminals, or merchants can generate a payment link and share it with customers. In-store payments represent 30% of payment volume.The startup works with Alain Afflelou, Etam, Galeries Lafayette, Printemps and Ankorstore. The company recently expanded to other markets. It is now available in Spain, Italy, Germany and Belgium. And Alma now plans to expand to the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Portugal, Ireland and Austria. In other words, Alma has refined its product \u2014 it\u2019s now time to expand more widely.",

            "description": "Tech conglomerate Tencent caused a stir last year with the announcement that it would comply with China\u2019s directive to incorporate facial recognition technology into its games in the country. The move was in line with China\u2019s strict gaming regulation policies, which impose limits on how much time minors can spend playing video games\u2014an effort to curb addictive behavior, since gaming is labeled by the state as \u201cspiritual opium.\u201dThe state\u2019s use of biometric data to police its population is, of course, invasive, and especially undermines the privacy of underage users\u2014but Tencent is not the only video game company to track its players, nor is this recent case an altogether new phenomenon. All over the world, video games, one of the most widely adopted digital media forms, are installing networks of surveillance and control.In basic terms, video games are systems that translate physical inputs\u2014such as hand movement or gesture\u2014into various electric or electronic machine-readable outputs. The user, by acting in ways that comply with the rules of the game and the specifications of the hardware, is parsed as data by the video game. Writing almost a decade ago, the sociologists Jennifer R. Whitson and Bart Simon argued that games are increasingly understood as systems that easily allow the reduction of human action into knowable and predictable formats.Video games, then, are a natural medium for tracking, and researchers have long argued that large data sets about players\u2019 in-game activities are a rich resource in understanding player psychology and cognition. In one study from 2012, Nick Yee, Nicolas Ducheneaut, and Les Nelson scraped player activity data logged on the World of Warcraft Armory website\u2014essentially a database that records all the things a player\u2019s character has done in the game (how many of a certain monster I\u2019ve killed, how many times I\u2019ve died, how many fish I\u2019ve caught, and so on).SUBSCRIBE Subscribe to WIRED and stay smart with more of your favorite Ideas writers.The researchers used this data to infer personality characteristics (in combination with data yielded through a survey). The paper suggests, for example, that there is a correlation between the survey respondents classified as more conscientious in their game-playing approach and the tendency to spend more time doing repetitive and dull in-game tasks, such as fishing. Conversely, those whose characters more often fell to death from high places were less conscientious, according to their survey responses.Correlation between personality and quantitative gameplay data is certainly not unproblematic. The relationship between personality and identity and video game activity is complex and idiosyncratic; for instance, research suggests that gamer identity intersects with gender, racial, and sexual identity. Additionally, there has been general pushback against claims of Big Data\u2019s production of new knowledge rooted in correlation. Despite this, games companies increasingly realize the value of big data sets to gain insight into what a player likes, how they play, what they play, what they\u2019ll likely spend money on (in freemium games), how and when to offer the right content, and how to solicit the right kinds of player feelings.While there are no numbers on how many video game companies are surveilling their players in-game (although, as a recent article suggests, large publishers and developers like Epic, EA, and Activision explicitly state they capture user data in their license agreements), a new industry of firms selling middleware \u201cdata analytics\u201d tools, often used by game developers, has sprung up. These data analytics tools promise to make users more amenable to continued consumption through the use of data analysis at scale. Such analytics, once available only to the largest video game studios\u2014which could hire data scientists to capture, clean, and analyze the data, and software engineers to develop in-house analytics tools\u2014are now commonplace across the entire industry, pitched as \u201caccessible\u201d tools that provide a competitive edge in a crowded marketplace by companies like Unity, GameAnalytics, or Amazon Web Services. (Although, as a recent study shows, the extent to which these tools are truly \u201caccessible\u201d is questionable, requiring technical expertise and time to implement.) As demand for data-driven insight has grown, so have the range of different services\u2014dozens of tools in the past several years alone, providing game developers with different forms of insight. One tool\u2014essentially Uber for playtesting\u2014allows companies to outsource quality assurance testing, and provides data-driven insight into the results. Another supposedly uses AI to understand player value and maximize retention (and spending, with a focus on high-spenders).",

I will provide examples on the value of working with celebrities and key opinion leaders (KOL) and how such activations are integrated into a 360-degree marketing strategy.Is there any key background information or context people should be aware of coming into your talk?PUBGM is almost in its 4th year and continues to grow its global player base and attract an ever-increasing audience for its esports element - this is especially true in Turkey, where it is the most watched mobile game.What were the key localisation challenges for PUBGM?The biggest challenge is to really understand the local culture. As you know, PUBGM is published in more than 200 markets globally, and we are the top game in many countries. The key for that success is our good localisation, not only in Turkey, but also in other markets. It is not always easy to understand a different culture or language such as Turkey as we have thousands of years of heritage from both Asia and Europe, but we managed to overcome that and put a good system in place for localisation.Esports are enormously popular in Turkey; according to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, there are around 15,000 grassroots esports teams. What unique support is Turkey providing to have facilitated this growth?We have established an esports system globally and locally - amateur, semi-pro to pro - which provides a platform for emerging Turkish esports talents to play and grow.Mobile esports remains nascent in territories like the US and UK. But regions like China and, of course, Turkey have been much quicker in engaging with it. What is the core appeal of mobile esports in the country?Turkey is a country with a very young population compared to most other western European countries. As a result, the engagement to gaming overall is higher, thereby resulting in a more active user base for core games. Since most of the esports teams are owned by influencers and KOLs who themselves are targeting young audiences, we are seeing more interest in mobile esports compared to western Europe.Finally, you have one sentence to persuade someone why they should come to your talk. What would it be?If you want to learn how to create a gaming culture with the help of localisation and local marketing, this is the one talk you shouldn\u2019t miss.You can read all Road to Connects interviews and articles at this link.",

            "description": "Chinese authorities have embarked on a campaign to clean up the internet ahead of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games, and during the current weeklong Spring Festival\u2014a celebration of the Chinese New Year, the country\u2019s biggest holiday.The first potential app casualty of China\u2019s pre-Olympics and Spring Festival internet purge? Gay dating service Grindr.Early last week, China\u2019s cyberspace watchdog announced the start of new efforts to regulate internet content\u2014to root out everything from fraud and cyber threats to pornography, online rumors, and celebrity and money worship\u2014in order to \u201crectify the chaos of bad behavior on the internet\u2026and create a healthy and peaceful network\u2026for netizens, especially minors.\u201dThen last Thursday, dating service Grindr disappeared from several app stores in China, including Apple\u2019s, and domestic platforms like Tencent and Huawei. Grindr\u2019s operator cited challenges in staying compliant with China\u2019s Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) enacted in November, according to Bloomberg\u2014a set of stringent new rules for companies storing Chinese personal data.Grindr\u2019s decision to pull the app from China\u2019s app stores was voluntary and \u201cmade last year, and has been in process for the last few months\u2026 [due to the] changing regulatory environment,\u201d similar to LinkedIn\u2019s decision to exit the Chinese market, a company spokesperson told Fortune. Microsoft shut down LinkedIn in China last October, noting that operating a localized Chinese version on LinkedIn means \u201cadherence to [government] requirements on Internet platforms.\u201d Grindr has an office in Taiwan. The company will \u201cregularly reevaluate\u201d its decision and strategy on China \u201cas the regulatory environment evolves,\u201d the spokesperson said.China has long banned Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and WhatsApp, among other services. China\u2019s homegrown social platforms like blogging platform Weibo and Tencent\u2019s WeChat\u2014the country\u2019s most popular messaging and social media app with over 1 billion monthly users\u2014are subject to surveillance and censorship.Chinese authorities\u2019 oversight of people\u2019s behavior, both online and offline, has increased in the lead-up to the Olympics, which start Feb. 4. During important events like the Olympics, when the world is paying close attention to China, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is extra vigilant in monitoring what social content is circulating and what the media is saying. Beijing \u201cinvariably [tries] to curb free expression even further than usual\u201d during such events, says Dexter Roberts, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Asia Security Initiative and author of The Myth of Chinese Capitalism.Ahead of the Winter Games, authorities have already locked up potential activists and shut down the social media accounts of well-known critics\u2014in addition to surveilling athletes and other Olympic participants, says Karman Lucero, a fellow at Yale University\u2019s Paul Tsai China Center focused on Chinese technology law and policy. The state-run mobile app that participating athletes in Beijing will be required to download\u2014which serves as a health monitoring tool to upload vaccination records and log COVID-19 symptoms\u2014has also been criticized over security, privacy, and censorship concerns.Yet Grindr\u2019s disappearance in China may be also linked to Beijing\u2019s ongoing push to encourage \u201ctraditional\u201d family values and discourage \u201ceffeminate\u201d and \u201csissy\u201d men as the country grapples with a demographic crisis. China\u2019s population growth rate fell to a six-decade low in 2021. Same-sex marriage remains illegal in China, and \u201cgay-themed content and products\u201d on social media have been regularly targeted for censorship, thereby putting Grindr in Beijing\u2019s crosshairs, says Roberts. \u201cAnything that doesn\u2019t\u2026fall within traditional gender roles is increasingly frowned upon,\u201d he says.At best, LGBT groups are seen as \u201cinconvenient, if not outright dangerous\u201d to society and stability in China, given they don\u2019t conform to Party ideology and goals, says Lucero. Last July, Tencent-operated WeChat deleted dozens of university student\u2013run LGBT accounts, igniting concerns that authorities were ramping up its censorship of gay content online. In 2020, Shanghai Pride shut down after 12 years owing to increasing pressure from authorities.China\u2019s pre-Olympics campaign to step up policing of the internet and citizen behavior is part of a broader censorship push that will likely endure even after the Games end, experts say.In the past five years, China\u2019s internet freedoms have regressed, even though the country seemed to be on an opposite trajectory throughout the early 2010s, says Zak Dychtwald, founder and CEO of Beijing-based consultancy Young China Group and author of Young China: How the Restless Generation Will Change Their Country and the World. As a result, netizens, especially young people, are more cautious now in what they post online. \u201cWe hear more and more of young people\u2019s self-censorship [online], and relating how their parents immediately [tell] them to [delete] a post if it toes the line. [These] small behavior changes can shift\u2026national conversation and perception,\u201d he says.The government\u2019s crackdown on internet content, apps, and free speech could grow much larger, Lucero says, with anything that\u2019s perceived as too popular, too foreign, or if the party deems it threatening, to likely face growing censorship.Update, Feb. 3, 2022: This story was updated from the original with a comment from Grindr.",

            "description": "Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.Exchange traded fund investors wanting to invest in the China growth story, but worried about regulatory winds buffeting the country\u2019s internet giants, may take succour from the latest CSI 300 rebalancing.December\u2019s rebalancing of the CSI 300, China\u2019s key benchmark of onshore-listed companies, has garnered cautious approval from both Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, even as it comes after all kinds of bad news for those investing in China.The US has expanded the number of Chinese companies on its investment blacklist; there are continued concerns over China\u2019s indebted property developers; and there are fears of further regulatory crackdowns kicked off by the November 2020 cancellation of Ant Group\u2019s IPO.However, Goldman Sachs has called the CSI 300 revamp China\u2019s \u201cmost significant index balancing so far\u201d, noting that 28 constituents had been replaced, resulting in a heavier weighting to industrials and materials at the expense of the financial and consumer sectors.Goldman said that 20 of the new additions were companies it had identified as likely to benefit from Chinese president Xi Jinping\u2019s drive to create \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d, which meant they were \u201cfavourably exposed to strategic policy tailwinds\u201d.Due to a higher weighting of growth stocks, JPMorgan also reacted favourably to the rebalancing, revising forecast annual earnings per share growth from 13 per cent and 14 per cent for 2022 and 2023 respectively, to 15 per cent and 16 per cent.The index moves came as no surprise to Phillip Wool, managing director of Rayliant, whose flagship Rayliant Quantamental China Equity ETF (RAYC) is focused almost exclusively on onshore Chinese stocks. The active ETF is benchmarked to the CSI 300.Wool said overseas investors often had a poor understanding of the difference between onshore and offshore-listed Chinese companies and when they decided to invest in the China growth story they often, consequently, made poor choices.\u201cThe more familiar investors are with the differences between onshore and offshore stocks \u2014 and indices, like the CSI 300, tracking the onshore market \u2014 the better positioned they\u2019ll be to make an informed choice,\u201d Wool said.Morgan Stanley analysts said that while their broad market view remained relatively cautious \u201cwe still prefer [onshore] A-shares versus offshore\u201d.This could seem counter-intuitive for some investors. Jackie Choy, ETF strategist at Morningstar, pointed out that some of the best-known Chinese companies, such as Alibaba and Tencent, only had overseas listings.Choy believed most overseas China equity investors were more familiar with the MSCI China index \u2014 a much broader index with 739 constituents. It includes most of the CSI 300 companies but also Hong Kong-listed H shares and foreign listings, for example, American depositary receipts, with A-shares accounting for only 20 per cent of the free float.\u201cInvestors should not be looking at just the name of the ETF,\u201d said Choy. \u201cDo the homework. China can mean very different things.\u201dGoldman\u2019s analysts estimated that approximately $30bn of passive money tracks the CSI 300, meaning inflows of between $1bn and $600mn to the top 10 additions.The largest of those new additions, reflecting the higher weighting for industrials, is Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), which has gone straight in with a weighting of 3.7 per cent. It specialises in the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage systems.While the vast majority of the passive money tracking the index is from domestic providers, such as the $9.4bn Huatai-PineBridge CSI 300 ETF and the $4bn ChinaAMC CSI 300 ETF, overseas investors can also invest via the likes of the $3.2bn Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-shares ETF.There remains caveat emptor for investors who do decide to try to gain exposure to Chinese onshore equities.Choy said that while it had become easier over the past few years to access onshore-listed Chinese companies from abroad, through the Hong Kong Stock Connect scheme, there were still limitations that could influence liquidity.In addition, while the CSI 300, offers some protection from regulatory headwinds buffeting China\u2019s internet giants, it contains 14 stocks on the current US blacklist of companies deemed to have ties to the military.\u201cAt 4 per cent weight, excluding blacklisted stocks could have a visible effect on performance [for passive US investors],\u201d said Wool, noting that the list included SMIC, China\u2019s largest chipmaker, and China Railway Construction Corporation, although he added that while the excluded stocks had outperformed the broader market, this situation could reverse.Non-US investors are still permitted to trade those stocks.A further significant consideration is that retail participation in the onshore market is high and while Rayliant believed it created mispricing and opportunities for its active strategies Wool said investors should understand the risks.For example, he said, in 2020 the Shanghai stock exchange reported 30mn new retail brokerage accounts were opened, a figure that topped 33mn last year. Rayliant has estimated that more than 80 per cent of trading volume in China is accounted for by individual investors, compared to about 2 per cent in the US, prior to the retail frenzy prompted by the meme-stock phenomenon, Wool said.The A-share market is very domestic and very retail, agreed Choy. \u201cIt could be very volatile.\u201dThe dilemma for overseas investors, as James McManus, chief investment officer of Nutmeg, a UK online investment service, said, was that China appeared well-positioned to deliver long-term economic growth.However, \u201cit remains to be seen whether wealth creation and consumption themes can really be accessed through its stock markets\u201d, McManus said.",

            "description": "The logo of Tencent is seen at Tencent office in Shanghai, China December 13, 2021. REUTERS/Aly Song Acquire Licensing RightsSHANGHAI, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Tencent Holdings (0700.HK), China's biggest social media and video games company, on Tuesday said it fired nearly 70 staff over bribery and embezzlement incidents last year and named 13 companies it had blacklisted from future contracts.Tencent said in a social media post that it had also reported more than 10 people to authorities over their actions.As the Chinese government has intensified a crackdown on corruption in recent years, tech companies have doubled down on their own investigations into irregularities as their valuations and profiles have soared following the country's tech boom.Tencent started its anti-graft campaign in 2019 and has been regularly reporting the results of its probes.In 2021, one case involved a former employee from its digital music department asking for and getting favours from its suppliers, Tencent said. Another involved a sports content staffer profiting from using a company he controlled to enter a deal with Tencent, the company added.Beijing, which has since last year reasserted control over its once-freewheeling internet sector through a wide-ranging regulatory crackdown, said last week it would investigate and punish any corrupt behaviour found behind internet platform monopolies. read moreReporting by Brenda Goh; Editing by Kenneth MaxwellOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

Based on Chuck Palahniuk\u2019s book by the same name, \u201cFight Club\u201d culminates in the unnamed narrator killing off his alter ego Tyler Durden and setting off a chain of explosions destroying all bank and credit records, resetting the economy. None of that is present in the new Chinese version, which treats the movie\u2019s Project Mayhem undertaking as a thwarted and misguided attempt at criminality.\u201cThrough the clue provided by Tyler, the police rapidly figured out the whole plan and arrested all criminals, successfully preventing the bomb from exploding,\u201d the Tencent Video version tells viewers, before adding its own creative twist: \u201cAfter the trial, Tyler was sent to lunatic asylum receiving psychological treatment.\u201dA Tencent Holdings spokesperson declined to comment. Vice, which earlier reported the reconfigured ending, said that the film\u2019s rights were held by Pacific Audio & Video Co., an affiliate of the state-owned Guangdong TV, and the edited version was approved by the government before being sold to streaming sites, citing an unnamed person familiar with the matter.\u201cLord of War,\u201d telling the story of an arms smuggler played by Nicolas Cage, is another U.S. film that has undergone a similar contraction. Streaming viewers in China have complained about its final 30 minutes missing, replaced with white text on a black screen saying \u201cYuri Orlov confessed all the crimes officially charged against him in court, and was sentenced to life imprisonment in the end.\u201dForeign filmmakers have watered down or altered content for years to get past Beijing censors, but it\u2019s rare for entire endings to get reversed\u2014particularly on older films that millions would have seen pirated copies of already.\u201cWhen people tell you that the hero of Shawshank ended up in prison again, there\u2019s no explosion in Fight Club, and Nicolas Cage was arrested, you\u2019ll question if your memory exists for real,\u201d said one commentator on China\u2019s Twitter-like Weibo.Contact us at letters@time.com.",

            "description": "If you haven\u2019t seen the 1999 movie Fight Club yet, here\u2019s a spoiler: after staying one step ahead of authorities for the whole movie, the anti-establishment protagonists are finally arrested by the police and their plan to spark a social revolution fails.At least, that\u2019s how the story ends in China, where film censors edited the ending to better suit their mores before allowing the movie to stream on Tencent Video over the weekend.In the original David Fincher classic, starring Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, the two anti-heroes win. The movie ends with Norton\u2019s character\u2014the Narrator\u2014watching as explosives he planted in skyscrapers detonate, demolishing the buildings that house records of major credit card companies, and, theoretically, hitting reset on consumer debt.On Tencent Video in China, that scene is cut. Instead, a black screen shows a message explaining how the movie ends: \u201cThe police rapidly figured out the whole plan and arrested all criminals, successfully preventing the bomb from exploding.\u201dThe written epilogue\u2014always a lazy way to end a movie\u2014also notes that Pitt\u2019s character, Tyler Durden, was sent to a psychiatric hospital, where he was treated and discharged. However, censors didn\u2019t bother to edit out the big reveal that Durden isn\u2019t real; he is a figment of the Narrator\u2019s schizophrenic imagination.Admittedly, Chinese film buffs should be accustomed to foreign film censorship. Hollywood movies routinely suffer censorship to gain access to the lucrative China market, where regulators only permit 34 foreign films per year to screen at Chinese cinemas and favor features that steer clear of gore, smut, or anti-China rhetoric.The regulator\u2019s exacting standards, combined with the huge box office potential of the Chinese market, has resulted in some ludicrous film edits. In 2013, for example, the makers of Disney\u2019s Iron Man 3 spliced a scene into the film exclusively for the Chinese market that showed Chinese doctors saving the titular superhero\u2019s life.The Tencent Video cut of Fight Club isn\u2019t the first time China\u2019s censorship machine has edited content on streaming services, either. Last November, Hong Kong Disney+ viewers noticed that an episode of The Simpson\u2019s from 2005 had been edited to remove a joke about Tiananmen Square.But film fans weren\u2019t happy with the crudeness of the new Fight Club cut. On the Tencent streaming platform, one viewer commented the tactless edit was \u201ctoo outrageous.\u201dIt remains unclear who is responsible for the edit\u2014whether it\u2019s Tencent, Chinese authorities, or the film\u2019s producers. But the message is clear: if you\u2019re in China and you\u2019ve seen the original ending to Fight Club, don\u2019t talk about it.",

A screenshot of the Tencent Video-edited version of Fight Club's ending message. (credit: SCREENSHOT/TENCENT VIDEO)Film censorship in China is systematic, as the government only allows a few dozen foreign films to be broadcast domestically every year. 2019's Freddie Mercury biopic \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" for example, was cut to remove any mention of the Queen singer's sexuality and AIDS diagnosis.Censorship of media, press and other mediums is quite common around the world, though China\u2019s \u201cGreat Firewall\u201d \u2013 which has left it among the only countries that censor popular websites Google, Facebook, Twitter and others \u2013 have made the People\u2019s Republic particularly known for its stringent censorship.Despite the infamous censorship, VPN (Virtual Private Network) usage is an open secret in China, as it allows Chinese residents to bypass China\u2019s censorship apparatus and gain access to foreign websites and apps.

            "description": "Tencent, the Chinese entertainment and tech group, was given approval last week to move ahead with its planned $1.27 billion (\u00a3900 million) acquisition of games group Sumo Group. The purchase, first announced in July last year, is one of the Chinese giant\u2019s largest moves to date in the U.K.Sumo is best known for \u201cSackboy: A Big Adventure,\u201d a title published by Sony, as well as racing games based on Sega\u2019s \u201cSonic the Hedgehog\u201d franchise. Tencent has owned 8.75% of the company since 2019. It offered \u00a35.13 per Sumo share for the stock which is listed on the AIM section of the London Stock Exchange.Sumo said in a statement that the High Court in England and Wales had approved the deal and that its shares would cease to be traded. It has also been reported that Ian Livingstone, Michael Sherwin and Andrea Dunstan will no longer be non-executive directors.The deal had also been examined in the U.S. by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, due Tencent\u2019s Chinese nationality and to Sumo subsidiary Pipeworks Studios\u2019 presence in Oregon. It received U.S. approval in December.Tencent is already the world\u2019s largest gaming firm, with a portfolio of companies including stakes in Ubisoft, Activision Blizzard, Riot and Epic. Analysts say that Tencent has accelerated its games acquisition spree since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, despite a regulatory crimp at home. PC Gamer reported that Tencent acquired 31 games studios in 2020.Sumo was founded in Sheffield in 2003 and was acquired by U.S. game firm Foundation 9 Entertainment in 2008. It was bought back by management in 2014 and got its U.K. stock market listing in 2017.Sumo\u2019s three co-founders are expected to stay with the business. \u201cTencent has a strong track record for backing management teams and their existing strategies. Alongside the acceleration of own-IP work, Tencent has demonstrated its commitment to backing our client work and has stated its intention to ensure that we have the necessary investment to continue focusing on work with our key strategic partners on turn-key and co-development projects,\u201d said Sumo co-founder Carl Cavers in a statement in July.Following the High Court approval, Tencent sources again told Variety that the group expects to continue a hands-off stance and to leave local management in place.Tencent has a significant but low-key presence in the U.K., though it is considerably narrower than the group\u2019s wide-reaching span of activities in China, which stretch from games, video and social media to business solutions and payments. In the U.K., its two main sectors are games industry investment and research and development, often conducted in partnership with local companies, institutions and government.Its operations include Congenica, a U.K startup that pioneered the genomic study of rare diseases; TrueLayer, a U.K. startup developing open banking systems; Oxford Nanopore, which uses genomes for COVID sequencing; and the British Fashion Council, supplying technology to fashion designers. In December, it was announced that Tencent would join a funding round and take a minority interest in U.K. online banking firm Monzo.A Tencent-supplied fact sheet lists current investments in at least 16 U.K. companies, including Vaccitech, Miniclip, Ultraleap and Payload Studios.A corporate website reveals that Tencent currently has 15 vacancies for U.K. staff positions. These include two in mergers and acquisitions, a head of corporate communications and a senior human resources manager.Private sector companies in China are often put on the front line of enforcing government policy in matters such as censorship and corruption.This week, Tencent said that it had fired nearly 70 employees during 2021 for behavior that included accepting bribes and offering fake online internships. It referred at least ten cases to police for suspected criminal investigation and said that it had blacklisted 13 outside companies from future cooperation.The group\u2019s market-leading Tencent Video was recently revealed to be home to a recut version of David Fincher\u2019s 1999 film \u201cFight Club.\u201d",

            "description": "Tencent Holdings Ltd plans to take DouYu International Holdings Ltd private amid disagreements over strategy among executives at the Chinese videogame streaming firm, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.Tencent, the biggest shareholder in Nasdaq-listed DouYu with a 37% stake, wants to team up with at least one private equity firm for the deal and is currently talking to investment banks, they said.It is aiming to complete the deal this year, said one of the people.Shares in DouYu, one of Tencent's main platforms for game marketing and China's No. 2 videogame streaming site, surged on the news, jumping 12.7% in pre-market trade.The company has been debating its business strategy after Tencent's plans to merge it with bigger rival Huya Inc were blocked by regulators in July last year on antitrust grounds.There have been differences among DouYu executives over whether to stick with game livestreaming as its core business or shift towards more profitable entertainment livestreaming, said the other person.That tension has not abated even after DouYu co-founder and co-CEO Zhang Wenming, who had favored diversifying revenue streams, resigned last month, the person added. DouYu has said Zhang's departure was due to personal reasons. Co-founder Chen Shaojie now runs the company.The take-private plans reflect Tencent's desire to have a firm grip on its core gaming affiliates at a time when it faces a raft of regulatory issues, said the people, who were not authorized to speak on the matter and declined to be identified.A 60% slide in DouYu's stock price since July, giving it a market value of $717 million on Wednesday, has also meant it is attractively priced for a take-private deal, they added.Tencent and DouYu declined to comment. Zhang and Chen did not immediately respond to a request for comment made via DouYu.Tencent, owner of hit games \"Honor of Kings\" and \"PUBG Mobile\", has like other Chinese internet firms been grappling with a regulatory crackdown on the sector and in the third quarter posted revenue growth of just 13%, slowest since it went public in 2004.In addition to the blocking of the DouYu-Huya deal, it has also had to contend with efforts by authorities to rein in gaming by minors, while curbs on other industries have also dampened advertising appetite.At the same time, competition is growing both at home and globally.ByteDance, owner of Douyin, the domestic version of TikTok, and which also has a games unit, has made sizeable inroads into the video games business. Microsoft Corp last week said it would acquire \"Call of Duty\" maker Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in cash - the biggest gaming industry deal in history.New rules in the offing from China's cyberspace regulator will also require the nation's big internet companies to seek approval for new investments and fundraising, sources have told Reuters. The regulator has denied issuing a document to that effect.\"In such a challenging regulatory and competitive environment, it is becoming more important for Tencent to strengthen the control of existing gaming-related portfolio companies such as DouYu,\" said the second person.There have been some $13.7 billion in take-private deals for U.S.-listed Chinese companies over the past two years, compared to a combined $5.8 billion for 2018 and 2019, according to Refinitiv data.Undervalued shares and increased scrutiny by U.S. regulators have often been cited as reasons for the deals. The average premiums paid by buyers jumped to 53% last year from 36% in 2020, the data showed.(Reuters)",

The politicians claimed the move represented censorship amid growing diplomatic tensions between Canberra and Beijing with a national election to be held in Australia by May.The account, which bore Morrison's photograph and posted information on his policies in Mandarin targeted at Australian voters of Chinese ethnic origin, had 76,000 followers.The account was renamed 'Australia China New Life' in January by its new Chinese owner, Fuzhou 985 Technology, based in Fujian province, which notified followers the account would instead promote Chinese life in Australia.An employee from Fuzhou 985 Technology, who only gave his surname as Huang, told Reuters by telephone was not aware the account was previously connected to Morrison. He said the transfer of ownership was conducted with a Chinese male national living in Fuzhou, whose identity he declined to disclose.\"We thought this account had a large fanbase, so we decided to buy it,\" said Huang, adding that the company was looking for an account whose target audience was the Chinese community in Australia. He declined to say how much his company had paid to take over the account.Australia's two major political parties have used the Chinese social media platform to communicate with Australian voters of Chinese ethnicity in tightly fought electorates since 2019. The ruling Liberal Party would have aimed to use the Morrison account to promote its policies during the Chinese New Year celebrations starting Feb. 1.Both the Liberals and the main opposition Labor Party set up WeChat accounts for their leaders through outsourced agencies. The Scott Morrison account was registered in 2019 using the name of a Chinese citizen in mainland China as its account operator, WeChat records show and a government source confirmed.The agency handling Morrison's social media account lost access to it last July, and emailed WeChat on Jan. 10 saying it acted on behalf of the Prime Minister, and requesting the account be returned, two sources with knowledge of the matter said. They declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.No response was given by Tencent, the sources confirmed.In a statement on Monday, Tencent said, \"This appears to be a dispute over account ownership - the account in question was originally registered by a PRC (Chinese) individual and was subsequently transferred to its current operator, a technology services company.\"Tencent added the dispute would be handled \"in accordance with our platform rules\", and it would look into the matter further.In Beijing, China's foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular press conference on Monday that, \"The issue of Australian politicians' WeChat accounts is between them and WeChat.\"Meanwhile Liberal Senator James Paterson, Chair of Parliament's Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, told media the incident was an example of \"censorship\" and \"foreign interference\".\"There's 1.2 million Australians of Chinese descent who overwhelmingly use this service and now can no longer access news and information from their Prime Minister,\" he said on Australian radio on Monday.Fergus Ryan, senior analyst with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said having the Prime Minister's WeChat account registered under the name of a Chinese citizen was \"always risky and ill-advised\", and appeared to be a breach of WeChat rules.At Fuzhou 985 Technology, Huang said the company planned to delete the contents of the account, but would wait.\"Originally we wanted to delete [Morrison's previous posts], now we are faced with this situation, we can only wait for Tencent's final reply,\" he said.(This story was refiled to correct spelling of 'minister' in paragraph 1)Reporting by Kirsty Needham in Sydney and Eduardo Baptista and Gabriel Crossley in Beijing; Editing by Kenneth MaxwellOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

While Spotify releases official subscriber numbers at the end of each quarter (most recently in October last year), competitors like Apple and Amazon are less forthcoming with exact figures, and the most recent official figures compiled by Music Ally are from 2019 and 2020 respectively.Apple and Amazon Music have reported market shares of 15 and 13 percentBased on Midia\u2019s claim that there were 523.9 million total music streaming subscribers in Q2 2021, this suggests Spotify had just over 162.4 million subscribers paying for its music streaming service (although the company\u2019s official figure for Q2 was 165 million). Midia\u2019s estimates would then put Apple Music at almost 78.6 million subscribers for the quarter, and Amazon Music and China-exclusive Tencent Music at a little over 68.1 million each. YouTube Music follows up in fifth place with an 8 percent market share corresponding to 41.9 million subscribers.According to Midia, the music streaming market is continuing to grow, and increased by 26.4 percent to the second quarter of last year. Although Spotify\u2019s commanding lead means it\u2019s unlikely to be overtaken anytime soon, Midia notes that its market share dropped from 33 percent in Q2 2020 to 31 percent in Q2 2021, and its growth was outperformed by Amazon and YouTube Music, with the latter growing by over 50 percent compared to a year earlier. Growth in emerging markets was reportedly also strong, with Yandex, Tencent, and NetEast growing by a combined 37 percent.",

Chinese tech conglomerate Tencent owns both Tencent Games and WeChat.The warning comes after Beijing issued new rules last year to restrict online gaming among kids and teens.Advertisement\"Elementary school kids have had their game time restricted for an entire semester. And now they're eager to indulge in some gaming fun during their winter break and the upcoming Spring Festival,\" Tencent's post reads in Chinese. \"Guess what? For this winter break, you can only play for a maximum of 14 hours!\" the post continues.The post included a calendar marking out in red which days have been approved for online gaming for Tencent Games' young subscribers.Only 14 days between January 17 to February 15 are pre-approved days for gaming, according to the calendar.Kids are allowed access to Tencent's gaming platform on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, and during the week-long Spring Festival, which starts January 31. TencentTencent Games' gaming time limits coincide with Beijing's recent crackdown on gaming. Last August, the Chinese state agency National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA) announced that online game providers may only offer one-hour time slots \u2014 from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. \u2014 to minors on Fridays, weekends, and official holidays.AdvertisementIn its WeChat post on Monday, the company did not share how it would deal with children who flout these rules. But the company did stress that it would prevent that from happening by deploying facial recognition software so that kids will not be able to use accounts held by adults to play.Tencent Games is the world's second-largest gaming company by revenue. According to its annual report, the company's online games arm brought in about $24 billion in revenue in 2020, putting it neck in neck with Sony, which netted about $24.4 billion in gaming-related revenue in the same period.Tencent reported that minors only accounted for 0.7% of time spent on domestic games in September \u2014 the month after Beijing's announced gaming restrictions \u2014 declining from 6.4% a year ago.Got a tip about Tencent or any other technology firm in Asia?

            "description": "Last Fall, the \"metaverse\" became a buzzword when Facebook changed its company name to Meta Platforms. While the ultimate shape and scope of the metaverse is yet to be determined, it seems likely virtual worlds will grow in the future. Oculus became the most downloaded app on Christmas Day, indicating that more and more people may be trying out this whole metaverse idea.In China, the best positioned company to benefit from the metaverse is clearly Tencent (TCEHY -0.22%). While Meta dominates global social media with its Facebook and Instagram platforms, Tencent dominates China, with its WeChat \"super-app\" used by more than 1.26 billion people.And Tencent one-ups Meta when it comes to mobile gaming, which could be another key metaverse application. Tencent is the number one game publisher in China, as well as a large investor in many of the biggest gaming studios across the world.Yet while Tencent has the upper hand over Meta in mobile gaming, it hasn't yet developed virtual reality headset unit, as Meta has with its Oculus platform.That is, until now.Tencent is buying Black SharkLast Monday, Chinese media outlet 36Kr reported that Tencent would be acquiring Black Shark. Started in 2017 and funded by Chinese phone maker Xiaomi (XIACY), Black Shark currently makes gaming-oriented mobile phones and accessories. However, according to the report, Black Shark will be changing its business model to invest in AR/VR headsets after Tencent buys it.According to sources, Tencent is paying between RMB2.6 and 2.7 billion ($410 to $425 million). That's far below the $2 billion paid for Oculus back in 2014 -- especially when adjusting for inflation.Of course, Black Shark doesn't even make a headset yet, which will require additional investment. So why did Tencent choose Black Shark, a company that has to date only made phones, and not headsets?According to 36kr, Black Shark had become somewhat redundant for Xiaomi. Its other phone brands Mi and Redmi had developed enhanced gaming features, while the number of Chinese citizens who bought specialized gaming phones was relatively small.However, Black Shark had also developed expertise in adapting games for high-end mobile experiences, especially in working with Qualcomm chips. Qualcomm's modems should continue to be crucial for virtual reality and metaverse applications, just as they were in mobile phones. So that type of technological expertise could prove invaluable in the emerging metaverse.Black Shark could be a missing piece of the metaverse puzzle for TencentBlack Shark is not as fully developed in terms of its VR technology as Oculus was, but the acquisition does seem like a low-cost way for Tencent to get into the augmented- and virtual-reality hardware market. And Tencent already has lots of software and platform expertise as the leading video game distributor in China, along with its large ownership stakes across many major game studios. These include Epic Games and Roblox, owners of the Unreal engine and Roblox Studio game engines, respectively.On its third quarter conference call with analysts, Tencent CEO Pony Ma answered an analyst question about the company's metaverse plans:In terms of our capabilities and our positioning, right, we felt we actually have a lot of the technology and know-how building blocks for us to explore and develop for the metaverse opportunity. For example, we have a lot of gaming experiences. We also have very strong social networking experience. In addition to that, in terms of technology building blocks, we have engine capability. We have AI capability. We have the capability to build a large server architecture that can serve a huge number of concurrent users. We are very experienced in managing digital content economies as well as real-life digital assets. So all in all, we felt that we have a lot of tech and capability building blocks that will allow us to approach the metaverse opportunity through the multiple pathways we talked about.When you combine Tencent's expertise in gaming, social networking, cloud infrastructure, artificial intelligence, streaming videos, and digital payments, you can see how it would perhaps be the best positioned company to tackle the metaverse. The only missing piece is really on the hardware side, where Tencent hasn't really ventured to date. Outside of a few proprietary semiconductor designs for internal use, most of Tencent's current businesses are in software internet platforms, which tend to be very high-margin and capital-light.Yet the technological needs of the metaverse may be larger, requiring companies to optimize software with proprietary hardware solutions. Hence, why Black Shark could be the \"missing piece\" of Tencent's metaverse puzzle. Only time will tell how this all plays out.",

            "description": "China\u2019s copyright regulators have banned digital music platforms from signing exclusive copyright licensing agreements, except under special circumstances, as the country tightens its grip on market monopoly.The National Copyright Administration of China on Thursday said the new rule was devised in the wake of \u201ccomplicated copyright issues involving music works\u201d and to \u201cpromote a good digital music copyright ecology.\u201d The authority, however, didn\u2019t mention whether the move was part of the broader antitrust clampdown.The decision comes six years after Chinese authorities banned digital music platforms from distributing unlicensed songs over the infringement of intellectual property rights, which led streaming platforms \u2014 including those owned by tech giant Tencent and NetEase \u2014 to acquire exclusive music rights to keep existing users and attract new consumers. The three popular streaming platforms operated by Tencent \u2013 QQ Music, KuGou Music, and Kuwo Music \u2014 hold more than 80% of exclusive music library resources, according to the State Administration for Market Regulation.\u201cIn today\u2019s digital music industry, owning more copyrights means having more songs on (the company\u2019s) platform,\u201d Zhao Zhigong, a Shanghai-based music copyright lawyer, told Sixth Tone. \u201cAnd consumers would only visit platforms where they have plenty of choice. Those with huge capital to buy copyrights enjoy monopoly power.\u201dAmid the central government\u2019s push to crack down on monopolistic behavior last year, authorities in July ordered Tencent to give up its exclusive music licensing deals with music labels and fined the company 500,000 yuan ($77,150). The following month, Tencent announced it had complied with the authorities and granted licensing rights to the record labels, though some artists were still only found on Tencent\u2019s music platforms.Some legal experts believe while banning music platforms from signing exclusive agreements with artists and labels indicates its push for antitrust regulation, authorities should also amend related laws to include new provisions.\u201cAs the law hasn\u2019t been amended, the authorities should intervene frequently based on market trends in order to prevent monopoly,\u201d Xu Xinming, an intellectual property lawyer at Beijing Mingtai Law Firm, told Sixth Tone, referring to the newly amended Copyright Law that went into effect last June. \u201cThe ultimate goal is to achieve a highly self-controlled market as well as a balance of interests of all parties.\u201dEditor: Bibek Bhandari.(Header image: IC)",

S3studio | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesTencent -owned WeChat, China's largest messaging app and one of the country's biggest payment services, will begin supporting the country's sovereign digital currency. China has been working on the digital yuan since 2014 and is yet to roll it out nationwide. But the move by WeChat, which has over 1 billion users, to support the digital currency could provide it with a huge boost if people begin to pay with it. WeChat may not be that well know to users outside of China, but inside the world's second-largest economy it is ubiquitous. It is often dubbed a \"super app\" because many services are wrapped into it. People can use messaging functions and make payments via WeChat Pay, but also hail taxis and order food.WeChat Pay allows users to show merchants a barcode on their phone to pay for items in store. It can also be used for purchases online. WeChat Pay has over 800 million monthly active users. To date, the People's Bank of China, which issues the digital yuan or e-CNY, has done limited trials in certain cities via lotteries where the central bank has handed out small amounts of the currency to some citizens. But there are now signs that the PBOC is looking to expand usage of the digital yuan, despite no concrete date for a nationwide rollout. This week, the PBOC launched an e-CNY app for users in certain regions and cities in China. That will enable anyone in those areas to download and sign up to use the digital currency. Previously, users could get the app on an invite-only basis. In China, WeChat and Alipay, which is run by Alibaba affiliate Ant Group, dominate mobile payments; last year, Alipay also began trialing digital yuan payments. But WeChat and Alipay are also potential competitors to the digital yuan's own app.watch now",

The 457 million shares that Tencent (TCEHY) plans to give out represent 86.4% of its stake at JD.com (JD), or 14.7% of JD.com (JD)\u2019s total issued shares.Currently, Tencent controls 17% of JD.com. After the distribution, its stake will drop to to 2.3%, which means it will no longer be JD.com\u2019s largest shareholder.JD.com founder Richard Liu Qiangdong, who holds 13.9% of shares, will become the biggest stakeholder, according to the company\u2019s latest annual report. Walmart follows, with a 9.3% stake.This surprising retreat by Tencent comes at a time when the country\u2019s internet giants are under intense pressure from Beijing.For the past year, China has increased scrutiny of the tech industry, published detailed rules aimed at tackling unfair competition, slapped companies with massive fines, and demanded that some firms completely overhaul their businesses.In its filing on Thursday, Tencent said that JD.com has reached a status where it can finance its own growth.It is, therefore, \u201can appropriate time\u201d to transfer the majority of the stake to its shareholders, Tencent said.The move may reduce Tencent\u2019s \u201cdominance\u201d in the market and \u201cis potentially an attempt to shift towards fairer competition, as well as to be more in line with the agenda for China authorities,\u201d said Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist for IG, in a research note on Thursday.As part of the deal, Tencent President Martin Lau will step down as a director of JD.com, according to the filing.The two companies will \u201ccontinue to maintain their mutually beneficial business relationship,\u201d including their ongoing strategic partnership agreement, Tencent and JD.com said in separate statements on Thursday.Tencent\u2019s stock surged more than 4% in Hong Kong on Thursday, while JD.com\u2019s shares tumbled 7%.",

            "description": "There's a lot going on in the world of Back 4 Blood developer Turtle Rock today; not only has the studio announced it's been acquired by Chinese conglomerate Tencent, it's also just released the first big post-launch content update for its well-received co-op zombie shooter. The latter brings with it a range of tweaks and additions, the most notable of which is a much-requested solo offline mode with campaign progression.First the acquisition news; as of today, following Tencent's purchase of Turtle Rock's parent company Slamfire, the studio is now wholly owned by the Chinese conglomerate. According to the announcement, Turtle Rock will continue to operate independently at its Lake Forest, California, offices, with co-founders Phil Robb and Chris Ashton remaining at the helm.The news does, of course, further solidify Tencent's already significant presence in gaming, with the company - which recently launched publishing division Level Infinite - already outright owning the likes of League of Legends studio Riot Games, Funcom, Splash Damage, Supercell, and Warframe developer Digital Extremes. And that's not including the various publishers and developers it owns smaller stakes in, including Epic Games, Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft, Paradox Interactive, Remedy Entertainment, Frontier Developments, Dontnod, Bloober Team, Klei, Playtonic, Platinum Games, Roblox Corporation, and more.Tencent says the acquisition will have no effect on the development of Back 4 Blood, which brings us to the second part of today's Turtle-Rock-related news: the zombie shooter's latest update and the introduction of its long-awaited solo offline mode with campaign progression.Back 4 Blood Gameplay: Evansburgh Act 1.On its release in October, Back 4 Blood was heavily criticised after players discovered that, even when playing solo with AI teammates, the game remained strictly always-online. Worse, restrictions to solo mode meant players wishing to go it alone were prevented from earning progress towards Accomplishments, earning Supply Points, and even tracking stats.In response to complaints, Turtle Rock said it was \"discussing ways to address the issue\" and, just a month later, confirmed a solution was on the way - and that solution is now available to all players as part of Back 4 Blood's first big post-launch content update, which follows on from a patch in November focused on delivering quality of life improvements and major bug fixes.The highlight for solo players will undoubtedly be the new offline campaign mode with progression. Here, while working through the game with (newly randomised) AI bots, players will now finally have the ability to earn Supply Points, work towards Accomplishments, and have their stats tracked away from the online mode.That's not the end of the new additions, however; players can also expect a new card type - Burn Cards - which are available through the new time-limited Roving Merchants Supply Lines. These can be used while in Saferooms to gain temporary effects such as instant healing, currency boosts, and increased resistances.Elsewhere, players can expect a new Ridden practice area in Fort Hope, improvements to ultrawide support, and new non-Burn Cards - namely, Belt Clip, Utility Belt, and Tool Belts, which, in that order, increase the Quickshot Inventory by 1, increase the Quickshot inventory by 2 but decrease dealt damage by 10%, and increase the Team Quickshot Inventory by 1.And finally, what December update would be complete without some sort of seasonal celebration? Certainly not this one, which also ushers in the start of Back 4 Blood's own Holiday Event. Expect appropriately festive decorations at Fort Hope and the Firing Range, plus unlockable seasonal character skins, weapon skins, emblems, and sprays.\"We'll continue to improve the Back 4 Blood experience,\" Turtle Rock concludes in its lengthy patch notes for December's update, \"and look forward to your feedback\".",

            "description": "In this article 1698-HK Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNTChinese tech companies are expanding around the world, including in Southeast Asia. As they post openings, more Singaporeans wonder what it's like to work for them. Albert photo | Moment Open | Getty ImagesWhile interviewing for a job at Chinese tech giant Tencent, a now-former employee asked if he would be expected to use Mandarin at work in the Singapore office. He was satisfied with the answer that a mix of Mandarin and English would be required. He accepted the position. But the reality was different \u2014 Mandarin was used in the office very frequently, the former employee said. The man, a Singaporean, ended up leaving Tencent because of difficulty communicating. \"If I need to spend so much time trying to understand things, I'm going to be very inefficient,\" he said, adding that a person who's better with Mandarin \"is probably a better fit.\"Working at a Chinese tech firmChinese tech companies are expanding their offices around the world, including in Southeast Asia. As they post openings overseas, more people are wondering what it's like to work for them. This year, CNBC reported on tech workers in the United Kingdom who turned down job offers at TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, after encountering stories about an intense work environment there. Those people cited fears of the so-called \"996\" work culture practiced by some companies in China, which requires employees to work from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. A TikTok spokesperson told CNBC in May of this year that \"we absolutely do not have '996\u2032 policies.\" CNBC interviewed 10 current and former employees of Chinese tech firms to ask what work life is like in those companies' Singapore offices. Most requested anonymity owing to fear of repercussions or because they do not have permission to speak to the media.watch nowTheir stories varied a great deal according to the company, the role and the individual. Four former or current Huawei employees told CNBC that colleagues from China often napped in the office during lunch breaks, as is common in Chinese office culture. Now that people mostly work from home, two of them said, employees log on to a video call every morning. They said they believe the purpose of the call is so they can show that they are ready for work at 9 a.m. and to discuss plans for the day. They added that their managers take a screen shot of everyone in the call. But individuals who spoke to CNBC didn't exclusively describe work cultures that are rigid or difficult. Three people who have worked at ByteDance or Tencent described a hierarchy at those companies that was \"flat,\" with little emphasis on titles or positions. One ByteDance employee said he can speak to a vice president in the company freely, something he doesn't think is typical at other firms. ByteDance declined to comment for this report. But three things came up repeatedly in conversations with workers and former workers from Huawei, Tencent and one Tencent subsidiary: a heavy reliance on Mandarin, the use of fixed-term contracts, and work outside normal business hours.Speaking MandarinThe hiring process at Tencent took place in English, but almost \"everything\" else was in Mandarin at Tencent's Singapore office, according to the former employee who left the company because of the language barrier. Even documents essential to his work were in Mandarin, and his command of the language is \"average,\" he told CNBC. More than 74% of Singapore's population is ethnically Chinese, but most major businesses in Singapore operate in English. The individual pointed out that Tencent's presence in Singapore is \"quite new,\" and he speculated that the company may not have had time to \"localize\" yet. The gaming and social media company announced its plans to open a regional hub in Singapore only last year.It is not a nice-to-have to be able to work in Mandarin fluently, it is actually a necessity. Patricia Teo Patricia Teo, executive director of technology practice, Kerry ConsultingAs was the case with difficulties in work culture, difficulties with language weren't reported by all the employees and former employees who spoke to CNBC. Some said they had encountered no problems. \"If you prefer English, [colleagues from China] can speak in English too,\" said a current Huawei employee. \"We try to meet in the middle.\" The current ByteDance employee who described the company's hierarchy as \"flat\" said that when it comes to language, there's \"no barrier,\" since colleagues in China can speak English. Tencent recently announced internally that it intends to shift toward using English in the international team, said one employee. She said she expects that move to take time, because most of the systems and documents are currently in Mandarin. Patricia Teo, executive director of technology practice at recruitment company Kerry Consulting, said much of the day-to-day work at Chinese tech firms is likely to involve heavy interaction with China-based teams.\"It is not a nice-to-have to be able to work in Mandarin fluently,\" she said, \"it is actually a necessity.\" Meetings, training and conversations with tech or finance staff all took place in Mandarin at one Tencent subsidiary, another former employee said, describing the situation as \"overwhelming.\" Tencent did not address this claim when reached by CNBC for comment. \"Everything was in Chinese,\" she said. \"It's quite stressful, especially when you need to get a point across and your shoddy [Mandarin] cannot get it across,\" she added. Jun, a former Huawei intern who wanted to be identified by one name, said that even if he sent English emails or text messages to his colleagues, replies tended to be in Mandarin. He interned at the company in 2017.Fixed-term contractsMultiple people who spoke to CNBC said it's common for Singaporeans to be hired at Chinese firms on contracts of one to three years, though Kerry Consulting's Teo said most roles in Singapore are permanent because there's a shortage of candidates. The former Tencent employee who left because of the heavy use of Mandarin said he was on a contract, with a chance of converting to a permanent role after a year. But he said he was not confident that the company would offer him a permanent role.Employers can use a fixed-term contract to ensure that they have a guaranteed 'out' after a certain period, so that they are not 'locked in' to contracts. Matthew Durham Attorney, Hong Kong law firm GallA former Huawei employee, Ong Xuan Jie, said he wasn't offered a permanent role after a year in the company, but he said he believes that was because the company had already hit a cap it set on permanent slots. Ong added that the contract situation at Huawei didn't seem out of line with the industry. Still, he wanted more stability since he was just starting out in his career at the time. He left the company in 2018. When contacted by CNBC, Tencent and Huawei declined to comment on contract roles. The employee at Tencent who said the company is trying to shift toward using English said she preferred a contract role, as it would give her the flexibility to move on if the job wasn't a good fit. Matthew Durham, a lawyer with experience handling employment matters in mainland China, said fixed-term contracts are common there for new hires. That's because \u2014 unlike in Singapore \u2014 employment law in China allows employers to terminate contracts only under specific, limited grounds, he said. In China, poor performance by an employee is generally not a valid reason for termination unless it can be shown to constitute incompetence, said Durham, who works for Hong Kong law firm Gall.watch now\"Employers can use a fixed-term contract to ensure that they have a guaranteed 'out' after a certain period, so that they are not 'locked in' to contracts,\" he said, adding that companies have to sign an open-term or permanent contract after two fixed-term contracts with an employee. At some companies, employees said there was little difference between workers on fixed-term contracts and those in permanent roles. But at Huawei, permanent staff and contract workers are entitled to two different sets of employee referral benefits \u2014 the bonus they get for referring a new employee to the company. According to information provided by the employee who said Mandarin-speaking colleagues can switch to English if needed, Huawei's contract staff and permanent staff get similar referral bonuses for helping to fill more junior roles. But for more senior roles, there's a disparity: A permanent staff member who successfully refers someone to a senior position can get a bonus that's three times the incentive a contract employee will get for the same referral. Durham, the lawyer from Gall, said employees on fixed-term and open-term contracts within China usually have the same benefits. However, some firms may offer better bonuses or entitlements to open-term contract employees, who likely have a longer track record in the company, he said.'No real rest time'Singaporeans who have worked at Chinese tech firms said job-seekers should be prepared to work long hours, especially when interacting with colleagues based in China. \"There is no sacred day or time,\" said the former employee who found the use of Mandarin at a Tencent subsidiary overwhelming. She said her bosses, who are based in China, sent her questions at night, during the weekend and on public holidays. \"You could just ignore it, but would you really be able to relax knowing your boss is waiting for your reply?\" she asked.watch now\"There's no real rest time, only work time and standby time,\" she added. Ang, a former employee at the same Tencent subsidiary who asked to be identified by his last name, said co-workers in China tended to put in extra hours to make up, in advance, for lost time before the Lunar New Year and Golden Week holidays. Colleagues would contact him during the weekend, he said. \"You will feel like you're working double, but you're not getting any leave,\" he said. However, not everyone reported inordinately long hours. \"There are definitely teams that work a little later, but I wouldn't think anyone is forced to work outside of what the standard timings are,\" said the ByteDance employee who said the company's hierarchy is \"flat.\" A colleague who also spoke to CNBC echoed his sentiments on work-life balance.'996' culture in Singapore? Not reallyThe hours may sometimes go long, but most people interviewed for this article said China's '996' work culture has not been adopted in Singapore. Some said they believe their hours are in line with those of other companies. Kerry Consulting's Teo said Chinese companies are taking steps to improve work-life balance because '996' culture has been the \"main deterrent\" for potential employees in Singapore. \"As a fast-paced global technology company, we know that striking a healthy work/life balance is critical for employees to do their best work,\" a Tencent spokesperson told CNBC in an email.",

            "description": "By integrating innovative technology with traditional insurance, new insurtech models promise to improve the affordability and accessibility of insurance and to transform the industry ecosystem. One of the most prominent players in this space is WeSure, Tencent\u2019s insurance-agency platform. WeSure teams up with major domestic insurance companies to enable users to purchase insurance, make inquiries, and file claims through WeChat\u2014a widely used messaging, social-media, and payments application in China.Violet Chung, a partner at McKinsey\u2019s Hong Kong office, recently had an in-depth conversation with Ren Huichuan, the senior adviser at Tencent Group. They discussed WeSure\u2019s values and business philosophy; the thinking behind its core \u201cmoats,\u201d or competitive advantages; and the wide-ranging challenges confronting both digitally native and traditional insurers.This article is part of McKinsey\u2019s Insurance Industry Leaders and Shapers interview series and has been edited for clarity.Building an innovative, customer-first insurance platformMcKinsey: How would you describe the core values of WeSure?Ren Huichuan: WeSure is Tencent\u2019s insurance-services platform. We have made many significant forays into online insurance since our incorporation about four years ago.I think our first core value is our business philosophy: we are an insurance-services platform driven by our users. In other words, we are an insurance-services platform designed to help users purchase insurance, rather than one designed to serve insurers. We adhere to the philosophy of placing user value first, which Tencent has always advocated. The company hopes to help users independently pick out and purchase the insurance product that is best for them in a quick and convenient manner, rather than sell and market products.Share About the interviewee Ren Huichuan joined Tencent in June 2020 and is now the senior adviser for the group. He previously held the positions of vice chairman (October 2019\u2013March 2020), executive director (July 2012\u2013March 2020), and general manager (March 2011\u2013December 2019) of the Ping An Group.The second core value is insurtech exploration. The WeSure tech team is actually quite large, with a staff of several hundred. About half work with technology, and many used to work at Tencent. We have put a lot of high-tech effort into exploring scenarios, data, and services, and we have created many innovative products as a result.For example, regarding products, WeSure cooperates with insurers to build a risk-control platform, focusing on risk identification, anti-fraud, and helping insurers reduce risks across businesses involving insurance application, underwriting, and claims. As for our service, WeSure has aligned the claims and service interface with insurers, simplified the process, and reduced complexity to provide users with high-quality and convenient insurance services. We\u2019ve also explored ways to better respond to COVID-19 and serve small businesses.In short, WeSure is a platform-based company with a customer-oriented philosophy set up to help customers find the insurance product or service that is right for them. We bridge the two sides of the market, connecting customers on one side and insurance providers on the other\u2014but our philosophy is fundamentally customer oriented.Developing three core moatsMcKinsey: Compared with other insurance-technology companies, what are some of your company\u2019s competitive advantages, or \u201cmoats\u201d?Ren Huichuan: Every enterprise wants to build its own moat, but moats are dynamic. Even if you have a moat now, it can be overcome by a competitor after some time, leaving you with less of an advantage. Therefore, building new moats is an ongoing process.When WeSure was first founded, it was a new member of the Tencent family. Therefore, our first moat was our good brand reputation and rich ecosystem brought by Tencent as our major shareholder. We are an insurance-services platform based on the WeChat ecosystem. We have an exclusive portal on the WeChat grid called \u201cInsurance Services,\u201d which offers a very quick and convenient channel for customer outreach.For our part, WeSure must also rely on our own strengths to build new moats. We cannot simply \u201clive off our parent.\u201d WeSure\u2019s moats are still those things I mentioned earlier. The first is to lower the barriers to insurance\u2014making it easier to purchase insurance and improving the accessibility of insurance products. For example, we had a product called \u201cWeInsurance - Million Medical Insurance.\u201d We revised the documents 46 times to ensure that the public understood the terms and conditions and how to use the product. When designing the purchase path (basically, each customer\u2019s click-and-purchase process), we wanted to minimize the time it took customers to purchase the product. We designed a number of simple medical-insurance offerings with lower barriers, stronger protection, and higher leverage, such as critical-illness insurance. Later, we further expanded the product categories to auto insurance and small-business insurance.The second moat is to combine products with scenarios. Insurance companies cannot offer highly specific insurance products and services because of cost considerations. WeSure offers small-business insurance because WeChat Pay has 50 million small-business accounts. WeSure provides account-security insurance to these small businesses with WeChat Pay as the receiving account, and it\u2019s very affordable, just 0.66 renminbi (US $0.10) per year. We also provide insurance products targeted to scenarios such as employer liability insurance, public liability insurance, and safety liability insurance.There\u2019s another moat that will not yield immediate results but will offer competitive advantages over the longer term. WeSure continues to adhere to Tencent\u2019s \u201clong-term and patient\u201d business philosophy. That is why premiums do not rise rapidly, but gradually. Customer value is WeSure\u2019s first priority. Our products undergo a rigorous selection process, and the services we offer to our customers must not contain misleading or fraudulent content. We hope our customers will take the initiative to purchase products and services based on their own knowledge and understanding, rather than being convinced to buy a product or service. So we need to enhance our services and build trust.WeSure has come up with many innovations in this area and has pioneered a few industry standards. In terms of insurance, WeSure has three major tools. The first is appraisal. This means evaluating the type of insurance a customer needs, including the level of risk of the individual and their family. The second is comparison. For example, when you are thinking about purchasing a particular type of insurance, can you compare the products of major insurers and their different metrics to make an informed decision?The third is a policy-administrator tool. For example, a household might have five to six policies. In this case, it can be difficult to remember when each policy will mature, when payments are due, and the specific coverage of each policy. The policy-administrator tool can help you manage all your insurance policies and plans. To access these services, however, the customer must be able to take the initiative to obtain insurance themselves.Challenges confronting online insuranceMcKinsey: In your opinion, what challenges lie ahead for WeSure?Ren Huichuan: Let\u2019s start with fintech. The financial-services industry is unique and has negative risk externalities, which is one of its more distinctive characteristics. The industry has a significant and systematic impact on the national economy and the lives of normal people.I\u2019ve been working in the financial-services industry for 31 years. I have been involved in the liability side (property-and-casualty insurance as well as life insurance) and on the asset side (insurance investment), including securities-market and banking-industry operations. I\u2019ve also been involved in business management. I\u2019ve noticed that people are awed by the financial industry and its risks. Ultimately, both fintech and techfin services should not deviate from the core rules and essence of financial businesses. We must respect these rules, the risks, the negative externalities, and the interested parties. Technology should serve finance. That\u2019s the first point I want to make.The second point relates to the buoyant development of fintech in China over the past few years. Many companies with large market value have sprung up. I think there are a number of reasons for this. First, China has an enormous retail market, so as long as a fintech company is consumer facing, it will have a rapidly growing customer base. Next, as driven by some external resources, enterprises can accomplish projects that normally take three years in a single year by investing huge amounts of resources.Unfortunately, there are inherent problems with this model. I think it\u2019s almost like getting a shot of steroids. There\u2019s a bit of puffiness and unhealthy growth, with inherent risks. That\u2019s why we should respect the rules and patterns of the financial industry as well as normal enterprise growth.Of the three major financial sectors\u2014banking, securities, and insurance\u2014insurance is the most closely related to the national economy, the livelihoods of normal people, China\u2019s fundamental policies, and our Chinese dream. Insurance is particularly relevant to people\u2019s lives.Of the three major financial sectors\u2014banking, securities, and insurance\u2014insurance is the most closely related to the national economy, the livelihoods of normal people, China\u2019s fundamental policies, and our Chinese dream.Of course, banking and securities operations are also very important, but insurance is more directly related to social and public administration.In China, we have basic medical insurance and social security, and on top of these, we may need some commercial insurance that provides greater coverage. Higher value-added insurance may be provided to middle-class and wealthy households. WeChat currently has 1.2 billion users, and one billion are monthly active users. To date, WeSure has served a total of about 90 million users with about 30 million currently active users. Because WeSure can easily reach out to customers and we are an inclusive insurance platform, we really want to become an insurance-services platform akin to a public utility.Our program \u201cHuiminbao,\u201d which we are now actively promoting, is based on this philosophy. Because Huiminbao has very low premiums and extensive coverage, it requires a very low cost ratio. Meanwhile, we know that traditional insurance products and the insurance industry have very high channel costs.Insurance is a financial product required by almost everyone, but it\u2019s also a product that customers do not take the initiative to understand and purchase because demand is not rigid enough. Purchasing insurance is a rational decision. Not everyone thinks about preparing for a disaster before it arrives, and the money you spend may not result in any benefit for three consecutive years. Therefore, insurance products are very difficult to sell.My third point is that the insurance business model is in transition\u2014just like the process of switching from fuel-based vehicles to new energy vehicles. Insurance demand has been increasing in tandem with the rise in per capita income. Our need for protection is rising.Over the past couple of years, however, the insurance industry has encountered an inflection point. The traditional insurance-sales approach, which is mainly based on offline channels, is not very popular among the new customer base. Therefore, we must look for methods that are better suited to this new customer base in China. For customers with greater self-awareness, we need to offer a more convenient service platform with more cost-effective products. Certainly, this is a huge challenge for WeSure. Insurance is a low-frequency purchase, but the internet is a high-frequency place. WeSure is purely online, but most traditional insurance is offline. So how do we combine online and offline, as well as services and insurance products?Another major challenge is getting customers to put in the effort to find and compare products. Tencent and WeSure have always subscribed to the philosophy that as long as we have a good product, customers will come to us. Unfortunately, insurance products suffer from a lack of rigid demand and perception issues. Just because you have a good product does not necessarily mean that customers will take the initiative to approach you. We still need to communicate with customers, provide some insurance tools, and provide a platform to build trust with customers and help them learn about insurance so that they will consciously take the initiative to purchase insurance.McKinsey: What you just mentioned sounds like a \u201cpush and pull\u201d strategy.Ren Huichuan: That\u2019s right. In the past, we were told that insurance must be pushed to the customer. It must be sold, not acquired. Now, many millennials are risk aware and are able to purchase insurance, so they can take the initiative to search online.Take a household of three or four. Taking into account the size of the mortgage payments and the one or two cars owned, how much protection does such a family require? Customers won\u2019t listen to what someone tells them; they won\u2019t believe you anyway. It\u2019s best if they search on their own, listen to the advice of KOLs [key opinion leaders], and then make their own choices based on their own judgment. I think we should go along with this consumer trend.Advice for insurersMcKinsey: Today, many traditional insurers face significant challenges, particularly around offline expansion and development. What advice would you give them?Ren Huichuan: In the past two years, a mismatch between old supply and new demand has emerged in the insurance industry, particularly in the traditional approach of insurance sales. I think demand in China\u2019s insurance market remains, but with a mismatched supply.Let\u2019s look at the major insurance classes: personal, property, and liability insurance. In terms of personal insurance, China is the most populous country in the world. It is now a moderately well-off society based on per capita income, so there is a very strong demand for insurance. In particular, two major sectors in the country need to be supplemented by commercial insurance. The first is the medical-and-healthcare sector. The needs and quality requirements of users are rising, but healthcare cannot be completely free of charge.The second is in the pension sector. China\u2019s aging population may pose significant challenges to state pension services in the future, which will have to be supplemented by insurance companies. Therefore, companies that can provide these types of insurance products to the average person at cost-effective prices will be able to support the fundamental policies of the state and meet the needs of the population. This will be the key to commercial success.However, selling insurance products requires more than simply showing what you have and waiting for customers to come to you. Instead, insurance companies need consultative sales services and to provide a platform for users. I think new channels will emerge to replace existing ones. There are plenty of innovative attempts; none have gone mainstream yet, but I think the light at the end of the tunnel is just around the bend. I believe the future online insurance market will be dominated by digital and intelligent O2O [online-to-offline] sales channels and services, and the accompanying products must be cost effective.We know that commissions and management costs account for a fairly large share of the cost of traditional insurance products, which get passed on to customers. Many Chinese nationals purchase insurance overseas. In addition to other reasons, they think they can get better coverage for less.Therefore, the first priority of traditional insurers is to make insurance products more cost effective. Both insurance platforms and insurers must lower their channel costs. This can be achieved by using the internet and a scenario-based approach, with the cost savings passed on to consumers. This is product optimization.Second, the products should be scenario based and tailored so that users enjoy an easier and more convenient purchase experience. Third, for long-term policies such as pension annuities, long-term assurance, whole-life insurance, and other high-value policies, an O2O platform should go beyond simply hiring offline sales representatives and relying on them to drive sales. I think there is still a lot of market space for approaches that prioritize service professionalism, but this is probably targeted more toward medium- to high-net-worth users and sales of more complicated insurance products. To start, we need an O2O channel, where traffic leads are from online sources and users take the initiative to purchase. Self-service is the first step. After a user becomes more interested in a product and communicates his or her needs, an online adviser may step in to address any insurance and financial questions the user may have. This may come from WeChat Work or even from offline account managers.Therefore, we must move toward specializing in financial and insurance products. The next step is to become more intelligence oriented. We usually talk about technology driving sales efficiency, but in insurance, the opposite is true. It\u2019s from online to offline, not vice versa. Of course, this is all conjecture. Who will succeed in the future? I think we all must work hard together.The key to success is to have cost-effective products that provide value to as many people as possible. Finally, I would like to remark that the insurance business is characterized by long-term operation and aims to provide guarantees for customers. We need to return to the essence of insurance, adhere to the long-term development, carry out business in a down-to-earth manner, and serve our customers wholeheartedly. Only by not forgetting why we started can we achieve sustainable, healthy development and create value for our customers and for society.",

This helping nature aligns with our company\u2019s vision\u2014value for users, tech for good.\u201dAt the top echelon of cloud solutions providers, fast-growing Tencent Cloud is a relatively young company. Just a few years after its 2013 launch, the firm became one of the largest cloud service providers in China, and one of the fastest growing in the world.Tencent Cloud has emerged as a reliable partner for businesses to connect with China, thanks to its experience and expertise in the Chinese market.Yeung makes reference to Tencent\u2019s advanced consumer-to-business, or C2B, capability for industries. This know-how has evolved due to its extensive experience in consumer Internet, messaging, audio, video and gaming technologies.Tencent is well-known for its C side business process. Meanwhile, its major social platforms \u2014WeChat, Weixin, and QQ, reach more than one billion users, providing valuable local market knowledge and operational experience. Making full use of its C-side experience to partners, Tencent provides enterprises with a comprehensive range of services. This allows the company to better serve users, improve their operational efficiency, and finally realise the closed loop of C2B2C\u2014 to be a complete business process.Tencent Cloud is also integrating the latest innovations for technologies to help businesses to reduce their costs, and increase efficiency while identifying new business opportunities. Yeung adds that Tencent Cloud aims to lower the threshold for enterprises to connect with users. All while offering more online and offline resources, and covering a larger market.Senior Vice President at Tencent Cloud International Poshu Yeung steers the company to be overseas business' choice of partner to connect with China.The key is customised solutionsTencent Cloud has been considered as one of the go-to cloud solutions for multinational corporations most keen to enter the China market. Importantly, the company refuses to offer \u2018one size fits all\u2019 cookie-cutter solutions. Instead, it works to provide precise customised solutions so its customers and partners can then be perfectly positioned to benefit from China\u2019s vast potential.This policy has guided the company well. Tencent Cloud\u2019s revenue from the international markets grew by 100 per cent, year-on-year in 2020, with overseas business growth being a one of the critical strategic areas.Today the company is represented in 27 geographic regions and 68 availability zones in major cities around the world. This is in addition to a content delivery network (CDN) of over 2,800 acceleration nodes across more than 70 countries and regions, offering a combined bandwidth of over 200Tbps. Generally speaking, the more acceleration nodes in a CDN, the faster and more reliable content access is concerned.While the company\u2019s recent CDN and related development is encouraging enough, being a relatively young player in cloud services means the undeniable challenge of not having the \u2018first-mover\u2019 advantage. Tencent Cloud addresses this issue with creativity. It builds a comprehensive cloud partner ecosystem in both newly emerging markets, and fully-developed countries. Thus making the strengthening of its partner network a priority.Not only does Tencent Cloud provide professional training conducted by seasoned industry practitioners to ensure channel partners are equipped with top-tier expertise; the company also provides go-to-market support to help generate leads for partners. These leads are supplemented by dedicated support from Tencent Cloud\u2019s channel managers, providing extra backing from the company\u2019s business consultants to win key opportunities.Yeung likes to use brick toys as an analogy. \u201c[As a customer] you tell me what you want, including the characteristics and style of a solution you want. Tencent Cloud will pick the perfect colour and size of blocks for you, and so design a solution created just for you.\u201d Yeung declares that the Tencent Cloud Team always studies the specific needs of their customers and partners.Tencent Cloud has developed to be one of the largest cloud service providers in China and the world only a few years after its inception in 2013.Continued researchCertainly Tencent\u2019s more than 20 years of technological innovation, its robust infrastructure foundation, and its extensive global CDN has worked to the company\u2019s advantage.To further the company\u2019s advantages, Tencent Cloud has been promoting the development of audio and video technology while continuing its research in cloud, virtual reality, and augmented reality technologies. All with the goal of finding breakthroughs whenever possible to maintain its position in cloud technology.Despite its relentless pursuit of technological breakthroughs, Tencent Cloud knows the significance of security in the space of international business.Tencent Cloud is supported by no less than seven security laboratories. Plus a fully integrated intelligent security management system, which prioritises cloud security research, operation, and platform protection. Meanwhile, in terms of security products, Tencent Cloud offers a range of techniques to ensure the stability and availability of customers\u2019 offerings.With its formless state in the cloud industry, Tencent Cloud manages to demonstrate a pattern for healthy growth: cutting-edge technology applications and comprehensive security solutions. Add to this a world-class network, and a friendly \u201cour customers come first\u201d service approach. The fact that Tencent Cloud can ride on its experience accumulated in Tencent in China has also proved its worth.",

            "description": "Few things sound more Intel than \u201cStarLake\u201d but in fact, AMD is at the heart of an announcement with Chinese hyperscale giant, Tencent.Tencent has already rolled out previous AMD Epyc based servers, including the SA1 (\u201cNaples\u201d) and more recently, SA2 based on AMD \u201cRome\u201d processors but making the jump to \u201cMilan\u201d based nodes for both internal and cloud use has proven advantageous. This is a big deal for AMD, of course, since Tencent operates China\u2019s largest collection of datacenters with over one million servers in its purview.According to Tencent, the company will be using AMD \u201cMilan\u201d CPUs for a self-styled new generation of servers for in-house and cloud applications. The new nodes will sport 232 cores and a 220 percent jump in performance for certain applications, including AI inference.According to Tencent\u2019s GM of Cloud Server Supply Chain, Liu Yuxun, the previous AMD systems have been wildly popular and the \u201cpreferred computing platform for e-commerce enterprises, supporting 90 percent of the computing power demand in that scenario.\u201d While some of this growth dropped off during the pandemic, Liu Yuxun explains, \u201csupporting Tencent\u2019s meeting capacity expansion of one mission cores in eight days and guaranteeing the meeting needs of tens of millions of users in 130 countries and regions around the world\u201d gave good use to any of that spare capacity.In 2020, Tencent opened its \u201cStarLake Lab\u201d to focus on creating a self-directed ecosystem around core infrastructure, with a good portion of work clearly focused on developing around AMD processors. This was with good cause, at Tencent\u2019s Global Digital Ecosystem event just before the world shut down, the company showcased the first round of AMD-based servers (\u201cRome\u201d) with self-styled cooling technology, which went on to meet 98 percent of all cloud application scenario demand.Tencent has been using its SA2 \u201cRome\u201d based servers for plenty of its own in-house applications as well and one can expect this will continue unhindered with the newest generation of \u201cMilan\u201d nodes. In 2020, Tencent\u2019s head of advertising technology announced they were using the SA2 servers for large-scale ad delivery across its vast network with a 25 percent reduction in compute time for ad delivery.\u201cIn the future, Tencent Cloud will continue to accelerate the deployment of self-developed server products in datacenters around the world to provide more cost-effective services to global customers,\u201d Tencent\u2019s supply chain GM adds.Tencent\u2019s StarLake servers are backed by 100Gbit/sec network bandwidth with a 400 percent increase in single-node network bandwidth compared to the previous generation and a 260 percent increase in network packet forwarding performance.The new system\u2019s storage hinges on Tencent\u2019s own CBS block storage engine, which it says makes the entire storage capacity reach 8GB/sec and cuts I/O latency by 63 percent, making the StarLake servers also ideal for HPC applications.Tencent adds that air-cooled heat dissipation capabilities are improved by 22 percent and the liquid-cooled variant can reduce carbon emissions by 8 percent.\u201cBy working hand in hand, we can provide users with the StarLake server with higher performance, reasonable price and lower power.\u201dSign up to our Newsletter Featuring highlights, analysis, and stories from the week directly from us to your inbox with nothing in between.Subscribe now",

            "description": "Longtime readers may know I think that Tencent (TCEHY -0.22%) is the best company in China, and the best positioned to weather the current regulatory crackdown.Yet I don't own any Tencent shares. That's because since I have a very long time horizon, I've decided to own Tencent through its largest shareholder Naspers (NPSNY 1.59%), as well as Naspers' spinoff, Prosus (PROSY).That's because both entities, which own a large stake in Tencent and other companies in emerging markets, began to trade at a discount to the value of their stakes in Tencent alone -- not to mention their other holdings in classifieds, food delivery, fintech, and education tech companies in developing markets.Despite management's best efforts, that discount has only widened, to the point where the valuation gap has become truly ridiculous. Just how ridiculous, you ask?Naspers, Prosus, and Tencent: a brief historyAs Tencent has grown in value over the years, Naspers began to trade at a large discount to its assets, which management attributed to its dominant size on the relatively small Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE).To attempt to fix the problem, in 2019 Naspers spun off its international investments into Prosus, a holding company on the larger European Euronext Exchange, with Naspers retaining a roughly 73% majority stake in Prosus. The thinking was the spinoff would lower Naspers outsized weight on the JSE, while Prosus would trade up to fair value on the larger and more liquid Euronext Exchange. The spinoff closed the gap for a short time, but the discount began to widen again, and Naspers began to trade at a discount to Prosus.In another move, this past summer, Prosus and Naspers engaged in a share swap, in which Prosus would essentially buy 49% of Naspers' \"cheaper\" stock with its own more \"expensive\" stock, in an effort to further boost Prosus' liquidity and further lower Naspers' weight on the JSE.It's a bit complicated, since Prosus was buying shares of the company that owns a stake in itself, but management has simplified things for investors. After the swap, Naspers is essentially entitled to 41.3% of Prosus' assets as of September 30, with Prosus shareholders entitled to the remaining 58.7%. Although since Prosus is currently repurchasing shares, Naspers' ownership percentage is likely slightly higher today.Truly massive discountsEven as Tencent has fallen this year, the discount has actually widened to a remarkable extent. Management calculates that as of September 30, Prosus' net asset value (NAV) was 131.20 Euros per share, compared with just a 70.68 Euro share price today \u2013 a 46% discount.But if you look at Naspers' entitlement to the companies' assets, its discount is truly mind-boggling. As of Sept. 30, Naspers' NAV per share was estimated at 6,326 ZAR per share, compared with just a 2,461 ZAR share price today, an incredible 62% discount.Buy Tencent's $20 billion annual cash flows for free via NaspersSure, Naspers and Prosus are cheap, but say you are worried about Tencent's future because of the Communist Party's slew of new regulations this year.No matter, because one way to think about Naspers' current price is that it's worth less than the value of its non-Tencent investments plus Tencent's own outside investments alone. Remember, Tencent is not only the leader in Chinese gaming, social media, streaming, fintech, and a strong second place in cloud computing, it's also an investor itself -- perhaps the best venture and growth company investor in the world.In its third quarter earnings release, Tencent disclosed its estimated value of its investment portfolio at $185 billion. Since Prosus owns about 28.9% of Tencent, its share of Tencent's investment portfolio comes to about $54.5 billion. Meanwhile, Prosus' stake in both private and publicly listed companies outside of Tencent was estimated at roughly $49 billion as of September 30.So when you think about it, Prosus essentially owns $103.5 billion in assets outside of Tencent's main business and subsidiaries. And remember, that was as of September 30. Given the bounce in several Chinese and technology stocks since then, that number is likely higher today.Still, using that figure and Naspers' 41.3% ownership of those assets, Naspers' share of Prosus' asset base comes to about $42.75 billion today. Yet Naspers' market cap after the share swap is just $33.4 billion as of this writing.That essentially means in buying Naspers, you are getting all of Tencent's investments and Prosus' non-Tencent investments at a discount \u2013 as well as Tencent's amazing core businesses for nothing.Last year, Tencent's core businesses earned over $19.2 billion in net income outside of its investments. Prosus' stake would amount to over $5.5 billion, and Naspers' look-through share would equate to about $2.3 billion. So another way to think about Naspers' valuation is that you are buying Tencent's core business for 14.5 times 2020 earnings, and then getting all Tencent's and Prosus' other investments for free.What will the future hold?Of course, it's entirely possible Naspers and Prosus will trade at such a discount for a long-time. The discount could even widen; after all, I really didn't think the discount would ever get this large to begin with.However, over the long run -- however long that is -- eventually, that intrinsic value will find its way to shareholders. That's why Naspers and Prosus looks like extremely compelling long-term investments in an otherwise expensive tech market today.",

Tencent is in my view the best-positioned internet company in the most attractive internet market in the world,\" he told reporters on a call.In August, Prosus set up a cross-holding structure with Naspers (NPNJn.J), under which Prosus shareholders own 60% of their underlying assets but Naspers retains control. They share a single board.In its separate earnings report, Naspers, South Africa's largest company by market capitalization, posted half-year revenue of $17.2 billion, up 29% from a year ago. read moreReporting by Toby Sterling and Promit Mukherjee; Editing by Kim Coghill, Muralikumar Anantharaman and Alexander SmithOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "description": "Global games giant Tencent has bought a minority stake in UK developer and publisher Playtonic.The sizeable investment will allow the studio to more than double its headcount, expand to three development teams and create more games, one of which will be a sequel to the 2017 3D platform game: Yooka-Laylee.In an interview with GamesIndustry.biz, managing director Gavin Price said that the firm may open offices in new areas, move to a new HQ, and is even eyeing potential acquisitions in an effort to increase the company headcount from 40 to 90 over the next two years.Playtonic boss Gavin PriceThe deal follows the company's ambitious plans around the Yooka-Laylee IP.\"We've always had a dialogue with Tencent,\" says Price. \"We got chatting to them about the future of 3D platforming and what we're doing next. I mentioned that Playtonic had this growth plan of being lots of people with lots of teams. They said don't do anything hasty, that they really liked these chats and wanted to discuss how Tencent could get involved.\"I was surprised, because I didn't expect them to be interested in Playtonic. It turned out that they had a department for genres, including a 3D platform department. So we had to formalise our future content plan a bit. And we wanted to have an aspiration goal as well, which was to make Yooka-Laylee an IP that could appear on a major fast food chain's kids meal box.\"They liked the studio and what we put out before, and they thought they could help us achieve those goals. And it just continued from there. Naturally, everyone wanted to do this, so we just threw it over to the solicitors and waited for them to tell me it was done.\"He continues: \"Tencent's been passionate about saying that it really is the money and their expertise whenever we want it. We explained what we wanted to do, and they said they don't want to derail any of that. And already, with the deal closing, we've been introduced to so many people. I remember reading on GamesIndustry.biz what Splash Damage said about being handed the cheat codes, and I am already getting a sense of that.\"Ultimately, this is about more games from us. We want to do more games more often\"\"With Tencent having a stake in quite a lot of companies, there are lots of opportunities to be meeting and finding out more about each other. There's a huge level of support there.\"But ultimately, this is about more games from us. We want to do more games more often.\"Tencent has its own marketing and PR resources, plus conferences and meet-ups with its various investments. But Playtonic says it's all optional.\"I guess I have a boss now for the first time in a while,\" Price says with a smile. \"I'm joking. Already, in the emails I've sent over, I've been asking 'we're looking at this or that, is that ok?' And the replies I've got have been: 'Why are you asking us?'\"Price says the plan is to have three development teams working on different projects. But it's not all about expanding the company's resources. Part of the investment will enable Playtonic to leave behind its 'start-up mentality', expand its HR operations and play a more active role in the wider games industry.\"The crux of it is scaling up our game development teams. Getting more hires, and being able to operate multiple teams concurrently,\" he says.\"We are looking to build a workforce that is a lot more shareable across projects. As you're aware, a lot of us used to work at a company called Rare. And [back in the day] they had multiple teams, but those teams may as well have not known each other existed. Whereas we are trying to build up a company where people can be on different projects throughout their lifecycle, get on the credits, it is great for their development, but ultimately we're able to react and smooth out any bumps in the road. We don't want to crunch people to death.\"Also, now, we can spend time nurturing through talent, which is something we've not had the time as a business before.\"We've very much had this start-up mentality for the past six years. We probably should have broken out of it sooner than we have. Now, we are going to be doing things like proper HR solutions, legal teams, operational teams, wellness and events teams... we can do all this quality-of-life stuff. We're going to have a better base of operations. We will move location to somewhere that is better looking than our current office. And we may be opening in new locations.\"Also, if it makes sense, we may have one or two acquisitions, as well. It's hard to scale-up fast, so maybe we can find a solution that doesn't involve two to three years of hiring processes, and we can be in a location that is a lot more talent rich. And that's potentially not just UK.\"Playtonic's Yooka-Laylee games have continued to sell stronglyIn terms of new locations, Price has already identified Leamington Spa as a potential new office, and says it is looking at other locations where there are 'big educational institutions'.The other area of the business the investment will support is the firm's new publishing division Playtonic Friends. As part of the announcement, Playtonic has recruited Danny Spiteri, formerly of Frontier, Merge Games Raw Fury and Team 17, as Head of Publishing. And Price says the Tencent investment allows the company to invest in bigger projects.\"[Playtonic Friends] is about finding quality. A really great team, a really great game, and someone where you can look at yourself in the mirror, and ask: 'are we adding value by helping these people, or are we being publishery and just doing it for a quick way of making money?' We still have the same core ethics running through our decision-making. But it opens up the type of partner we can work with. It's what we were doing, but enhanced.\"Price says Playtonic's dev team was already working on three projects even before the Tencent money appeared. And although 3D platforming is part of that, the firm isn't entirely focused on the genre.\"If we had decided to remain doing one thing at a time, with just one team, I guess we would be announcing something around about now. But as it is, we've had that one team divided into three. I could show off three different projects right now. It's natural that when you have one team split into thirds, it's going to take three-times as long before we're ready to show anything.\"We should have done this two years ago. We could have afforded to be bolder with our plans than we realised\"\"3D platforming is something we've always wanted to go back to. It's going to be one of the key genres we want to remain active in, across every generation. We're not going to do a Rare and do three 3D platformers at the same time: Donkey Kong 64, Banjo Tooie and Conker's Bad Fur Day. We're not going to have three teams making similar games.\"It's not just more games, either. Price says that Playtonic's output will 'tick all the boxes' when it comes to indie, AA and AAA. And that a big focus for them is developing the tools and pipelines that will allow them to make better games faster.Playtonic has always been a company that has dreamed big. From the moment it set-up with the initial Yooka-Laylee Kickstarter, the ambition was to create a studio that would be working on multiple projects and releasing games annually, akin to how Rare used to during the 1990s.The company isn't there yet. Following the launch of 2017's 3D platformer Yooka-Laylee came 2019's 2D game Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair. The Tencent money, Price says, will allow the business to achieve that vision. And he laments that the company may have been able to do this earlier.\"We did great with both of our games, but it has been that long-tail that surprised us,\" Price says. \"I've never met anyone who has been able to say that they know what you're going to make to the nearest \u00a310,000. And it's only in hindsight where we can say that this carried on a lot longer than we realised.\"We should have done this two years ago. Finding that period in a company's timeline, where it is comfortable from a cash-flow perspective where we can absorb all this downtime to work on this growth funding plan. It turns out we could have started it two years ago right on the back end of Impossible Lair. We could have afforded to be bolder with our plans than we realised. It's nice that we're not being risky as a company, but we were probably playing it a bit safe.\"But we're two years wiser and two years better. So let's kick this plan into gear. We're now even more prepared to do it.\"",

We want to do more games more often.\"This isn\u2019t the first time Tencent has invested in a video game studio, the tech giants also recently acquired a major stake in Don\u2019t Starve dev Klei Entertainment , as well as System Shock 3 developer OtherSide Entertainment , and Bayonetta and Astral Chain studio Platinum Games .",

            "description": "According to a 2019 report by Deloitte, about 80% of South Africans have a bank account but only 24% of them make more than three transactions monthly.Unlike other African countries, South Africa also has a functioning credit system with the prevalent use of credit cards. However, expensive value-added services like credit cards do not necessarily address the needs of underbanked people.Digital payments gateways, on the other hand, have a unique use case, particularly when they can help people use their basic bank accounts to make payments. Ozow is one such player. Coming off a year of exponential growth, it has raised a $48 million Series B to provide more alternative payment solutions to its millions of merchants and consumers.Chinese internet giant Tencent led the round, with other investors Endeavor Catalyst and Endeavor Harvest Fund participating.Founder and CEO Thomas Pays started Ozow in 2014 to drive financial inclusion through open banking. The company allows consumers to access their internet banking platform when they make transactions online.On a call with TechCrunch, Pays said that before Ozow, manual EFT processes were the popular options to carry out transactions online. At the time, most fintechs and banks did not recognize the need for using bank payments to facilitate online transactions.Pays launched Ozow to automate the manual EFT process consumers used to pay across e-commerce, point-of-sale, e-billing or P2P methods. According to Pays, he wanted Ozow to \u201cmake it seamless for consumers to pay in three clicks.\u201d\u201cWhen you looked at e-commerce, point of sale, e-billing or P2P payment seven years ago, it was always a fragmented market. For example, if I want a point of sale device, I need to go to a company like Yoco. If I want to accept payments via card on my e-commerce site, I need to go to a PayU,\u201d the CEO stated in an interview with TechCrunch.\u201cWhat we wanted to address was a central platform that could basically provide solutions to e-commerce, point of sale, e-billing and peer to peer payment.\u201dThe platform, which caters to more than 47 million bank account holders, typically works this way. First, consumers select Ozow as a payment option when shopping online or in-store.Next, they choose their bank (from all ten major South African banks), log in with their online banking details, and Ozow automates the payment process.All merchants need to have is a bank account and a \u201csmart-enabled device\u201d to receive payments. Ozow\u2019s clients include leading enterprise companies, such as MTN, Vodacom, Shoprite Group, Takealot and Uber.Ozow is free for individual users. Merchants can also use the payments gateway for free in the first 12 months, or up to $65,000 in processing value per month.The company also works with distributors and payment service providers and resellers of its product. They get charged a percentage fee that varies between 1.5-2.5% for every successful transaction made via Ozow.EFTs represented about 4% of the volume of sales in e-commerce stores in South Africa before Ozow came into the picture. Now that volume has grown to an average of about 30%, and EFTs have become South Africa\u2019s second most popular payment option (after cards) for e-commerce.Pays says Ozow is creating automated bank-to-bank payment solutions for over 47 million bank account holders and more than 100 industries in South Africa.Since the company\u2019s Series A raise of $2.5 million in 2019, Ozow has seen a 100% year-on-year growth of its business. It processes over $100 million in transaction volume per month across thousands of merchants.\u201cWe are also seeing a growth in new users, which is in excess of 140,000 per month. That\u2019s quite an incredible growth and adoption,\u201d he said.\u201cAnd this is certainly due to the consumer and merchant education that we had to go through over the past seven years as it was quite an innovative solution that no one was really familiar with before.\u201dFrom 2016 to 2017, Ozow raised a combined $1.2 million in angel and seed rounds, and up until now, its total raise stood at $3.7 million from backers such as Kalon Ventures. However, this Series B round has increased that number to $51.7 million.Pays is particularly excited about the company\u2019s new investors that made this happen. As lead investor, Tencent committed almost half of the total raised, about $20 million, Pays tells me.\u201cIt\u2019s an honour to bring on board Tencent, Endeavor Catalyst and Endeavor Harvest Fund. This is a validation of our role in transforming the banking industry through the development of innovative, convenient and more inclusive payment solutions for everyone,\u201d he said in a statement.On a side note, Reid Hoffman was also involved in the round as he chaired the Endeavor Catalyst\u2019s investment committee approval.Using the new funds, Ozow hopes to drive fintech regulation to ensure that more people access payment services.\u201cWe\u2019re working closely with the regulators to drive open banking, and that includes our collaboration with government and industry partners to rollout RPP,\u201d the company said in a statement.Though 8 out of 10 South Africans own a bank account, over 70% of all retail payment volumes and 89% of the country\u2019s transactions in its informal economy are still cash-based.Ozow\u2019s plan with the RPP (Rapid Payment Programme) is to create an instant payment ecosystem that would give people the ability to make real-time payments using simple identifiers, such as mobile numbers or email addresses.The CEO mentioned that Ozow also plans to expand its team from 100 to 250, including hiring employees in its new European office.A portion of the funds will also be directed at mergers and acquisitions and pan-African expansion to four countries in the next six months: Namibia, Ghana, Nigeria and Kenya.TechCrunch reported in this piece that African venture capital raised during the first half of 2021 was about twice the funds raised in H2 2020. Having raised more than $3 billion already, the continent is set to trounce historical records of venture capital raised this year.",

            "description": "It was way back in 2017 that the company that became Ultraleap (Ultrahaptics) demonstrated at TechCrunch Disrupt a technology that pioneered ultrasound to replicate the sense of touch. The impressive \u201cStar Wars\u201d demonstration took the crowd by storm.It was quite the demo (see the video below). The underlying technology was based on post-graduate research from inventor \u2014 and still CEO \u2014 Tom Carter. Ultrahaptics went on to raise $23 million, began to interest car companies and later absorbed the much-hyped Leap Motion, which, it turns out, was a match made in heaven, by uniting both hand tracking and mid-air haptics.Ultraleap has now raised an $82 million (\u00a360 million) Series D funding, led by a combination of Tencent, British Patient Capital\u2019s \u201cFuture Fund: Breakthrough\u201d and CMB International. Also participating were existing shareholders Mayfair Equity Partners and IP Group plc.Commenting, Tom Carter, Ultraleap CEO, said recent chatter about the VR-based \u201cMetaverse\u201d from companies like Facebook, as well as the shift to touchless interfaces brought about by the pandemic, helped its fundraising.\u201cThe metaverse concept is not new to Ultraleap,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has always been our mission to remove boundaries between physical and digital worlds. The pandemic has accelerated the rise of the term as more people now understand the power of enhancing the physical world with digital elements. For Ultraleap, this new era is not constrained to VR headsets. Like the internet, it is a reality we will interact with, in all parts of life: at home, in the office, in cars, or out in public. Our aim with this Series D raise is to accelerate the transition to the primary interface \u2014 your hands \u2014 because there are no physical controllers, buttons or touchscreens in anyone\u2019s vision of the metaverse.\u201dUltraleap\u2019s fifth-generation hand-tracking platform, dubbed Gemini, is clearly heading toward a number of devices. It\u2019s already built into multiple platforms, camera systems and third-party hardware, including Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon XR2 chipset and Varjo\u2019s VR-3 and XR-3 headsets.Ultraleap\u2019s plan is to take Gemini to different operating systems, increase investment in tooling / R&D and let developers run away with their imaginations on how to apply the technology.One of the key drivers of this touchless technology is, of course, The Great Pandemic. Like, who wants to touch anything anymore, right?!Thus, companies like PepsiCo and Lego are already using Ultraleap\u2019s technology in public interfaces.And as was hinted at back in 2017, automakers are looking to make the \u201cin-cabin experience\u201d a real thing. So Ultraleap is already working with DS Automobiles and Hosiden on new mid-air haptics experiences.Carter expanded on these moves on a call, explaining that the potential for user interfaces that work inside VR-based metaverses are the vision for Ultraleap\u2019s technology: \u201cAdmittedly, the metaverse is a very buzzy thing at the moment, but it really does describe the thing that we\u2019ve been working towards: removing the barriers between humans and virtual content.\u201cWe\u2019ve raised this round to help transition everyone towards that optimum interface of your hands, across all of the markets that we target. So on XR, we\u2019ve launched Gemini, and in the last few weeks, a new generation of hand tracking, which is getting super rave reviews. It\u2019s really now time to scale out-of-home. Pepsi\u2019s deployment had 85% user preference and parity with touchscreens in terms of completion times for putting your orders through.\u201dThen there\u2019s automotive. He said: \u201cUX is the new horsepower. We\u2019re still driving, but we are moving towards being much more focused on the experience within the cabin\u2026 whether you\u2019re working, working, being entertained, or other sorts of similarly Metaverse-like activities within your car.\u201dHe said it turns out that there\u2019s a very big safety benefit in using these mid-air interfaces over trying to use a touchscreen, where you have to take your eyes off the road: \u201cIt reduces the mental load on the driver by about 20%, by reducing the number of glances off the road that the driver takes. Transitioning to that interface makes the driving experience safer. And then once you have that interface and people are used to interacting in this way, it makes the transition to the future world easier.\u201dHere\u2019s the 2017 demonstration:",

            "description": "Profits at Tencent Music Entertainment, China\u2019s largest digital music company, dropped in the third quarter of its financial year as the company felt the impact of the Chinese government\u2019s multiple crackdowns on the tech sector.Net profits in the three months from July to September 2021 fell to RMB788 million ($122 million). That compares with net profit of RMB1.13 billion in the equivalent quarter last year, and with an RMB871 figure in the April-June second quarter of 2020.Revenues at RMB7.81 billion ($1.21 billion), were up 3% year-on-year, but down 2% quarter-on-quarter.The company\u2019s operations include online music, online audio, online karaoke, music-centric live streaming and online concert services. It operates under brand names including QQ Music, Kugou Music, Kuwo Music and WeSing.The company said that it managed to increase the number of paying users by 37% year on year to 71.2 million and that it had increased the proportion of users that take subscriptions. But monthly active user numbers (MAU), a key metric for tech companies, dropped in both its music and social entertainment segments.The company explained its turbulent performance by pointing to the impact of regulation and increased competition. But it did not quantify either. And, in practice, it may be difficult to separate the two effects, given that one thrust of the regulators has been to loosen Tencent Music\u2019s dominance and to strengthen industry competitors.\u201cRevenues from social entertainment services and others in the third quarter of 2021 decreased by 6.4% to RMB4.92 billion ($763 million) from RMB5.25 billion in the same period of 2020. The decrease was mainly due to the impact from new regulations as well as increased competition from other pan-entertainment platforms, despite a strong revenue growth in audio live streaming,\u201d the company said.China\u2019s crackdowns have curbed collection and usage of user data, mergers and acquisitions, overseas share listings (Tencent Music is listed on the New York Stock Exchange) and game addiction among young users.In the music sector, regulators in July ordered Tencent Music to unwind its exclusive content deals with major music labels and to loosen the terms and conditions of its local supply deals with other Chinese platforms.The State Administration for Market Regulation gave the company just 30 days to comply. The company\u2019s general and administrative expenses in the third quarter may give an indication of the compliance costs. Expenses soared by 33 to RMB1.05 billion ($163 million) though the company pointed instead to increased investment in R&D and various post-acquisition costs.For the future, CEO Ross Liang, plans to \u201ccontinue to embrace and collaborate with the broader Tencent ecosystem through multiple cross-platform partnerships with Weixin, Tencent Games and Tencent Video.\u201dParent company, Tencent is scheduled to release its quarterly figures on Wednesday.Subscribe to Variety Newsletters and Email Alerts!",

We are proactively embracing the new regulatory environment which we believe should contribute to a more sustainable development path for the industry.\"In the domestic games market, our industry-leading efforts in fully complying with new regulations significantly reduced minors' game time and spending, fostering a healthier gameplay environment.\"In September, Tencent and Netease were summoned by Chinese regulators as the country reportedly slowed down online game approvals.",

            "description": "SHANGHAI \u2014 Apple Music and Tencent Music Entertainment (TME) have reached an agreement that will allow hundreds of thousands of Chinese musicians to stream their music globally on Apple\u2019s platform, while giving Apple a way to scrape its way into China\u2019s booming domestic music market.Music from record labels and artists that are part of Tencent\u2019s TME Cloud Music will become available on Apple Music, Tencent said in a statement on Tuesday (Nov. 9).The companies framed the move as a way for artists to \u201cenable music lovers to explore China\u2019s unique music culture and genres\u201d while \u201cassisting in the international development of Chinese musicians.\u201d (The companies did not release financial details about the partnership or when it will begin.)The partnership is a breakthrough for Apple Music, which first entered the Chinese market back in 2015, but has made little impact in the country so far. Tencent controls 77% of the Chinese streaming market through its QQ Music, Kuguo and Kuwo platforms.While Apple has a large roster of international artists, it has struggled to reach new audiences because of its relatively small library of Chinese repertoire \u2013 especially compared to TME and Netease Cloud Music, Chinese music analysts have said.TME has repeatedly stressed the importance of its growing bank of original music from independent Chinese musicians and labels. Aside from its streaming platforms, Tencent created TME Original Productions, which develops hit TV shows like Produce 101, a spin-off of the Korean variety show, which attracts billions of views every year. And TME runs Tencent Music Program, a service for aspiring musicians to upload their own music to its platforms, while also opening up access to copyright development and professional training.Related China Regulator Orders Tencent Music to End Exclusive Licensing Deals With LabelsAlso yesterday, TME released its earnings for the third quarter, showing mixed results for the music company. While paying users on Tencent Music rose by 37.7% to 71.1 million, exhibiting the growing willingness of Chinese music fans to pay for music, the company\u2019s quarterly revenues rose by just 3% year-on-year.The partnership could also give a boost to Chinese musicians hoping to increase their exposure abroad. In the past year, the Chinese government put online music company Bandcamp behind the Chinese internet firewall and the platform now requires Chinese users to have a VPN, essentially creating another roadblock for Chinese musicians attempting to reach global audiences. Other music sites like Spotify, YouTube and SoundCloud also require the use of a VPN.Despite its initial struggles in China, Apple\u2019s smartphone penetration is growing, and Apple Music has sought to undercut its Chinese rivals to gain a foothold. Apple controlled 14% of the Chinese smartphone market in the second quarter of this year, up from 8% in the second quarter of 2020, according to research firm Counterpoint. A monthly subscription for Apple Music costs 10 RMB ($1.56), with Netease charging 18 RMB ($2.82) and Tencent Music\u2019s asking 20 RMB ($3.13).It has been a difficult year for TME. China\u2019s State Administration of Market Regulation (SAMR) fined the company a total of 2.5 million yuan ($385,000) for five breaches of regulatory requirements after investigations into its exclusivity deals with record labels like Universal, Sony and Warner. TME has since given up those exclusivity deals.Despite the government crackdown, the company is setting its sights on improving social entertainment content, which includes karaoke app WeSing, while continuing to develop TME Live functions and long-form audio content.In the third-quarter earnings call, Ross Liang, CEO of TME, said that monthly average users of long-form audio had grown 89% year-over-year to more than 140 million, \u201cas our users discover the complementary experience of music and audio streaming.\u201d",

            "description": "Beijing-based Dalian Wanda Group filed papers Thursday to bring its commercial property business back to the Hong Kong stock market, as the developer controlled by billionaire Wang Jianlin looks to end five years marooned as a private firm after an ill-fated exit from the HKEX in 2016 in hopes of listing on a mainland Chinese exchange.The cornerstone investors in the unit, now dubbed Zhuhai Wanda Commercial Management Group, include Hong Kong private equity shop PAG, developer Country Garden, investment firm CITIC Capital and tech giants Tencent and Ant, according to a draft application filed with the HKEX.Wanda Commercial operates 380 Wanda Plaza malls in mainland China \u2014 including 280 owned by the parent group and 100 more held by independent third parties \u2014 with gross floor area under management of 54.2 million square metres (583.4 million square feet) and 162 projects in the pipeline.\u201cSince we commenced managing Wanda Plazas in 2002, we have accumulated extensive operational experience and unique industry insights, established mature operation and tenant sourcing systems, and equipped ourselves with strong technology and data analysis capabilities,\u201d Wanda Commercial said, adding that the company began managing malls owned by third parties in 2015 as it began attempts at transitioning from operating as a developer to becoming a fund manager.Second Time AroundIf an IPO eventuates, it will be mark the return of Wanda\u2019s mall business to the Hong Kong exchange after Wang led a $4.4 billion buyout of the firm in September 2016. The company announced in March that it was giving up its nearly six-year quest to list on a mainland stock exchange.Wanda Commercial recorded a 2020 net profit of RMB 1.1 billion ($172 million), which was down 8.8 percent year-on-year. Revenues, however, rose 28.4 percent to RMB 17.2 billion in the same period, the company said in the draft application. For the first six months of 2021 it reported a net profit of RMB 655.5 million, down 19.8 percent year-on-year, on revenue of RMB 6.1 billion, up 27.1 percent.The document was silent on how much money the company aims to raise with the prospective listing. The South China Morning Post, citing media reports, said Wanda Commercial is targeting up to $4 billion from the offering.Reuters reported last month that the parent group had raised nearly $6 billion for Wanda Commercial ahead of the IPO, including $2.8 billion from PAG and the rest from the likes of Country Garden, CITIC Capital, Tencent and Ant.Wanda Commercial, which will manage but not own Wanda\u2019s retail properties, earns its revenue by collecting a slice \u2014 typically from 20 to 40 percent \u2014 of the net operating income generated from projects under its management, according to the draft application.Friends in ZhuhaiIn March, Wanda Commercial announced that it had signed an agreement under which the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, an entity controlled by the government of the southern city of Zhuhai, would invest RMB 3 billion in a firm spun out from the developer.The terms of the deal stipulated that Wanda Commercial must reorganise its non-development activities under the name of Wanda Light Assets Commercial Management, to be incorporated in Zhuhai with Wanda Commercial as the parent firm. A Wanda insider told Chinese website Sohu.com that the purpose of the restructuring was to prepare the company to go public.A listing would help Wanda fulfil a pledge made to four strategic investors more than three years ago.In January 2018, Tencent\u2019s QQ Music division, Suning.com, JD.com and developer Sunac China Holdings agreed to invest about RMB 34 billion to acquire a 14 percent stake in Wanda Commercial. The deal between Wanda and the four investors required Wanda Commercial to complete a listing before 31 October 2023, though the terms did not specify a listing location.Building Back LighterAlthough keen to play down the developer tag and reposition itself as an investment manager, Wanda Commercial remained China\u2019s top developer by operating income last year with RMB 35.5 billion ($5.4 billion), a full RMB 21 billion ahead of nearest rival Red Star Macalline, according to data provider CRIC.But the conglomerate helmed by Wang, once Asia\u2019s richest man, is a far cry from its heyday in the middle years of the last decade, when the group built a $5 billion overseas real estate portfolio. Since that peak, Wanda has liquidated its assets worldwide as mainland authorities targeted major cross-border investors as part of a crackdown on outbound capital flows.In March, the group disclosed that it had ceded majority control of AMC Theatres, the world\u2019s biggest cinema chain, which it had purchased outright for $2.6 billion in 2012 \u2014 the retreat serving as a potent symbol of Wanda\u2019s faded global ambitions.",

            "description": "The National Basketball Association and Nike (NKE) have been silent publicly since Boston Celtics center Enes Kanter called out China over human rights abuses.Last week Kanter posted a series of videos on Twitter where he called Chinese President Xi Jinping a \u201cbrutal dictator,\u201d and asked the Chinese government to free Tibet and close down \u201cthe slave labor camps and free the Uyghur people.\u201d Kanter also took his messages onto the court via custom sneakers designed by Chinese activist-artist Badiucao.On Monday, Kanter was back on Twitter, this time accusing Nike for producing sneakers in labor camps. The next day, he invited Nike\u2019s president Phil Knight and NBA legends Michael Jordan and Lebron James to visit the factories.While the NBA and Nike did not comment immediately, and did not respond to Sportico\u2019s requests for comment, Kanter\u2019s statements resulted in Chinese video streaming platform Tencent cutting the live broadcast of the Celtics\u2019 games last week. Tencent signed a five-year, $1.5 billion deal to remain the NBA\u2019s digital partner in China in 2019. The state controlled station CCTV has been the sole broadcaster of the NBA games since 1990s.Relations between the NBA and China have been tense since 2019, when former Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted in support of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. Following those tweets, the Chinese government stopped the broadcast of NBA games in China. The league eventually returned to Tencent except for Philadelphia\u2019s games (where Morey moved after the 2019 season). CCTV, meanwhile, blocked the league except for two games during the 2020 NBA finals. Last year, the league lost an estimated $200 million in revenue from China.The world\u2019s most populous nation is an important market for the NBA with approximately 500 million fans. The basketball league also owns a $5 billion enterprise called NBA China that develops local players. However, according to an ESPN investigation, serious human rights abuses were reported in these training facilities even before Morey\u2019s tweets. American coaches at three NBA training academies complained to NBA officials, claiming their Chinese colleagues abused young players. One of those training centers was in Xinjiang, where most of the players who trained were Uighurs.\u201cThe best way to make people care to change this indifference situation is to make people view those messages and make campaigns relevant,\u201d said Badiucao, who has been criticizing China for the last two decades and supports Kanter\u2019s move to expand his message beyond Turkey. Born in Switzerland to Turkish parents, Kanter has been a vocal critic of Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Kanter is a devout member of the Hizmet Movement and a follower of its leader, Fethullah Gulen, accused of the failed coup attempt in 2016. The Turkish government revoked Kanter\u2019s Turkish passport in 2017.\u201cWhen you\u2019re not coming from the country that is suffering from authoritarian regimes, like China, it\u2019s hard for you to care or understand truly,\u201d Badiucao said. Using the \u201cNBA as a platform, or sports to convey these human rights messages, is just magical. Because now suddenly, it is a topic for every NBA fan in America and around the world.\u201d",

The game that was not shown on the streaming services that typically broadcast most NBA games to millions in China.No comment from NBAThe NBA had no immediate comment, and the Celtics were not practicing Thursday. It was also not immediately clear how long Tencent's plans to not air the Celtics would last.Kanter was wearing shoes emblazoned with the words \"Free Tibet\" during Wednesday night's game. \"More than 150 Tibetan people have burned themselves alive!! \u2014 hoping that such an act would raise more awareness about Tibet. I stand with my Tibetan brothers and sisters, and I support their calls for Freedom,\" he wrote on Twitter.The league and China have had a damaged relationship since October 2019, when then-Houston general manager Daryl Morey tweeted in support of government protesters in Hong Kong and sparked what essentially became a blackout for the league in the world's most populous nation.Sixers blacked-out last seasonNBA games were eventually returned to Tencent's lineup but not state television provider CCTV, except for two games during the 2020 NBA Finals. Tencent did not offer Philadelphia's games last season, Morey's first with the 76ers.\"The player you mentioned was clout-chasing, trying to get attention with Tibet-related issues,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Thursday when asked about Kanter's posts. \"His wrong remarks are not worth refuting.\"China's Communist leaders are extremely sensitive to anything they view as outside interference in domestic political affairs. After Morey's tweet, the fallout was immense, and sponsors \u2014 following CCTV's lead \u2014 pulled their backing of the NBA China Games days later between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets. The NBA estimated that the strained relationship with the Chinese and lost broadcast rights meant the league missed out on about $400 million in revenue during the 2019-20 season alone.\"It's unclear whether we'll be back on CCTV television in China this year,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said earlier this week.Comments vs. tweetFor now, the fallout from Kanter's comments does not appear to be as severe as the immediate response to Morey's tweet, which was quickly deleted.

Kanter has said his passport was revoked by the Turkish government in 2017.It's not just the NBA that is finding itself dealing with difficult issues when it comes to relationships with China. A number of groups have called for the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, and others, to boycott this winter's Beijing Games in support of human-rights issues.The USOPC plans to send full teams to China for the February Olympics.\"We expect that China is going to be a unique situation to really allow sport to speak for unity and for global peace and for the rights of people around the world,\" said Susanne Lyons, who chairs the USOPC board of directors. \"That really is the place where sport can make its stand.\"",

For them, the internet\u2019s offerings are very limited as there aren\u2019t many services that have been built to serve such users \u2014 and many don\u2019t have any offering for such large masses at all.Lokal is attempting to reach these users and provide them with a broad range of services. Its eponymous hyperlocal social media app enables non-English speaking users to connect and interact with one another.The app also helps users find jobs in their vicinity and keeps them up to date with things such as commodity prices, real estate prices and matrimonial ads that you would otherwise find in local newspapers. Its offerings also include upskilling services.The startup says on its website that it has amassed over 10 million downloads and is popular in several states in South India.The new investment comes more than a year and a half after New Delhi introduced rules to require that Indian firms take its approval before raising capital from a Chinese investor. The move significantly slowed down Chinese firms\u2019 investment pace in India. But in recent months, several firms have raised from Tencent.TechCrunch reported in August that India\u2019s Pocket FM was in advanced talks to raise a round from Tencent and others. The Chinese giant, which has invested over $2 billion in Indian startups since 2016, also invested over $200 million in Indian social media platform ShareChat earlier this year, though the startup didn\u2019t disclose Tencent\u2019s involvement at the time of announcement.The firm, which also poured in more money in Indian music streaming service Gaana, has made several recent investments in Indian firms as convertible debts to buy the parties time for approval and give Tencent the option to convert its debt into an equity investment in future.",

            "description": "It's been more than a year since we learned Tencent had hired Halo 4 lead designer Scott Warner to lead a new Los Angeles-based office under its TiMi Studios business. And just a few months ago, TiMi announced it had also opened a Seattle studio to make AAA console games.Now we know they are one and the same thing. And that thing is Team Kaiju.'Kaiju' means 'strange beast' and that's what the studio hopes to be in the AAA space, creating games that shake up what is already a highly competitive genre: multiplayer first-person shooters. The team is currently working on a new IP for a live service game, and while details beyond that are scarce, Warner adds that: \"Gaming has yet to address all the player fantasies we could enjoy in an FPS game.\"That's probably true, but a little hard to fathom; there are military shooters covering every real-world conflict that comes to mind (as well as scores of fictional ones), open-world shooters set in far flung locations around the world, Wild West shooters, spy shooters, army shooters, sci-fi shooters, cartoon shooters, puzzle shooters -- heck, Far Cry Primal essentially turned the end of Upper Paleolithic Age into a shooter. What else can be left?Scott Warner, Team Kaiju\"I think there are always things left to do,\" Warner tells GamesIndustry.biz. \"In my personal opinion, video games are the preeminent creative medium of the 21st century. We're in the 'silent film' era, as far as I'm concerned, in terms of all the different interactions, fantasies and everything we can realise.So on the one hand, we can look at it and go, 'Haven't we already gone through all the well-trodden areas of fantasies that are popular in culture right now?' But then, just off the top of my head, where's your 'be an astronaut' FPS? Or Gearbox is doing their Borderlands and fantasy thing they're going to do. And what we're talking about is not even those things.\"The way we're looking at it is if you go through all our other mediums -- film, television, comics, music, books -- there are plenty of ideas that have yet to be realised in an interactive form that haven't happened for risk aversion reasons, technical capacity, and so on. Whatever the reason, there are so many other things to explore.\"Think about battle royale -- not even just the fantasy, but in terms of the modal exploration -- that's something we think about. When you're making multiplayer, you always think about modes, like domination, capture the flag, warzone, whatever. That wouldn't have seemed like something that was going to move the needle when you just say it out loud but it completely changed how players understood first-person shooters, multiplayer and their expectations in terms of mode.\"So there's a lot [of potential] but it requires more work and effort from us these days to try and come up with ideas that are going to address that thing when you look out there and think, 'Well, what else could there be?'\"Fortunately, much of the team has plenty of experience in creating AAA shooters. Warner himself, in addition to leading work on Halo 4, has worked on the Battlefield and Mercenaries series, while Team Kaiju's director of operations Rosi Zagorcheva was senior director of product development on Battlefield 4 and its many expansions, with additional experience on Star Wars Battlefront and Medal of Honor.\"The important thing for us is to make a welcoming game. We're confident we have a fantasy which is really appealing\" Rosi Zagorcheva, Team Kaiju\"We'll take all the experience the team has learned from making AAA shooters in the last decade and apply that to all the expectations that players are going to have when they learn the primary verb for [our game] is shooting,\" says Warner.\"Players expect the gun to feel a certain way, that they're able to acquire and aim at targets, that guns sound and feel a certain way, that they're an extension of the players themselves.... There are just so many things that have to happen under the hood to make the experience feel sort of baseline, cost of entry good for a person to enjoy a first-person shooter so that's where a lot of our experience will come into play.\"Even with extensive experience and a deep understanding of the genre, breaking into the highly competitive AAA space is no easy task. We've seen attempts in recent years, from V1 Interactive's ill-fated Disintegration (also made by former Halo devs) to the struggles of Cliff Blezsinski's LawBreakers. Warner acknowledges this, although counters with the rise of Overwatch, Valorant, Fortnite, PUBG, Escape From Tarkov, and Ark: Survival Evolved.\"There's plenty of new things that have reached millions of people,\" he says. \"Some of them are novel and new ideas, some of them are evolutions of form, and some are just trying to service a customer base. Like, is there something the Counter-Strike audience really wants but isn't getting from their current experience? Can you make some changes to that and find something new they'd be interested in?\"Team Kaiju has stated that, like almost any title in development these days, it will built around \"a community of players who will be encouraged to give feedback as a positive tool to improve the game.\" But when it comes to the shooter genre, perhaps more so than others, this comes with risks: competitive multiplayer shooters have been known to attract the more toxic elements of the gaming community. How do you design something built around a community without enabling those players to mistreat others?The team will draw on its experience with series like Halo and Battlefield to create a shooter that meets player expectations, while still introducing new ideasWarner says there are different ways to either minimise the degree of toxicity, or eliminate it completely: \"You can go from 'We're completely open, we don't care, toxicity is just an accepted part of the type of game we make' or you can go all the way on the other side of things. It's a strange example, but Journey removes it all. You're interacting with someone but you have a limited possibility space in which to do so, [that's] quite a bit different to something like Call of Duty. Or you go somewhere towards the middle; Overwatch is pretty innovative in changing the perspective of players from a very brutal way of evaluating their performance -- who got the most kills? -- to here is how you performed against yourself, and here's what made you feel like you were having a great game. Having a game that's entirely about performance around a team and understanding how you fit within that team.\"Rosi Zagorcheva, Team KaijuZagorcheva adds: \"The important thing for us is to make a welcoming game. We're confident we have a fantasy which is really appealing. We're leaning into understanding the people, our audience. The things our players are interested in, a version of this fantasy within the context of a first-person shooter, what motivates them, what accomplishments or actions or things to do in a game drive them, and finding an interest overlap between the different motivations of players that can take us to a really broad place. For us to do that, it has to be a welcoming game and appealing to the people that may not be in that initial group.\"While Team Kaiju will be based across Seattle and Los Angeles, the team is currently fully remote and will remain a hybrid when people eventually return to offices. Zagorcheva says this has been an advantage in attracting talent, and ensuring the studio is up to speed -- even before there is a physical studio.\"We believe we can be creative, and we've been able to do this for many months now,\" she says. \"We can make a game, that's shaping up to be really fun so far, remotely. This distributed way of working is a way for us to actually get people to join the studio that may not have chosen to do that had they needed to go to Seattle or LA. We get great talent from all over the world.\"What we have to do is work out how we do this well when we get a chance to go back to the office, when we have people in the office and some in their homes or somewhere else. There's a lot of thought around our culture, our norms for how we work together. [For us,] there is no difference between a person sitting in the office and a person sitting in their bedroom, so that those people don't feel any different in their opportunity to contribute and collaborate and make a good game. We're going to figure out things and learn. I think a lot of the games and tech industries are going through the same period of figuring out how to create things together when we're not in the same place. I believe this is the way of the future and we're going to get better at doing this in intentionally flexible ways that enable us to get the most out of a creative team.\"At present, the team stands at around 20 developers. Naturally, aiming for the AAA market means the studio will need to grow but Zagorcheva says they \"don't want to grow too big.\" She refers to the Dunbar Number -- the maximum point at which people can maintain social and collaborative relationships, believed to be around 100 to 250 and often cited as 150.\"If you go through all other mediums - film, television, comics, music, books - there are plenty of ideas that have yet to be realised in an interactive form\" Scott Warner, Team Kaiju\"We're fortunate to have the backing of TiMi, that gives us a lot of opportunities to do things in slightly different ways compared to what we're used to in the past,\" she says on scaling the studio.This includes building a more diverse team. While Team Kaiju is currently lacking in that regard -- around 75% of staff are your typical white, male developers -- Zagorcheva says she and her team are committed to bringing in as many perspectives as possible.\"It's something I think about all the time. It's not only the morally, ethically right thing to do, there's also a business imperative if we're going after diverse audiences across the world,\" she says.\"The work we've really invested in so far has been making sure the studio we're building is actually an inclusive environment for any type of person. That comes down to psychological safety, that's something that's really important to us. It's important to create a space where we can all be our authentic selves, we can be who we are. We can share ideas and collaborate in new ways that aren't [affected] by the potential embarrassment of saying something inadequate or looking bad. That creates a space for differences to be welcomed.\"Warner adds: \"If our goal as a studio is originality, what better way to do that than to find different voices to contribute creatively to everything we're doing. My No.1 creative interest is to try and do things differently, make things differently, have something to present to people that represents different points of view. The best way to do that is to have different people contributing to [your work].\"Team Kaiju is not just aiming to bring something new to the shooter space, it has also been built to bring something new to the console and PC space in general -- namely, its Tencent-owned parent TiMi Studios. The company's output has been primarily mobile to date, with the exception of the Switch version of Pok\u00e9mon Unite, so branching into AAA on more traditional platforms is a huge step.\"The strategy here is to associate TiMi with quality, and to get people in North America to look at TiMi as a division that can bring them experiences like the ones they know, like the quality of a Blizzard or an EA,\" Warner explains.\"The best way to do that is to make games that people care about, that they're going to talk about in communities, that are novel things they've never experienced before.\"",

Alibaba rose the most after Daily Journal Corp, chaired by Charlie Munger, boosted its Alibaba holdings by 83% during the third quarter.Most emerging market currencies recovered from last week's losses, but remained under pressure from surging oil prices and energy shortages, which could feed into inflation and keep economic growth slow - a phenomenon referred to as \"stagflation\".\"Higher energy prices/shortages will inevitably make their way through global value chains in the form of rising prices and potentially shortages of industrial and consumer goods,\" Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA wrote in a note.Turkey's lira rose 0.4% from record lows, after data showed the country's current account unexpectedly swung to a surplus in August.But the import-reliant economy is expected to remain under pressure this from supply chain disruptions, a falling exchange rate and rising energy costs.Russia's rouble rose 0.2%, benefiting from stronger crude prices, while Russian stocks touched record highs.The rouble was among the few EM currencies to gain last week, as a lower-than-expected government forex buying program also lent support.In central Europe, the Czech crown rose 0.1% to the euro, slightly more than its regional peers as September inflation came in above expectations, pointing towards more interest rate support from the central bank.Focus was also on the parliamentary election, with two main Czech opposition groups securing a majority and the chance to form a government.Rising inflation expectations across emerging markets have spurred several central banks into hiking rates. But a sustained rise in commodity prices may limit their effectiveness.Polish stocks rose 0.6%, while the zloty was flat as assets in the country appeared to be unperturbed by concerns that Poland could possibly leave the European union.For GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance in 2021, see tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance in 2021, see tmsnrt.rs/2OusNdXFor TOP NEWS across emerging marketsFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, seeFor TURKISH market report, seeFor RUSSIAN market report, seeReporting by Ambar Warrick; Editing by Toby ChopraOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "description": "LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Universal Hydrogen Co., the company leading the fight to decarbonize aviation through the adoption of hydrogen as a universal fuel, today announced a funding round yielding $62 million in new capital. New investors in the round include Mitsubishi HC Capital, Tencent, Stratos, GE Aviation, Waltzing Matilda Aviation, Fourth Realm, Hawktail, Marc Benioff\u2019s TIME Ventures, Jeff Wilke, and Spencer Rascoff\u2019s 75 and Sunny Ventures. The company\u2019s prior financing round in April 2021 included Playground Global, Fortescue Future Industries, Coatue, Global Founders Capital, Plug Power, Airbus Ventures, JetBlue Technology Ventures, Toyota Ventures, Sojitz, Future Shape, and Trucks, most of whom also participated in the current round. This brings Universal Hydrogen\u2019s total capital raised to date to $85 million.When every day counts in the fight against catastrophic climate change, this funding will enable Universal Hydrogen to conduct the first test flight of its hydrogen fuel cell powertrain on a 40+ passenger regional airliner in 2022 at Moses Lake, Washington. The green hydrogen for the flight will be supplied using Universal Hydrogen\u2019s modular fuel capsules that enable the delivery of hydrogen from the point of production directly to the aircraft using the existing freight network and airport cargo handling equipment\u2014without the need for any new infrastructure. The proprietary modular capsule technology is significantly lighter than the current state of the art in hydrogen storage and is designed from first principles for flight and ground transport safety certification.The company anticipates entry into commercial service in 2025 with a certified retrofit conversion kit for existing ATR 72 and De Havilland Canada Dash-8 regional airliners and a green hydrogen fuel services offering. Together, these will provide regional operators with unit economics that are equivalent or better than those of conventional jet fuel-powered variants of the aircraft. Universal Hydrogen has secured a substantial commercial order pipeline, including previously-announced LOIs from Icelandair, Air Nostrum, Ravn Alaska, and ASL Aviation Holdings.\u201cUniversal Hydrogen has attracted an incredible investor syndicate, representing key strategic and financial partners across Europe, the United States, Asia, and Australia,\u201d said Peter Barrett, General Partner at Playground Global and a member of Universal Hydrogen\u2019s Board of Directors. \u201cThis is a testament to the company\u2019s pragmatic approach to the monumental\u2014even existential\u2014challenge of our generation and the world-class team that Universal Hydrogen has catalyzed around it.\u201d\u201cWhile regional aviation represents a sizable market opportunity and an important early proof point in the fight against climate change, it is a small fraction of total aviation emissions,\u201d said Paul Eremenko, co-founder and CEO of Universal Hydrogen. \u201cIf we want to decarbonize the industry on the timeframe of the Paris Agreement, the world\u2019s narrowbody airliner fleet has to become hydrogen-powered starting in the 2030s. There is no known alternative technology to get there.\u201d To that end, the company is committed to collaborating with all key stakeholders, including airlines, lessors, airplane- and engine-makers to ensure that the next generation of narrowbody aircraft (succeeding the 737 and A320 families) are true zero emissions vehicles.\u201cThe gravity of climate change is forcing a tipping point in the green hydrogen ecosystem of producers, distributors, and consumers,\" said Jim Adler, founding Managing Director of Toyota Ventures. \"Universal Hydrogen has the breakthrough technology, talented team, and operational urgency to emerge as the distribution leader in this hydrogen ecosystem. As early investors, we are proud to continue to support their efforts in any way we can.\u201dHeadquartered in Los Angeles, California, with an engineering center in Toulouse, France, and a flight test center in Moses Lake, Washington, Universal Hydrogen is rapidly growing its team in pursuit of its ambitious, world-changing goal.

The company takes a flexible, scalable, and capital-light approach to hydrogen logistics by transporting it in modular capsules over the existing freight network from green production sites to airports around the world. To accelerate market adoption, Universal Hydrogen is also developing a conversion kit to retrofit existing regional airplanes with a hydrogen-electric powertrain compatible with its modular capsule technology.",

            "description": "QuickPass users now can make payments by scanning WeChat Pay QR codes offline, and WeChat Pay users can do the same with QuickPass codes.In China, people can just tap their smartphones to pay for almost anything from restaurants to subway rides through WeChat Pay, a mobile payment service provided by Tencent Holdings Ltd., owner of popular messaging app WeChat with over 1.25 billion monthly active users.Now the use of WeChat Pay is further expanded. Tencent announced Thursday that WeChat Pay is accessible by Cloud QuickPass, the mobile payment service of state-backed UnionPay.UnionPay is the world\u2019s biggest card network with more than 9 billion cards issued. It is widely used by Chinese shoppers internationally as well as domestically. UnionPay\u2019s QuickPass is accepted at 25 million POS terminals, including more than 7 million POS terminals in 82 countries and regions outside mainland China.The collaboration enables QuickPass users to make payments by scanning WeChat Pay QR codes offline, and for WeChat Pay users to do the same with QuickPass codes in provincial capitals across the country.QuickPass payment now supports some Tencent services, such as its music and video streaming apps, as well as WeChat mini-programs for WeChat Read, JD.com, and Luckin Coffee, Tencent said.WeChat Pay has previously connected with mobile banking apps of a number of banks, including China Construction Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Ping An Bank and Citic Bank.Caixin learned that Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is also testing collaboration with QuickPass by allowing users to scan each other\u2019s QR codes.But industry experts said the mutual scanning and recognition between QR codes does not equal real interconnection between different payment services, because each service still uses its own QR code system.QR code is a machine-readable code typically used for storing URLs or other information for reading by the camera on a smartphone. The QR code system allows shoppers to make quick payments by scanning a code provided by merchants or by asking the business to scan a code generated by a mobile payment app.At present, China doesn\u2019t have a unified technical standard of QR code payment interconnection. Payment providers issue different barcodes that can be used only on their own services.In August 2019, the central bank issued a three-year plan to build a regulatory framework to unify technology standards and promote interoperability of the QR code payment service. Under the plan, by the end of 2021 all merchants will be able to use one universal barcode to facilitate transactions through different payment service providers, including banks, Alipay and WeChat Pay.The central bank will push internet firms to open up their payment scenarios to each other to guarantee consumers' choice, central bank governor Yi Gang recently said.Antitrust actions in the payment sector need to deepen despite \"interim progress\" made in the last year, People\u2019s Bank of China deputy governor Fan Yifei said last Friday at the China Payment and Clearing Forum in Beijing.Alibaba recently added the rival WeChat Pay system to some of its apps after the government ordered major tech firms to stop blocking each other\u2019s services and links.Services including food-delivery app Ele.me, online ticketing platform Damai, e-book reader Shuqi, and Kaola, a site for imported goods, now offer WeChat Pay alongside Alipay.Contact reporter Denise Jia (huijuanjia@caixin.com)Download our app to receive breaking news alerts and read the news on the go.Get our weekly free Must-Read newsletter.",

The video highlighted the close resemblance that the new video for 3D mobile game, \"Douluo Continent 3D: Soul Master Duel\" bore to a 2019 trailer for Japanese gaming firm Square Enix's \"Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers.\"In the comparison video, \"Douluo Continent 3D: Soul Master Duel\" character Tang San appears to move and fight adversaries in a similar way to Final Fantasy XIV's Warrior of Light.\"Douluo Continent 3D: Soul Master Duel\" (which is known as Soul Land: Awaken Warsoul in its English iteration) launched beta runs in May and June, and officially launched this July.

After the transaction, Sogou became an indirect subsidiary of Tencent, according to the company\u2019s statement.Sogou\u2019s business and products will be absorbed into corresponding departments that are part of Tencent\u2019s Platform and Content Group. These include its search engine, AI services, input method, browser, reader, and other products. However, search engine and input method products, which are the most popular among users, will continue to operate under the Sogou brand, according to Tencent Technology, a media subsidiary of Tencent.Tencent first sought to buy Sogou privately in July 2020, when it signed an agreement with Sogou to acquire all of its outstanding shares not owned by Tencent at a price of USD 9 apiece, or USD 3.5 billion in total. The transaction was originally due to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2020 but was delayed because of regulatory screening.Tencent has been Sogou\u2019s second largest shareholder since 2013, when it paid USD 448 million for a 36.5% stake in the company and merged its own search engine, Soso, with Sogou. Afterwards, Sohu\u2014a media, video, and gaming business group\u2014remained the controlling shareholder of Sogou, while Sohu and Tencent held 38.1% and 36.5% of shares respectively, maintaining joint control of Sogou.At the beginning of July this year, the State Administration for Market Regulation fined Tencent RMB 500,000 (USD 77,000) for failing to report its acquisition of Sogou in 2013, but made it clear that the acquisition did not violate antitrust laws. A few days later, regulators approved the deal.As a result of the deal, Sohu received USD 1.18 billion in cash from Sogou\u2019s sale to Tencent, and no longer has any ownership interest in the company.With the acquisition of Sogou, Tencent will be able to restart its search engine business. The closed-looped WeChat content ecosystem and the search engine will feed traffic to each other.According to the latest numbers released by Statcounter, in August 2021, Baidu still ranks first among China\u2019s search engine products, occupying 76.7% of the market. Sogou ranks second with 14.3% market share, while Bing and Google control only 3.6% and 2.4% of the market, respectively.",

            "description": "China's tightening of regulations on its technology sector has raised concerns among investors globally, including in South Africa. That is because the country\u2019s stock market, home of Africa's largest bourse, is dominated by Naspers, a Cape Town-based company, which is the largest shareholder in Tencent, one of China\u2019s most valuable companies.Naspers, a once prosperous but modest Cape Town company, is now a global internet group with technology investments around the world. It started out with interests in publishing and online retail, and spent most of the 20th century publishing Afrikaans-language newspapers and magazines.However, as the millennium turned, Naspers executives questioned if they needed to transition away from newspapers to the digital realm.The Johannesburg-listed Naspers acquired 46.5 per cent of Tencent for only $32 million back in 2001, when the Chinese company was just a plucky start-up. In the years since, Naspers\u2019 stake in Tencent has whittled down to around the 29 per cent.However, the value of the stake continued to grow to a large degree, reaching about $200 billion in February \u2013 not bad for a humble newspaper company at the foot of Africa.\u201cNaspers is essentially a holding company for a big investment in Tencent,\u201d says Gary Booysen, portfolio manager at Rand Swiss, a Johannesburg investment company.This also means that, for better or worse, Naspers now completely dominates the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). \u201cNaspers is such an important part of our index that whenever there\u2019s a move in the share price, it feeds through to the index,\u201d Mr Booysen adds.Naspers has around 20 per cent weighting on the JSE benchmark index. The company has tried to reduce its crushing weight on the bourse by creating a separate entity called Prosus, which is listed in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.Prosus now holds Naspers\u2019 Tencent share and other technology stocks, while Naspers controls more than 70 per cent of Prosus. The latter is also listed on the JSE, with the net result being South African investors finding it almost impossible not to include one \u2013 or both of these counters \u2013 in their portfolios.With so many investment managers relying on exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other passive index-related instruments, both these shares now underpin the country\u2019s savings industry, according to David Shapiro, chief global equity strategist at Johannesburg-based Sasfin Securities.\u201cWe\u2019ve shifted to index investing, exchange-traded funds and the like, and many of those have large exposure to Naspers and Prosus,\u201d he says.The current meltdown in Chinese tech stocks such as Alibaba and Tencent \u2013 the top two most valuable companies in China \u2013 has agonised their shareholders, including Naspers. With so many portfolios exposed to China, it means many South African investors can do little but sit and hope for the situation to reverse.\u201cIt\u2019s hurting the savings of this country and there\u2019s no way out,\u201d Mr Shapiro says.Naspers itself is aware of its uneasy position as a shareholder in a runaway titan and has used some of the money pouring in to buy other assets to diversify.This month, Prosus said it would purchase Indian payments platform BillDesk for $4.7bn, which will complement PayU, the platform Naspers already owns.\u201cTogether, the two expect to create a financial ecosystem handling four billion transactions annually \u2013 four times PayU\u2019s current level in India,\u201d Prosus said in August. It has also reduced its holding in Tencent, selling a 2 per cent stake in 2018, which raised around $10bn to fund other investments.However, given the sheer size of the company and the persistent underlying dependence on Tencent for its value, Naspers\u2019 share price has continued to decline over the past year. While Tencent has lost around 40 per cent of its all-time high share price, Naspers has declined about 25 per cent.A steady trickle of new rules by Chinese regulators \u2013 such as putting limits on how many hours children can play video games and banning private tutors from giving classes online \u2013 continue to cause concern for Tencent investors.South African investors can now only wait and hope that regulators have gone as far as they can, says Peter Armitage, chief executive of Johannesburg-based Anchor Capital.\u201cIt\u2019s probably gotten as close to what regulators want to do. Probably, in hindsight, a lot of these changes could have been predicted.\u201d",

The most popular games in the country are made for smartphones and are free to play, meaning the businesses making them live and die based on how well they draw users in and get them to pay for extras. The game makers have become experts at hooking players.But top-down attempts to wean children off games \u2014 what state media has called \u201cpoison\u201d and \u201cspiritual pollution\u201d \u2014 have sometimes been worse than the problem itself. Boot camps fond of military discipline have proliferated. So have Chinese media accounts of abuses, like beatings, electroconvulsive therapy and solitary confinement.Even the country\u2019s past ban on consoles like the PlayStation made things worse, Mr. Shi said. That ban helped propel the popularity of the free-to-play mobile games. Studios selling games for consoles are motivated to make high-quality games, like blockbuster movies. Not so, he said, with free-to-play games, which are motivated to maximize what they can get out of players.For Mr. Shi, the government\u2019s new limits are similar to the ones his mother imposed on him growing up. During weekdays, his PlayStation 2 stayed locked away in a cabinet. Each disc he bought was scrutinized. Plenty of them were deemed inappropriate.When he got to college, he entered a period that he called \u201cpayback,\u201d trying to make up for the years when he had strict limits. Even now, he sometimes indulges his gaming habits or spends more than he should. What\u2019s important to understand, he said, is that for a generation that grew up largely without siblings, many with parents who worked late, video games offered a portal to a social world beyond the doldrums of school pressures.",

The WIPO Center offers alternative dispute resolution (ADR) options to court litigation, enabling parties to settle their IP and technology disputes.The new service is available within Pex\u2019s Attribution Engine \u2013 a real-time marketplace that identifies, attributes, and licenses copyrighted content before it\u2019s published.Pex\u2019s Attribution Engine, which the firm has previously described as \u201cthe licensing infrastructure for a better Internet\u201d, identifies a copyright match on a platform, and then issues a license based on the rightsholder\u2019s wishes.If a creator believes their content is clear of copyright infringement, they can raise a dispute in order to clear the content for distribution.Attribution Engine then verifies if the claim is valid and informs the rightsholder. If escalation is needed, either party can request that a copyright expert, appointed by the WIPO Center, reviews and decides if a use is infringing or if it falls under an exception to copyright law.The WIPO Center maintains a list of external experts specialized in digital copyright and content. The platform is indemnified by Pex from any legal risk once they comply with the panel\u2019s decision.\u201cBy equipping Pex\u2019s dispute resolution process with the WIPO Center\u2019s appointed copyright experts, platforms won\u2019t have to make difficult judgment calls on whether content is infringing copyright,\u201d said Pex in a statement.\u201cCreators are empowered to publish content with the confidence that it won\u2019t be taken down later, and rightsholders can monitor and capitalize on the content they own.\u201d\u201cCreating this innovative procedure for copyright disputes solves an incredibly technical and legal challenge that has long impacted creators, rightsholders, and platforms.\u201d Rasty Turek, Pex\u201cCreating this innovative procedure for copyright disputes solves an incredibly technical and legal challenge that has long impacted creators, rightsholders, and platforms,\u201d said Rasty Turek, founder and CEO of Pex.\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to partner with the WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center, the global expert in intellectual property dispute resolution, in providing the full creator economy with an independent assessment for copyright dispute.\u201dMusic Business Worldwide",

            "description": "Back in May, OPPO launched the OPPO Smart TV K9 Series in China. The company debuted the television in three sizes \u2013 43-inch, 55-inch, and 65-inch. More than four months later, the firm has now announced a 75-inch version of this TV at the OPPO K9 Pro launch event yesterday (September 26).OPPO Smart TV K9 75\u201d Specifications and FeaturesThe newly launched OPPO Smart TV K9 75\u201d is similar to the OPPO Smart TV K9 65\u201d in terms of specifications. The only differences between the two are display size and storage capacity. As the name suggests, the new model sports a 75-inch screen and comes with 32GB internal storage instead of 16GB. However, the amount of RAM remains 2GB.Like most mid-range smart televisions these days, the new OPPO TV features a metal frame with a 95% screen-to-body ratio. It sports an LED-backlit (DLED) LCD panel with a resolution of 3840 x 2160 pixels (4K), 1.07 billion colors, 60Hz refresh rate with MEMC, and 300 nits brightness (typical).The display has a 93% DCI-P3 color gamut, a color accuracy of \u0394E\u22481.5, and supports multiple HDR standards (HDR10+, HDR10, HLG). It can also decode and pass HDR10+ content.The television is powered by a MediaTek MT9652 chipset. This SoC consists of a quad-core ARM Cortex-A73 CPU and an ARM Mali-G52 MC1 GPU.As for software, it runs ColorOS TV 2.0 with support for leading streaming platforms in China, Xiaobu (Breeno) voice assistant via far-field microphones, NFC-enabled remote control for quick pairing with OPPO smartphones, Tencent START cloud gaming, O Relax, and more.On the connectivity front, the television arrives with dual-band WiFi, Bluetooth 5.0, 3 x HDMI 2.1 (one of them is eARC compatible), 2 x USB 2.0, 3-in-1 AV, digital audio port (optical), DTMB, and Ethernet.Last but not least, television features a 2-unit speaker system with a maximum output of 30W and Dolby Audio support.

But as part of the launch offer, the company is providing a \u00a5300 ($47) discount. Hence, customers can purchase the television for \u00a55,499 ($851).Additionally, OPPO is also giving away a webcam worth \u00a5399 ($62) and Tencent streaming subscription as freebies.The television is already up for pre-order in the country and will go on sale for the first time on September 30.Just like the previous models in the lineup, we don\u2019t think this TV will make its way to international markets.",

            "description": "WeChat app is seen on a smartphone in this illustration taken, July 13, 2021. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration Acquire Licensing RightsSHANGHAI, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Tencent Holdings's (0700.HK) popular WeChat messaging app will start allowing users to access external links from Friday, days after regulators told the company and its rivals to end a long-standing practice of blocking each other's links.China's technology giants have historically prevented links and services by rivals from being shared on their platforms. On Monday, however, regulators said they were ordering firms to rectify this as the practice affected users' experience and damaged consumer rights. read moreThe move is part of a broader regulatory crackdown on the industry that has wiped billions of dollars off the market value of some of China's largest companies.WeChat said on Friday that it will implement the changes in phases, starting with allowing users to access links in private, one-to-one chats once they upgraded to the latest version of WeChat, although it would continue to follow principles such as preventing excessive marketing.The plan will be carried out based on legal requirements and with the approval of regulatory authorities, it added.\"At the same time, WeChat will also actively cooperate with other Internet platforms to implement this guidance and explore the technical possibilities of using WeChat services on other platforms, to achieve further interconnectivity.\"Under the old practice, WeChat users were not able to click directly through links to e-commerce marketplaces such as Taobao and Tmall, which are operated by Alibaba Group (9988.HK).Instead they would be asked to open the link in a browser like Safari, which many had found problematic.Tencent has also restricted users from sharing content from ByteDance-owned short video app Douyin on WeChat and QQ, another Tencent messaging app. In February, Douyin filed a complaint with a Beijing court saying it constituted monopolistic behaviour. Tencent has called those accusations baseless.Reporting by Brenda Goh; editing by Elaine HardcastleOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "description": "Li Zhanguo's two children, ages 4 and 8, don't have their own smartphones, but like millions of other Chinese children, they are no strangers to online gaming.\"If my children get their hands on our mobile phones or an iPad, and if we don't closely monitor their screen time, they can play online games for as long as three to four hours each time,\" he said.Not anymore.Like many other parents, Li is happy with new government restrictions that limit children to just three hours weekly of online gaming time \u2014 an hour between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. on Friday, Saturday and Sunday most weeks.The restrictions, which took effect earlier this month, are a tightening of 2019 rules that banned children from gaming overnight and limited them to 90 minutes most weekdays.Experts say it's unclear if such policies can help prevent addiction to online games, since children might just get engrossed in social media instead. Ultimately, they say, it's up to parents to nurture good habits and set screen time limits.The new rules are part of a campaign to prevent kids from spending too much time on entertainment that communist authorities consider unhealthy. That also includes what officials call the \"irrational fan culture\" of worshipping celebrities.The technology restrictions reflect growing concern over gaming addiction among children. One state media outlet has called online games \"spiritual opium,\" an allusion to past eras when addiction to the drug was widespread in China.Adolescents are the future of the motherland, and protecting the physical and mental health of minors is related to the vital interests of masses, and in cultivating newcomers in the era of national rejuvenation,\" the Press and Publications Administration said in a statement, alluding to a campaign by Chinese President Xi Jinping to cultivate a healthier society for a more powerful China.Government reports in 2018 estimated that one in 10 Chinese minors were addicted to the internet. Centers have sprung up to diagnose and treat such problems.Under the new regulations, the responsibility for ensuring that children play only three hours a day falls largely on Chinese gaming companies like and , whose wildly popular Honor of Kings mobile game is played by tens of millions across the country.Companies have set up real-name registration systems to prevent young users from exceeding their game time limits, and have incorporated facial recognition checks that require users to verify their identities.In some cases, companies will do sporadic facial recognition checks while people are playing, and they'll be booted out of the game if they fail.Regulators also ordered gaming companies to tighten examinations of their games to ensure they don't include harmful content such as violence.And they've set up a platform that allows people who hold Chinese ID cards to report on gaming companies they believe are violating restrictions.It's unclear what penalties companies may face if they fail to enforce the regulations.And even if such blanket policies are enforced, it is also unclear whether they can prevent online addiction, given that game companies design their products to entice players to stay online and come back for more, said Barry Ip, a senior lecturer at the University of Hertfordshire in England who has researched gaming and addiction. Children may just switch to other apps if they are forced to stop playing games.There are many forms of digital platforms that could potentially hold a young person's attention just as well as gaming,\" Ip said. \"It's just as easy for a young person to spend four hours on TikTok in the evening rather than play games if their time is uncontrolled.Short-video apps such as Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, are extremely popular in China and are not subject to the same restrictions as games, though they do have \"youth mode\" features enabling parents to limit what children watch and for how long.\"Many parents attribute their children's suffering grades to gaming, but I disagree with this sentiment,\" said Liu Yanbin, mother of a 9-year-old daughter in Shanghai. \"As long as children don't want to study, they will find some way to play. Games may be restricted now but there's always short video, social media, even television dramas.\"Tao Ran, director of the Adolescent Psychological Development Base in Beijing, which specializes in treating internet addiction, expects about 20% of kids will find workarounds for the rules.Some minors are too smart, if you have a system in place to restrict them from gaming they will try to beat the system by borrowing accounts of their older relatives and find a way around facial recognition,\" Tao said.The new rules, he said, are a \"last resort.\"Instead of relying on the government to intervene, parents need to take responsibility for limiting time spent on games, social media or the internet, experts say.\"The focus should be made on prevention, for example, informing parents about how games function, so that they are in a better position to regulate the involvement of their children,\" said Jo\u00ebl Billieux, a psychology professor at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland.Li, the father of two young children, said he plans to arrange piano lessons for his daughter, since she has shown an interest in learning the instrument.\"Sometimes due to work, parents may not have time to pay attention to their children and that's why many kids turn to games to spend time,\" he said. \"Parents must be willing to help children cultivate hobbies and interests so that they can develop in a healthy manner.\"___Associated Press researcher Chen Si in Shanghai and video producer Caroline Chen in Beijing contributed to this story.",

They announced an investigation into Didi Global Inc(DIDI.N) and ordered the removal of its apps for download in China days after the ride-sharing giant's initial public offering in New York.The crackdown has sparked investor concerns over policy changes and wiped off hundreds of billions of dollars in market value from some of China's largest companies including Alibaba Group Holding Limited (9988.HK) and Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK). Investor concerns this week that property developer China Evergrande could default on its massive debt pile have added to the market jitters. read more\"We at Carlyle are very strategically committed to that region and we have seen these types of bumps in the middle of the night in that part of the world,\" Lee said in an interview at a Reuters Newsmaker event in New York when asked about the impact of China's restrictions on companies.Lee said that sophisticated investors such as sovereign wealth funds and pension plans remain underinvested in China, the world's second-largest economy, and that there were still opportunities available to investment firms with local expertise such as Carlyle that can navigate the country's complex regulatory environment.Carlyle, which had $276 billion in assets under management as of the end of June, continues to be focused on the rise of consumers in China, its under-penetrated healthcare sector, and Chinese technology firms, Lee said.On the drive toward sustainability and environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG), Lee said that in the first half of this year nearly 60% of the board directors who joined companies that have been controlled by Carlyle for at least two years were from diverse backgrounds, putting it ahead of its 30% target.He also said that even companies whose business contributes to climate change can be good ESG investments if their track record improves sufficiently.\"I think people have to also understand that you have to invest in traditional companies to provide capital to enable them to transition,\" he said.Lee has been rolling out changes to improve Carlyle's fee-related earnings and boost its share price, which has doubled in the last 12 months. He said the firm's strategic plan was paying off, with the pace of fundraising and investing rapidly accelerating and performance fees hitting a record.Reporting by Chibuike Oguh in New York Editing by Matthew LewisOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

Grainge joined UMG in 1986 and has been CEO since 2010. Vallejo, who is based in the company\u2019s Netherlands corporate headquarters, joined the company in April and has been with UMG\u2019s soon-to-be-former-parent-company Vivendi since 1998.Every public company must have a board of directors, a governing body whose members act in the best interest of the shareholders. Their duties include things like setting company goals, establishing stock option policies, leading acquisitions and mergers and deciding on executives\u2019 salaries.The rest of the oversight group at UMG comprises eight non-executive directors, meaning they are not UMG executives, including a chairman of the board and vice chairman of the board. The four titled \u201cindependent non-executive director\u201d have no connection to UMG, but the four titled simply \u201cnon-executive director\u201d have another connection to UMG, such as representing a major shareholder.The chairman of the board and independent non-executive director, who will call and direct meetings, is Judy Craymer, an award-winning producer who originated the idea for the Mamma Mia! musical (and later, film) and co-founded production company Littlestar Services Ltd. alongside ABBA members Benny Andersson and Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus and producer Richard East. The vice chairman of the board, and an independent non-executive director, is Antoine Fievet, who has spent 20 years as CEO of branded cheese and snack company the Bel Group \u2013 purveyor of brands Babybel and Boursin \u2013 where he has additionally served as chairman since 2009.The other independent non-executive directors are Anna Jones, the co-founder and CEO of global women\u2019s club AllBright; and Margaret Frerejean-Taittinger, the international development manager for the Michelin Guide restaurant ratings system.The non-executive directors include Cathia Lawson-Hall, the head of coverage and investment banking for Africa at global financial services leader Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale; and Luc Van Os; the former CEO of Hearst Netherlands who now co-owns Misset Uitgeverij, a Netherlands-based B2B publisher of multimedia brands for the agricultural sector.James Mitchell and Manning Doherty are both non-executive directors with ties to China\u2019s Tencent Holdings Limited, the leader of a consortium that now owns 20% of UMG \u2013 fittingly giving Tencent 20% of the board seats.Mitchell is Tencent Holdings\u2019 senior executive vp and chief strategy officer and a director at Tencent Music Entertainment Group. Doherty is senior vp of GIC Pte Ltd., Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund \u2013 which is a part of the Tencent-led consortium \u2013 where he focuses on public and private debt and equity investments globally.Notably, half of the eight non-executive directors are women, including the chairman of the board. Looking at racial diversity, Lawson-Hall is the only Black board member while Mitchell and Doherty are both of Asian descent. Executive director Vallejo, the company\u2019s deputy CEO corporate, is half-Spanish.The prospectus notes that until recently, Dutch law stated that certain large Dutch companies, including UMG, must have at least 30% men and 30% women comprise their boards of directors. This legislation expired at the end of 2019, but in February, a bill was submitted to the Senate and Dutch House of Representatives requiring that board appointments not only maintain those percentages, but that new appointments lead to a more balanced gender ratio, or else they\u2019ll be voided. In the U.S., only 22.5% of board seats in the Fortune 500 are held by women, and 4.6% are held by women of color, according to Catalyst, a nonprofit supporting professional women.All appointments are effective on Sept. 20 and will serve until UMG\u2019s annual general meeting in 2024.",

What exactly are these things?YZ: We\u2019re going to create more content that spans different fields. For example, at first we had to outsource our animations, but now that we have adequate manpower, we have the luxury of forming an internal animation team. So future game trailers and movies can be made with our internal team. Since we\u2019re looking at making a GF IP, the amount of resources and funding needed are quite significant.Also, we will continue with our strategy of pursuing multiple. The \u201cfour from one\u201d plan we went with previously was based on the pretext of a stable income supply and the team being able to support it, but the fact is that our funds and manpower back then were limited, so we had to work smart to make up for our deficiencies. But after Tencent\u2019s investment and as our future projects start coming online, we can accelerate the implementation of many plans and ideas, we can produce things more efficiently and greatly improve the quality of our games.

When they contacted us around March, we expected that it would take until the latter half of the year to take care of things, but in the end it was done by April, much more quickly than we expected.

What do the people in your company think of all this?YZ: Of course everyone was pretty happy about the bonus, and naturally everyone was concerned about whether Tencent would try to take a controlling share of the stock, or interfere with game development, or if they would want to take over publishing. We explained internally that this was nothing more that a tactical investment and that it would not affect company policy. Everyone could also feel the company picking up the pace, so on the whole, everyone approved of the deal.SAMG: I\u2019ve always been curious about something. Sunborn has always given the impression of being very low-key, but then you suddenly released a lot of news at once, such as developing 4 games at once, hosting a massive carnival, getting the Tencent investment and so on. Why did you suddenly decide to declare your presence to the world?YZ: That was actually part of our plan. Before this, we felt that we ought to carefully polish our products and put our effort into doing what we ought to do. The four games were essentially on track by the time we announced them, so at that stage we felt that we needed to let the world know we were building up to something. We couldn\u2019t just do it and be done with it. What\u2019s that saying\u2026 \u201cIf you\u2019ve got it, flaunt it?\u201d Competition on the market now is really intense, so we can\u2019t just develop a game, we also need to carefully handle each step and component of publishing and marketing too.",

It has nearly doubled Cars24\u2019s valuation to $1.84 billion from $1 billion last November.The fundraise included debt of $110 million from multiple financial institutions, according to a company statement.Cars24 plans to use the fresh capital to deepen its presence in the United Arab Emirates and Australian markets, where it has made recent forays, and build its cars, bikes and financing business in India while investing in technology.Demand for used vehicles has been rising in India since the covid outbreak as fear of infections prompts more people to opt for personal mobility. This has also turned investor attention towards this segment.In July, Droom Technology said it was raising $200 million in a pre-IPO funding round at a valuation of $1.2 billion, catapulting the online automobile marketplace into a unicorn\u2014a startup with a valuation of at least $1 billion.Droom plans to make a public listing next year.The same month, pre-owned cars platform Spinny raised \u20b9771.5 crore in a new funding round led by Tiger Global Management.Last month, CarTrade got listed on the domestic stock exchanges. However, CarDekho, another online platform for used vehicles, is shuttering more than a third of its offline Gaadi retail stores across India, potentially due to the impact of the pandemic on customer visits to brick-and-mortar stores.\u201cTraditionally, car selling or buying have been a tiresome process, and only two of 100 people own cars in India. With this investment, we will continue to penetrate the existing car, bikes and financing business in India while venturing into new overseas geographies this year,\" said Vikram Chopra, co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of Cars24.The Gurugram-based startup was founded in 2015 by Chopra, Mehul Agrawal, Ruchit Agarwal and Gajendra Jangid.Cars24 has sold more than 1,000 cars in the UAE since launching operations there in April this year. It also entered the Australian market last week.\u201cCars24 is at the forefront of transforming the way consumers buy and sell cars by providing a unique end-to-end digital shopping and transaction experience,\" said Rahul Mehta, managing partner at DST Global.According to data intelligence platform VCCEdge, Cars24 clocked \u20b92,998.14 crore in net sales in fiscal 2020\u2014the latest available data\u2014up from \u20b91,654.61 in the previous year. In comparison, rival CarTrade recorded operating revenue of \u20b9298.2 crore in the same period.Cars24 raised $200 million as part of its Series E funding round last November at a valuation of $1 billion. The funding round led by DST Global turned the online used vehicle platform into a unicorn.Before this round, Cars24 had raised $100 million in a Series D funding round from both existing and new investors in October 2019.Milestone Alert!Livemint tops charts as the fastest growing news website in the world \ud83c\udf0f Click here to know more.",

            "description": "Chinese regulators have summoned companies to demand they play down profits and further clamp down on how minors can play video games, just days after children in the country were banned from access during the week.State-run news agency Xinhua reported Wednesday that authorities had called in firms, including industry leaders Tencent and NetEase, to discuss restrictions around the streaming and playing of video games among minors.[Tencent owns 40% of Cary, N.C.-based Epic Games, the publisher of the globally popular \u201cFortnite.\u201d]During the meeting, companies were \u201curged to break from the solitary focus of pursuing profit or attracting players and fans,\u201d according to the report. They were also told to modify any rules or design elements of games that could be seen as \u201cinducing addictions.\u201dThe discussions included representatives from four government agencies: the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, the National Press and Publication Administration, the Office of the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, according to Xinhua.\u201cCompanies failing to follow the requirements will be stringently punished,\u201d the state news agency reported.Shares of Chinese gaming companies fell in response to the news. NetEase\u2019s stock closed down 5.2% in New York on Wednesday, after the state media report was published, and Tencent shares dropped 6% in Hong Kong on Thursday.Just last week, China barred online gamers under the age of 18 from playing on weekdays and limited their play to just three hours most weekends, marking a significant escalation of restrictions on the country\u2019s massive gaming industry.The move represented a huge tightening of earlier limits set by the agency in 2019, which had already restricted play to 90 minutes on weekdays and three hours on weekends for children.Authorities said last week that the new restrictions were put in place to help prevent young people from becoming addicted to video games.They reminded companies of this mandate on Wednesday, saying that game providers should \u201cfully and faithfully impose the time limit\u201d for minors.\u201cOnline game companies and platforms \u2026 should strengthen political positions and shoulder responsibilities,\u201d Xinhua wrote.It said that authorities had instructed companies to crack down on content that promoted \u201cwrong values\u201d or an \u201cunhealthy culture,\u201d such as obscenity, violence and \u201cmoney-worship.\u201dLive-stream gaming platforms were also told to step up supervision, \u201cincluding banning large rewards\u201d for underage players.Companies are heeding the warning.\u201cWe believe in healthy game play and take very seriously the physical and mental health of minors,\u201d Tencent said in a statement.\u201cWe appreciate the guidance and instruction from the relevant regulators, and will work hard to be in full compliance with all rules relating to youth game addiction and content regulation.\u201dNetEase also pledged to \u201cstrictly follow the rules and instructions.\u201d\u201cWe will continue our efforts to deliver more quality games and promote a healthy and responsible gaming environment for minor players, as we seek to build and promote a wholesome gaming environment in China,\u201d it said in a statement.The news comes as some critics have pointed to potential loopholes in the latest restrictions.On Wednesday, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported that some online video game stores \u201cdo not verify the age of buyers, and won\u2019t dissuade buyers even if they are aware that they are minors.\u201dSome stores even advertise that they are not part of the \u201caddiction prevention\u201d campaign, according to CCTV.\u2014 CNN\u2019s Beijing bureau contributed to this report.The-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

            "description": "Beijing has yet again slapped regulations on Big Tech in China. This time, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has told app makers and web sites to stop blocking links to their rivals, or face the consequences.In a Q&A session at the start of the week on manufacturing and cyber development, MIIT spokesperson Zhao Zhiguo said this practice of restricting access to external services damages the rights of users and unfairly disrupts the market.The g-man said the action was prompted by complaints logged by the Ministry, and added that companies would be allowed to self-examine and correct their policies before any punishment is decided.\"We are going to step up regulation, supervision and monitoring through a number of means. We hope that these problems can be rectified. For those enterprises who are failing to correct their measures, we will issue punishments,\" said Zhao speaking in Chinese, adding: \"Eventually we are going to form an ecosystem where different platforms can access one another without blockage without limitation.\"Zhao did not specify what the consequences would be for organizations that failed to abide by the new rules. He also did not specify which companies triggered the regulations, although he did cite instant-messaging platforms as a potential offender.That said, a Chinese publication reported Alibaba and Tencent attended a meeting with the Ministry on September 9 in which they were informed of the incoming rules and were told to end the practice of blocking access to competitors. Both businesses later said they agreed to fall in line. Huawei, Baidu, ByteDance, and Xiaomi were also in attendance.This behavior of preventing access to rival services is \u2013 or rather was \u2013 commonplace in China. For example, Tencent's payment platform WeChat Pay is unavailable when using Alibaba's e-commerce sites, and Alibaba's services can't be used via WeChat Pay, either.Furthermore, ByteDance, the maker of TikTok, sued Tencent in February, alleging the latter's WeChat and QQ messaging services wouldn't allow links to content on the Chinese version of TikTok, Douyin.Recently Beijing instituted a slate of regulations and crackdowns on tech companies, including those that prevent monopolistic behavior. In July, the Chinese government's antitrust watchdog State Administration of Market Supervision (SAMR) banned the merger of Tencent gaming outfits Huya and DouYu.Alibaba\u2019s finance arm Ant Group was forced to restructure its loans business before being allowed to operate as a consumer finance company in June.Back in November 2020, SAMR announced a complete overhaul of anti-monopoly laws, including a review of consumer-protection rules and truth in advertising, and pondering whether the structure of the market in the internet-era permits competition.But it's not just monopolistic behavior that the Chinese government is looking to control and curtail. Data management and storage is another area Beijing has used to lasso in industry.In July 2021, Chinese Uber-like DiDi was booted from the nation's app stores on the grounds it was not compliant with Beijing's privacy rules just ahead of its US IPO.In May, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) ordered 105 apps to stop improperly collecting and using personal data, including LinkedIn, Big, Douyin, TikTok and Baidu.As for Alibaba and Tencent, shares fell on Monday for both in the single digits. For Alibaba, the fall comes amid reports that Beijing seeks to break up its financial payments arm Alipay. \u00ae",

            "description": "Amid the crackdown on big tech, fintech, edtech, gaming and entertainment industry, 14 Chinese online content platforms have signed a proclamation calling for \"self-discipline\" that promises to assist the CCP government in enforcing order online.From fintech to edtech and now the gaming industry, the government of the People's Republic of China continues to stifle the country's domestic technology companies.As the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has been trying to reign over industry behemoths, 14 Chinese online content platforms have signed a proclamation calling for \"self-discipline\" in the country's cyberspace.The China Association of Performing Arts (CAPA) said it met with platform representatives, who pledged to promote only \"healthy\" content with positive values, to avoid using data and traffic as their primary guides and to stop encouraging \"false hype\".The Chinese version of TikTok, known as Douyin, the Twitter-like social media platform Weibo and the popular video-sharing platform Kuaishou are among those companies which signed the collective declaration.In the second quarter of 2021, Weibo was predicted to have 566 million monthly active users. In the first quarter of this year, Douyin had about 600 million daily active users, while Kuaishou had more than 379 million daily active users in the first three months of 2021.Additionally, iQiyi, Tencent Video, QQ Music, Youku, Kugou Music, Bilibili, Kuwo Music, Migu Video, and Migu Music, as well as news aggregator Today's Toutiao and product review and popular blogging site Xiaohongshu, all signed the agreement.Among all these companies, Tencent announced on its official Weibo account that it would work to foster a clean and upright online culture. As per early reports, Beijing filed a civil suit against this Shenzhen-based company \"over claims its messaging-app WeChat's Youth Mode does not comply with laws protecting minors\".Story continuesAll these Chinese companies presented a list of actions in the form of a \"Self-Discipline Convention\" on 11 September that promises to assist the CCP government in enforcing order online.According to the deal, these Chinese companies would strictly police the behaviour of fans and crackdown on malicious celebrity gossip, reported Reuters. It also includes broader censorship provisions, such as fans of celebrities are prohibited from \"inciting conflict,\" soliciting funds to promote their favourite stars and arranging unauthorised public meetings.Under this Self-Discipline Convention, if fans are found to be breaking these rules, then they may have their accounts, bulletin boards and groups restricted, muted, suspended or deleted entirely.As reported, one part of the deal states: \"The participating platforms reached a consensus that in order to maintain a clean cyberspace environment and strengthen the construction of online cultural content, companies should carry out more proactive self-discipline.\"After a string of controversies involving artists, China tightened down on what it called a \"chaotic\" celebrity fan culture in August, prohibiting websites from publishing popularity lists and controlling the sale of fan items.The Chinese internet watchdog said that it would take action against the transmission of \"harmful information\" in celebrity fan clubs, as well as shut down discussion channels that disseminate celebrity scandals or \"provoke trouble,\" reported Reuters. Even in June, the regulators threatened with a similar tone after turning their attention to the so-called \"toxic fan behaviour\".Since then, reports have showcased the wave of new regulations in China, after a series of high-profile celebrity scandals. For example, CCP targeted some of the country's most well-known figures, including movie star Zhao Wei, whose personal and professional presence was deleted from China's internet services without explanation.Popular Chinese actress Zheng Shuang was fined $46 million for tax evasion, while Chinese-Canadian pop sensation Kris Wu was heavily censored on the internet after being detained on accusations of rape in August.Additionally, Chinese internet regulators have also urged broadcasters to avoid \"abnormal aesthetics\", such as \"sissy\" men and to promote more manly portrayals in programming and instructed broadcasters to remove artists who take \"incorrect political positions\" from their programmes.Reports also revealed that last week, Weibo suspended 21 K-Pop fan accounts, including those supporting Blackpink and BTS, for \"irrational star-chasing behaviour,\" which, according to Weibo, has violated its community guidelines.Earlier this year, iQiyi, which is China's Netflix equivalent, drew criticism after fans of one of its talent shows were filmed wasting milk in order to qualify to vote. iQiyi announced in August that it would no longer broadcast idol competition shows.Separately, Chinese video platforms removed films starring or directed by Zhao, citing \"relevant laws and regulations,\" sparking widespread online speculation. However, Pulin Saisi, Zhao's management agency said that it had no knowledge of the situation.The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) earlier said in a statement that the regulators need to \"increase their sense of responsibility, mission and urgency to maintain online political and ideological security\".The country has strict rules on content ranging from video games to movies to music, and it censors anything it deems to be in violation of core socialist values. The crackdown on celebrity fan culture and the declaration by those 14 companies come during a broader regulatory campaign against the country's internet behemoths.",

In a statement, China's propaganda department, cyberspace regulator and other authorities said they would \"seriously deal with\" any violations of their rules.But share price losses accelerated in afternoon trade after the South China Morning Post, citing people familiar with the matter, reported Beijing had temporarily frozen game approvals. The SCMP later issued a correction after the market close to clarify regulators are slowing the approvals process, rather than suspending it. CNBC was unable to immediately confirm the report.The last time this happened was in 2018, when regulators froze game approvals over concerns about children's eyesight. It hit Tencent and NetEase, China's two biggest online gaming players.During the interview on Wednesday between regulators and gaming firms, authorities reminded the firms that they need to limit game time for children under 18 years of age. Under rules announced last month, kids are not allowed to play online games for more than 3 hours per week \u2014 and only during specific times and days. The Chinese government has long been concerned about the impact of gaming on the physical and mental health of children.",

            "description": "Two digital giants dominated the Chinese market list in Campaign's recent survey of consumer opinions, Asia\u2019s Top 1000 Brands, conducted in partnership with Nielsen IQ. Alibaba and Tencent's expansive ecosystems cover a range of industries\u2014the below image shows the brands that featured in our list of China's top 100 brands.Tencent is known as an \"investment powerhouse\", having invested in many Chinese high-tech companies from Pinduoduo to JD, from Kuaishou to Sogou, from Meituan to iQiyi. The Chinese conglomerate is also deeply involved in the gaming industry at home and abroad.Meanwhile, Alibaba has shares in five Chinese private courier service companies\u2014with SF express as the only exception\u2014as it seeks to build out its Cainiao express logistics network for its ecommerce behemoths, Tmall and Taobao. Fast-growing Chinese furniture brand Macalline used to cooperate with Tencent. Since Alibaba became its second-largest shareholder two years ago, Macalline made significant progress on both the overall Asia\u2019s Top 1000 Brands list and the Chinese top 100, winning support and popularity from Alibaba's ecommerce platform Tmall.Alibaba and Tencent have stakes in several of the same companies. Didi Chuxing and Bilibili are major brands that both Alibaba and Tencent have invested in. Red (Xiaohongshu or Little Red Book), valued at US$10 billion as a unicorn, is a rising-star social-media app and seed-planting ecommerce platform in China that both giants have financed.But they are also fiercely competitive. Over the past decade, they have built their own walled gardens, preventing any interoperability for consumers and marketers. For example, Tencent prevents consumers from sharing links from Taobao or Tmall in the WeChat ecosystem. Consumers cannot use Tencent\u2019s WeChat payment system on Alibaba platforms, and they cannot use Alipay for Meituan.However, with Chinese regulators taking a much more active stance on monopolistic practices in the market, the two giants are reportedly considering a possible opening-up of their walled gardens.Even simply reducing some of the virtual barriers between the two giants could change the internet in China significantly. Campaign asked marketing and branding experts for their thoughts on the duopoly and how an opening up of their ecosystems could affect both consumers and marketers. Joining us are:Greg Paull, co-founder and principal at R3R3 Kaitlin Zhang, founder and CEO of Oval BrandingArnold Ma, founder of QuminFlorian Muller, consulting director at Artefact(From left to right, Arnold Ma, Kaitlin Zhang, Greg Paull, Florian Muller)Campaign: In the Chinese market brands mostly face two choices: working with Alibaba or Tencent. Is this restrictive for marketers, brands and consumers?Florian Muller, Artefact: Historically, Alibaba was trying to develop some exclusivity partnerships with brands. Given the fast evolution of the ecommerce and social landscape, these exclusivity agreements are getting fewer and fewer. It is important for brands to play on different platforms according to their value proposition and target audience. For example, Alibaba has a core strength in commerce, while Tencent is focusing on social and entertainment. The brands must strategically play with different platforms to drive users and clients along the AIPL (awareness, interest, purchase, loyalty).Greg Paull, R3: It has been a duopoly for over a decade, but the option has never been either/or. Brands need to have a presence on both Alibaba and Tencent platforms, and this has come at a cost for marketers. However, the strength of social commerce is changing retail dynamics. Social platforms like WeChat, Douyin, and Kuaishou are making ecommerce easier\u2014consumers prefer shopping this way because they can interact with multiple touchpoints without having to leave a single app. As a result, marketers are paying more attention to these social platforms and increasing their investment.Kaitlin Zhang, Oval Branding: For most Chinese consumers, it means switching between the two services seamlessly, in the palm of their hands. As an example, almost everyone in China uses both Alipay and WeChat Pay. Although there are different consumer habits and preferences attached to each platform. The consumers will always choose what is the most convenient and useful to them. Many marketers and brands are highly aware of the battle between Alibaba and Tencent. It can cause a headache sometimes, especially for foreign brands who want to enter the Chinese domestic market. New brands need to conduct in-depth market research to understand the difference.Arnold Ma, Qumin: Alibaba or Tencent do dominate, but it\u2019s not restrictive. Some of the largest platforms are owned by these two tech giants. However, more and more, there are alternative choices for brands. For example, Bytedance\u2019s Douyin (Chinese Tiktok). In my opinion, it is the single best platform right now for building awareness in China, especially for brands starting from a zero base. Platforms like Douyin and Little Red Book are also fantastic for social and live commerce. Especially Red, where it has the highest social commerce conversion rate compared to Douyin and Kaishou, which is 2-3 times higher.How expansive are Alibaba and Tencent's ecosystems?Zhang: Almost all the apps a Chinese person will use throughout the day will be linked to Alibaba or Tencent. They permeate in every aspect of life such as education, health, transportation, food, finance. Even products and services that are seemingly unrelated to them could have been developed by them or have received investment from them. Brand extensions that are distinct from the parent brand can protect the parent if the new brands fail. Distinct new brands are useful for testing in a fast-changing and fast-failing marketplace like China.Muller: Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, Bytedance... have all developed multi-platform strategies to increase users and revenue streams but more importantly to bring a sticky ecosystem of platforms that is generating a wide range of user data. Eventually, the core value of these companies is to get a comprehensive profiling of their users through wide data generation (socio-demographic, transaction, behaviour, social) in order to provide brands with very accurate marketing tools.Paull: Most of China\u2019s platforms are owned by four big giants. Alibaba and Tencent are the Top 2.Ma: [They own many brands but] this is changing very quickly. Not just because competitors are innovating, but also the state is looking to curb the oligopoly created by Alibaba and Tencent by putting in place policies\u2014such as the recent anti-monopoly law\u2014to stop the tech giants from further market manipulation.Consumers and marketers have been blocked from operating across their two ecosystems for many years. If Alibaba and Tencent were forced to be interoperable, what could this mean for consumers, brands and marketers?Ma: This can only be good news for brands and marketers. One of the biggest issues in China is the lack of data attribution, so being able to build cross channel funnels between the biggest platforms is a benefit. This will open the doors to much better attribution modelling and spend efficiency. More so, this will start to create opportunities for other platforms, to spur more innovation in the tech/service design sector in China.Paull: Opening up walled gardens helps both Alibaba and Tencent consolidate their current market position and user base. As a result, it will create a more even competitive field. Consumers can expect greater convenience. For example, they will no longer be constrained to pay within single apps. We could even see more innovation in this space as emerging companies and start-ups will have greater opportunities to grow.Zhang: Another thing we have observed with our Chinese clients is that venture capital firms and start-ups that have received investments from one of the tech giants have to be careful to use the services in that platform\u2019s ecosystem. This can range from the obvious choice of ecommerce, payment, social media platform to less obvious connections such as hiring celebrities and influencers (KOLs) that are affiliated with the right ecosystem. If the platforms do consider opening up, marketers and brands would have more options to choose from to grow their businesses. However, that same advantage would also be available to all their competitors. Perhaps Alibaba and Tencent would have new incentives for ecosystem loyalty for brands. We\u2019ll wait and see.Muller: When we talk about opening up we need to consider two aspects: the omnichannel experience and the data. The opening may occur on the first aspect to create a more seamless consumer journey between platforms. This will aim at breaking platform siloes and reducing some monopolistic behaviours. This would not change drastically the brand approach, it should rather accelerate the multi-platform strategies where brands could easily build unique and efficient consumer journeys. On the data angle, it is highly unlikely that platforms will open up given that data is their main asset and given enforcement of new regulations for better control of data collection and usage.What is one of the trickiest aspects of operating under a duopoly that you would ideally like to fix?Ma: I think the biggest issue, in my opinion, is the lack of option to build a proper marketing/sales funnel with seamless conversions or optimisation based on understanding how your customers are moving through your marketing funnel. More often than not, when there is a duopoly, such it is in China currently, each of the larger platforms/groups would have their own strengths. One may be amazing at ecommerce (Alibaba), and the other would be fantastic at social and content (Tencent/Bytedance). Without proper cross-platform pollination, you would have to pick which platform, or rather, which stage of the funnel you would like to focus on\u2014as you will not be able to properly convert your awareness on one platform to sales on another platform seamlessly.Zhang: The Chinese market is a massive piece of pie for any duopoly to compete over. At the same time, the companies can be fixated on fighting over smaller slivers of the remaining pie, rather than expanding the pie outside of China. Many of our foreign brand clients would like better partnerships with either tech company but sometimes they find the cumbersome process and bureaucracy to be a hindrance. Some even wait years to form a partnership. Clearer policy and better customer support can help build long-lasting partnerships with foreign brands.Muller: Talking about marketing data we should always consider two types of data: marketing performance (CTR, views, ROI) and consumer data. Actually, the main impact will come from the new PIPL (Personal Information Protection Law) regulation where brands may face limitations on data that they can collect and how they can use them.Paull: Consumer ID match continues to be an issue for both ecommerce and traditional retailers with extended digital offerings. With the growth of O2O, addressing this issue will be top-of-mind with marketers.Are there any potential downsides of increased regulation of tech platforms like Alibaba and Tencent and the possible breaking up of their ecosystems?Paull: There will be a level of market uncertainty, but consumers can expect the digital ecosystem to evolve in their favour. The great thing about technology is its ability to adapt. Limitations that drive innovation and change will only create opportunities for new applications and services.Muller: The opening up would be an opportunity for brands to propose better consumer journeys. Brands must quickly adapt their digital journey not to miss this opportunity. The main area of attention should be on the compliance and adaptation of brands' practices on data usage. One of the biggest challenges on which we help our clients is to implement data governance programs to create proper data management rules in order to build a sustainable and valuable data asset in full control.Ma: We must understand these regulations are to restrict them from becoming too large and forcing exclusivity and/or stifling innovation from smaller players. So, in my view, there is very little downside. In fact, the opening up of these platforms could create much better cross-platform understanding. Or new players will pop-up that are open to better integration with each other. The strength of the close ecosystems does not out weigh the potential of open and competitive tech platforms/service design in China.",

Even before the changes, minors were restricted to 1.5 hours on weekdays and three hours on weekends.Top esports players are typically discovered in their teens and retire in their mid-20s, and experts compare the intensity of their training to that of Olympic gymnasts and divers. One of the world's most well-known players of Riot Games' \"League of Legends\", Wu Hanwei, also known as Xiye, began playing at 14 and joined a club at 16.\"The new regulations almost kill young people's chances of becoming professional esports players,\" said Chen Jiang, associate professor at Peking University's School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science.In doing so, the rules also undermine the big business of esports in China, where tournaments are often played in billion-dollar stadiums and livestreamed to many more. Chinese esport fans are estimated to number more than 400 million, according to the state-run People's Daily, while the domestic esports market was worth some 147 billion yuan ($23 billion) last year, says Chinese consultancy iResearch.[1/5]A player of Rogue Warriors esports team trains for the game \"Arena of Valor\" at his club in Shanghai, China September 3, 2021. Picture taken September 3, 2021. REUTERS/Aly Song Acquire Licensing RightsRogue Warriors, a club of 90 gamers who train in a three-floor building that includes dorms and a canteen, declined to comment on the expected impact of the new rules.An executive at another major Chinese club said the new rules will mean many talented people will miss out on being discovered.\"The real top players are usually gifted and don't necessarily play long hours before joining the club. Others can be very good eventually but they need a lot of practice to get there,\" said the executive, who declined to be named citing the sensitivity of the issue.The new rules are not laws per se that punish individuals but place the onus on gaming companies which will be compelled to require logins with real names and national ID numbers. Experts note that determined Chinese teenagers can still circumvent the rules if they have their parents' support and are able to use adult logins.Chinese authorities have not addressed the impact of the new rules on the esports industry, but Chen at Peking University said they have the leeway to grant some young esports players exemptions.\"The country can still introduce corresponding policies,\" he said.($1 = 6.4534 Chinese yuan)Reporting by Josh Horwitz in Shanghai and Sophie Yu in Beijing; Additional reporting by Thomas Suen in Beijing; Editing by Edwina GibbsOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

That is a significant reduction from previous rules. Zhang Peng | LightRocket | Getty ImagesGUANGZHOU, China \u2014 Shares of China's second-largest gaming company NetEase fell on Tuesday after regulators dramatically cut down the amount of time children were allowed to play games. NetEase was down about 2.9% in afternoon trade in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, rival Tencent was down more than 3% earlier in the day but turned positive later in the day. Analysts expect the latest directive to have minimal impact on China's gaming giants, perhaps one of the reasons Tencent shares reversed course.On Monday, China's National Press and Publication Administration said children below 18 years old will only be allowed to play online games for up to three hours a week and only during specific times. The ruling significantly reduced game time for minors who, under 2019 rules, were allowed to play for up to 90 minutes a day for most parts of the day. Gaming is the largest source of revenue for NetEase and Tencent. But analysts don't expect a huge impact on the companies as a result of the new rules. Tencent has previously said only a small amount of gaming revenue comes from younger players in China. \"We estimate about 5% of gaming revenue comes from minors under 18 years old, and we believe there is about 3% earnings impact to Tencent if we assume gaming contributes about 60% of total earnings,\" investment bank Jefferies said in a note published on Monday. \"Minors represent low singe digits of NetEase's gaming revenue,\" the analysts added.watch now",

            "description": "Tencent and NetEase can only offer online gaming to minors from 8pm to 9pm (00:00 to 01:00 GMT) on Fridays, weekends and holidays.China will limit the amount of time children can play videogames to just three hours most weeks, a dramatic escalation of restrictions which dealt a blow to the world\u2019s largest mobile gaming market, as Beijing signaled it would continue a campaign to control the expansion of large tech companies.Gaming platforms from Tencent Holdings Ltd. to NetEase Inc. can only offer online gaming to minors from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Fridays, weekends and public holidays, state news agency Xinhua reported, citing a notice by the National Press and Publication Administration. The new rules are a major step-up from a previous restriction set in 2019 of 1.5 daily hours most days.The escalating restrictions on the lucrative gaming business are likely to spook investors who had cautiously returned to Chinese stocks in recent days, exploring bargains after a raft of regulatory probes into areas from online commerce to data security and ride-hailing ignited a trillion-dollar selloff in past months.\u201cThis ruling is the strictest one to date and will essentially wipe out most spending from minors, which we note was already extremely low,\u201d said Daniel Ahmad, an analyst at Niko Partners.Later in the day, Beijing signaled its efforts to rein-in large tech companies will continue. A top-level committee led by President Xi Jinping said that efforts made to prevent the \u201cdisorderly expansion of some platform companies\u201d had been a success while also vowing \u201cmore transparency and predictability\u201d in setting policies, according to Xinhua.Xi also told the meeting that anti-monopoly policies were a requirement for improving China\u2019s economy, Xinhua reported.Netease slid as much as 9.3% in pre-market trading in New York, while Prosus NV, Tencent\u2019s biggest shareholder, fell in Europe.\u201cThree hours per week is too tight. Such a policy will have negative impact on Tencent too,\u201d Steven Leung, an executive director at UOB Kay Hian (Hong Kong) Ltd. said. \u201cI thought regulatory measures would take a break gradually but it\u2019s not stopping at all. It will hurt the nascent tech rebound for sure.\u201dTencent and other companies have said children account for only a fraction of their businesses, especially after recent restrictions. The country\u2019s largest games company has said the revenue from minors yields less than 3% of its gross gaming receipts in China.Other key points in the new rules include:All online games should be linked to a state anti-addiction system, and companies can\u2019t provide services to users without real-name registrationsRegulators will ratchet up checks over how gaming firms carry out restrictions on things like playing time and in-game purchasesRegulators will work with parents, schools and other members of the society to combat youth gaming addictionThe new rules underscore the extent to which Beijing is intent on curbing gaming addiction among youths and pushing its future workforce toward more productive pursuits. Earlier this month, state media published forceful critiques of the industry and at one point labeled games \u201cspiritual opium.\u201d That description was later removed, but share prices plunged out of concern for further restrictions.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysTencent, NetEase and other online games companies in China may experience merely a modest hit to financial performance from the tightening of time restrictions on minors time spent playing games to three hours per week\u2026 though margins could be pinched in the near-term to accelerate the roll-out of compliance measures.\u2013 Matthew Kanterman and Tiffany Tam, analystsTencent, which in 2018 and 2019 grappled with a widespread gaming industry crackdown then focused on myopia among children, is also struggling with a plethora of tightening regulations in areas such as social media, online finance and commerce.It has proactively reduced the number of hours that minors can play its games, but the company was not nearly as restrictive as the government\u2019s new rules. It limited minors to just an hour during weekdays and no more than two hours during vacations and holidays.\u201cSince 2017, Tencent has explored and applied various new technologies and functions for the protection of minors,\u201d Tencent said in a messaged statement. \u201cThat will continue, as Tencent strictly abides by and actively implements the latest requirements from Chinese authorities.\u201d",

            "description": "By FAN FEIFEI | China Daily | Updated: 2021-09-03 09:42QQ Music. [Photo/IC]Termination of exclusive music copyright agreements by Tencent Holdings Ltd, a Chinese tech giant best known for its killer app WeChat and gaming portfolio, will pave the way for long-term healthy development of the music industry, industry experts said on Thursday.A market environment free of dominance or control by big companies can spawn continuous innovation in online music platforms, thereby making possible a variety of personalized services and experiences for consumers, they said.Tencent's ameliorative step is a response to the order of the State Administration for Market Regulation on July 24 that it must give up its exclusive rights to music labels.The regulator's order was in line with the ramping up of efforts by China to tackle unfair competition and monopolistic behavior to restore market order.The regulator also imposed a penalty of 500,000 yuan ($77,400) on the internet giant for its monopolistic behavior.The market regulator said on July 24 Tencent and its affiliates must not engage in exclusive copyright agreements with upstream owners of such rights, while existing agreements must be terminated within 30 days.Tencent and its music arm own over 80 percent of music library resources in China, following its acquisition of China Music Corp in July 2016, which gave Tencent the power to block new entrants and create an unfair business environment, the regulator said.Tencent said in a statement on Tuesday night it had notified the upstream copyright parties involved in such agreements as of Aug 23, and it will continue to cooperate and engage with these parties in a nonexclusive way.Exceptional cases included cooperation periods with independent musicians not exceeding three years, and the exclusive launch period of new songs not exceeding 30 days, Tencent said.\"We have seen Tencent made an announcement to relinquish exclusive music rights, and we expect this to be a sincere decision,\" said Ding Lei, CEO of NetEase, an internet-based provider of a slew of services and content, during an earnings call on Tuesday night.NetEase Cloud Music, an online music streaming service owned by NetEase, is a major competitor of Tencent Music. Ding said the anti-monopoly penalty decision made by the market regulator released a \"very clear, positive and encouraging signal for the entire industry\".Ding called on record companies to open up licensing and jointly create an open, fair, and healthy environment for the industry's development.Tencent's corrective action will promote competition among digital music platforms, and encourage them to innovate, improve services and lower membership fees, finally bringing benefits to consumers, said Yu Zuo, director of the Center for Industrial and Business Organization, which is part of the Dongbei University of Finance and Economics.The antitrust efforts by Chinese regulators have great significance as they can promote the healthy development of the digital music industry, and maintain a fair market environment, Yu said.Dong Yizhi, a lawyer at Shanghai-based law firm Joint-Win Partners, said exclusive music licensing is a very \"controversial\" model because while it can help protect intellectual property rights, it can also hinder innovation and healthy development of the music industry.\"Tencent's abandonment of exclusive rights to music labels will be good news for music creators, whose compositions will be broadcast and disseminated via more platforms,\" Dong said.Now, major online music and entertainment companies should launch more video streaming content and services, as well as expand the diversified application scenarios of music, he said.",

            "description": "Investors are justifiably fleeing Chinese stocks right now. Since late 2020, the Chinese Communist Party has been cracking down on China's tech companies, wiping out more than $1 trillion in market value on fears of increasing regulations.For some, especially private online education companies, the regulations have dramatically affected their business models, wiping out a significant portion of their current revenue.And yet, while there is still lots of uncertainty, Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings (OTC: TCEHY) seems well positioned to weather the near-term turbulence and thrive over the long term, based on its recent earnings release. Now down some 45% from its February highs, it could be a huge opportunity for those willing to take the plunge. Here are five reasons:1. Tencent's business model is diverse, and mostly out of the crosshairs, for nowOutside of its huge investment portfolio, which totaled $224 billion as of the end of June, Tencent's four core businesses are video games, social media, fintech, and cloud computing (with some traditional streaming video and music thrown in).The stock took a step down earlier this month when a Chinese newspaper called video games, its largest segment, \"spiritual opium,\" lashing out at children's addiction to video games. Games are Tencent's largest segment by revenue, and impressively grew 12% last quarter against very difficult comparisons to last year's pandemic-fueled second quarter, so this understandably worried investors.Yet on the conference call with analysts, management pointed out that only 2.6% of gaming revenue came from children 16 or younger, and only 0.3% came from children 12 or younger. In addition, about 25% of gaming revenue came from international markets outside of the Communist Party's control, and international games grew a healthy 37%. So, even if this revenue from children and teens completely went away, it wouldn't affect revenue by that much.Aside from games, other major Chinese tech giants have also been hit by regulations regarding \"forced exclusivity\" on their platforms. On the fintech side, last year's giant Ant Financial IPO was shut down, largely for being too aggressive in lending at the expense of safety.But Tencent's WeChat social platform, which has 1.25 billion users, is already fairly \"open,\" and Tencent has always taken a fairly conservative, deliberate approach to its fintech and lending segment. Thus far, it has largely stayed out of the crosshairs of regulators on those fronts.2. Tencent has always undermonetized its platformsA big overarching theme of the regulatory crackdown is to make a more equitable economy in China, so that wealth does not flow to just a few elites or a few elite companies. For instance, that's why authorities are cracking down on expensive online education companies, which are a burden to families with children, and making sure drivers on food delivery and ride-hailing apps get paid a fair wage. The government doesn't appear to be out to deliberately harm shareholders, but is rather trying to correct rising income inequality. In fact, this is a theme all around the world.While those harsher regulations might affect some companies in Tencent's diverse investment portfolio, its core businesses don't appear as susceptible. That's because the company has always been extremely deliberate in monetizing its platforms, often undermonetizing or not monetizing its products for years.On the broad theme of these new regulations, President Martin Lau had this to say:The government does recognize the importance on the economic side and social side of the internet industry and also the contribution of the industry to global competitiveness. So that's why it does want to foster a long-term healthy environment. ... And we have always been quite self-restrained in terms of monetization. We have run our platforms so that we establish open platforms to support individual enterprises and entities. And we have also, all along the way, quite emphasized social responsibility and emphasized we want to use our tech for good. So given all these factors, right, I would say there will be short-term uncertainties and there are a lot of new regulations that will be coming, but we are pretty confident that we can be compliant. And over the long run, it would actually position the industry for healthy growth, and we'll be a beneficiary of that.Furthermore, Lau said that Tencent has always had a mix of profitable, non-monetized, and loss-making segments, and noted that as of right now, its loss-making segments are \"quite significant.\" Even with these loss-making and undermonetized platforms, Tencent's operating profit margin was 31% last quarter, down from 32.8% in the year-ago quarter, but still significant.3. Tencent could be developing an enterprise software giant right under our nosesThe most compelling long-term growth driver for Tencent could very well be its ascendant cloud computing business. Although the company currently combines its cloud segment with its fintech segment, that \"fintech and business services\" segment grew 40% last quarter, the fastest-growing segment today, and now almost as large as the gaming segment.What really stuck out on the call, however, was that Tencent says it isn't even monetizing a lot of these enterprise software tools such as Tencent Meeting, WeCom, or Tencent Docs, all of which are Chinese versions of incredibly profitable U.S. companies. Lau noted:... in terms of the productivity software side, I think these are services which we don't monetize directly at this point in time, but we believe the category, a lot of value to the customers. And over time, they'll be valuable commercial products as well. But more immediately, right, a lot of these solutions, when they are deployed by enterprise customers, it actually helps us to open the door and as a result, can help us to sell our cloud services as well as our ad services to these companies. That's the immediate benefits. And then over time, if you look at the U.S. market, right, each one of the product that we have actually has got a very successful commercial product in the U.S. For example, Tencent Meeting, the counterpart is Zoom. And if you look at WeCom, it's partly Salesforce, partly Shopify. And Tencent Docs, it's Google Docs and Microsoft Office. ... while we don't charge at this point in time, at the time, we may develop value-added service and for certain customers who want to use these value-added services, there will be some kind of a commercial solution. And looking further into the future, these solutions also have to build an ecosystem of [software-as-a-service] software. So there will be other SaaS software who can actually rely on our productivity, too, and provide their services to the enterprise customers, and we can actually derive some value from there as well. So all in all, we believe that at this point in time, it's a very valuable suite of services from a user-value perspective. Over time, they would help us to generate commercial value as well.Yes, you read that right: Tencent's enterprise software tools are a mix of Zoom Video Communications, Salesforce, Shopify, and Microsoft. These companies have a massive combined market cap and are some of the most exciting, profitable tech stocks today. Yet Tencent is currently giving these tools away for free!It is quite possible that Tencent won't be able to monetize its enterprise software tools to the same extent as these U.S. companies, due to regulations; but then again, even a small amount of monetization could mean lots of revenue and profits relative to Tencent's business today.4. Foreign holdings are significantFourth, no matter what happens inside China, Tencent actually has a fairly significant amount of foreign assets and revenue. As stated before, international revenue now accounts for a quarter of total gaming revenue, and is growing fast.Additionally, a non-trivial part of Tencent's $224 billion investment portfolio consists of large stakes in non-Chinese companies that are doing quite well. For instance, Tencent owns about 4% of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), about 4% of Spotify (NYSE: SPOT), 12% of Snap (NYSE: SNAP) and about 5% of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI). Another huge winner has been its 25% stake in Sea Limited (NYSE: SE), the Southeast Asian super-app that has skyrocketed to a massive $170 billion market cap in its own right. There are several other non-Chinese holdings as well. Still, just the three stakes in Sea, Snap, and Tesla alone combine for a market cap of around $85 billion, or about 17% of Tencent's entire market cap.So while Chinese regulations will hurt Tencent's Chinese segments around the edges at least, there is probably a floor to how much further the stock could fall, just based on international revenue and investments alone.5. Tencent just repurchased shares, a rarity for the companyFinally, an announcement Thursday and Friday might have slipped under the noses of investors. Specifically, Tencent repurchased 180,000 of its own shares on Thursday and 240,000 shares on Friday, the two days after its second-quarter earnings report.While that amount is relatively insignificant relative to the 9.6 billion shares outstanding, Tencent normally doesn't buy any shares back. Instead, the company pays a small dividend, and tends to plow all of its free cash flow back into its investment portfolio.Tencent has announced a lot of investment initiatives recently, and some of its businesses could come under pressure in the near future. So the fact that management was compelled to repurchase some shares, in spite of those other potential uses of cash, is quite telling. With the stock down 45% from highs, it could at least be an indicator that shares might be nearing a bottom.Be cautious, but opportunity loomsDue to the uncertainty in China, it is probably a good idea to have a hard limit on your allocation to Chinese stocks; but if you have no or only a small amount of Chinese exposure, Tencent's stock could be an excellent long-term opportunity today.If you believe Warren Buffett's theory to be greedy when others are fearful, it's hard to imagine more fear in Chinese stocks than there is today. Since it looks like Tencent will be one of the survivors, it could be well worth your attention.10 stocks we like better than Tencent HoldingsWhen our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Spotify, which is based in Sweden, serves 365 million monthly active users (MAUs) across most of the world, but doesn't operate in mainland China.That's because Tencent Music, which hosts 623 million mobile MAUs on its streaming music platform, dominates the mainland Chinese market. Its social entertainment platform, which revolves around its live streaming karaoke app WeSing, hosts an additional 209 million mobile MAUs.Spotify and Tencent Music's markets don't overlap, but they're invested in each other through a share swap deal. However, Spotify has fared much better since its public debut than Tencent Music.Spotify went public via a direct listing in April 2018. Its stock opened at $165.90, far above its reference price of $132, and is currently worth about $220 per share. Tencent Music went public at $13 per share in Dec. 2018, but it's now trading at less than $8 per share. Let's see why Spotify generated stable returns while Tencent Music's stock collapsed, and whether or not it's still a better long-term investment.Spotify's business is stable but unprofitableSpotify's revenue rose 16% to 7.88 billion euros ($9.24 billion) in 2020, then grew 20% year over year to 4.48 billion euros ($5.25 billion) in the first half of 2021. Spotify generates most of its revenue from paid subscriptions, which remained stable throughout the pandemic, but the crisis temporarily throttled its growth in ad-supported revenue.Spotify's MAUs rose 22% year over year to 365 million in the second quarter of 2021. Its paid premium subscribers rose 20% to 165 million. Both growth rates decelerated slightly from the previous quarter.Spotify's net loss widened from 186 million euros ($218 million) in 2019 to 581 million euros ($682 million) in 2020. But in the first half of 2021, its net loss narrowed from 355 million euros ($416 million) to 84 million euros ($99 million) as its advertising business recovered, it benefited from a revenue shift from lower-margin licensed music toward higher-margin podcasts, and reined in its marketing expenses.For the full year, Spotify expects its total MAUs to grow 16%-18%, and for its number of premium subscribers to rise 14%-17%.Spotify believes its full-year revenue should rise 18%-23%, but also for its operating losses in the second half to wipe out its slim operating profit of 26 million euros ($30 million) in the first half of the year. In short, Spotify's growth should remain stable, but it won't turn profitable anytime soon.Tencent Music's business is profitable but unstableWhen Tencent Music went public, some investors considered it to be a better streaming music stock than Spotify because it was firmly profitable.Tencent Music stayed in the black by subsidizing its online music platform with its social entertainment platform. Simply put, it let its live streaming and karaoke fans purchase virtual gifts for their favorite entertainers, and used that higher-margin revenue to offset its higher music licensing costs.Unfortunately, its social entertainment segment has posted year-over-year declines in mobile MAUs for five consecutive quarters, while its number of paying users has fallen for three straight quarters. That ugly slowdown can be attributed to competition from short video apps like ByteDance's Douyin (known as TikTok overseas) and other live streaming platforms.That slowdown pressured Tencent Music to aggressively convert the online music segment's free users to paid ones. That strategy consistently boosted the platform's paid users, but it's also been losing mobile MAUs over the past five quarters, and its average revenue per paying user remains stagnant.Tencent's revenue rose 34% to 25.43 billion yuan ($3.65 billion) in 2019, then grew 15% to 29.15 billion yuan ($4.47 billion) in 2020. Its revenue rose 19% year over year to 15.83 billion yuan ($2.45 billion) in the first half of 2021 as it gained more paying online music subscribers.Its adjusted earnings grew 18% in 2019, rose 1% in 2020, and only increased another 1% year-over-year in the first half of 2021. Analysts expect its revenue to rise 11% this year, but for its earnings to drop 21% as it loses more higher-margin social entertainment users and surrenders its exclusive music licensing rights to appease China's antitrust regulators.The valuations and verdictSpotify trades at about four times trailing 12-month (TTM) sales, while Tencent Music trades at less than 7.3 times sales. Both stocks look cheap, but Tencent Music deserves to trade at a low valuation because its profit engine has stalled out and its loss of exclusive licensing music rights will narrow its competitive moat. Meanwhile, Spotify's shift toward higher-margin podcasts -- which generate more ad revenue and reduce its dependence on costly music licensing agreements -- could pay off.I'm not a big fan of either stock right now. But if I had to choose one over the other, I'd stick with Spotify, which should remain the world's largest paid streaming music platform for the foreseeable future.",

            "description": "Cora, a Brazilian digital lender to small-and-medium-sized businesses, has raised $116 million in a Series B round led by Greenoaks Capital.This is a large Series B by any standards, but particularly so for a Latin American startup. It\u2019s also notable that S\u00e3o Paulo-based Cora only raised its $26.7 million Series A round \u2014 led by Silicon Valley VC firm Ribbit Capital \u2014 in early April. The startup has now raised a total of $152.7 million since its 2019 inception.The company wasn\u2019t actively in the market, according to CEO and co-founder Igor Senra, but was approached by existing backer Greenoaks and other investors.In fact, Tiger Global and Tencent are first-time backers in Cora with this latest round, joining existing investors Greenoaks, Kaszek, QED and Ribbit Capital.\u201cGreenoaks came to us and said they were very impressed, and ready to lead our Series B,\u201d Senra said. \u201cTheir main goal was they didn\u2019t want us to spend time on fundraising, but instead stay focused on building the company.\u201dThe pattern is similar to previous ones for Cora, which saw existing backers lead its previous rounds as well, which the company sees as a \u201cstrong signal that everything is going in the right direction.\u201d The company declined to comment on valuation.Last year, Cora got its license approved from the Central Bank of Brazil, making it a 403 bank. The fintech then launched its product in October 2020 and today offers a checking account combined with a software layer that aims to help SMBs manage their financials. It is currently in beta with a limited group of users for a corporate credit card.\u201cCredit limits in general increase as customers use their accounts to receive money and pay their expenses,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see this product evolving over time to solve all the financial needs that a small business owner could have.\u201dSince its launch last October, Cora has been growing its customers 40% per month, according to Senra. During that same period, the company has seen its transaction value/revenue grow by nearly 60% monthly. Today, the startup has more than 120,000 customers.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see that volume is growing even higher than our customer base,\u201d Senra told TechCrunch. \u201cOur business must gain trust in order to gain volume. Once our customer base believes we are doing a good job serving them, the way to demonstrate that is to give us more volume.\u201dThe company says it is not yet profitable because it\u2019s focused on growth.\u201cBut we already have a positive unit economics per customer,\u201d Senra added.Like a number of other fintechs, Cora\u2019s model is that most of its offerings are free for its customers but it mostly makes money off of interchange fees.For now, the company is focused on growing in Brazil, which is large and complex enough, Senra noted. It may consider going abroad in three to four years, he said.Currently, Cora has 150 employees, up from 68 at the end of last year and 40 a year ago. About 130 of its employees are \u201cpartners\u201d in the company, Senra said.Looking ahead, the startup plans to use its new capital toward product development, growth, operations and building out a credit offering. It is using the data it is generating \u201cto provide way better credit\u201d for its customers, Senra said, starting with credit cards, then receivables and other kinds of credit such as emergency credit or credit for investments.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to deeply understand our customers\u2019 needs and trying to create products they love,\u201d Senra told TechCrunch. \u201cWe consider ourselves the opposite of traditional banks, which are usually not good at taking care of their customers.\u201dFor now, Cora is focused on the B2B service providers, but Senra expects that by the beginning of next year, it can start exploring \u201cother segments\u201d such as other kinds of SMBs.\u201cThere is a total addressable market of 5 million companies, so there is a lot of room to grow,\u201d he added. \u201cBut we are pushing ourselves to expand other verticals.\u201dFor its part, Patrick Backhouse of Greenoaks Capital believes that Brazil has an \u201cenormous\u201d SME economy that has historically been \u201cunderserved by incumbent banks.\u201d\u201cExisting services are expensive and inefficient, creating opportunities for technology enabled service providers to offer better and cheaper services,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe Cora is a once in a generation company building efficient digital finance tools for small businesses. Since investing in the company\u2019s Series A, we\u2019ve seen accelerated momentum and proof that this is an enormous addressable market.\u201d",

            "description": "Chinese companies listed in the United States are slated to have their longest losing streak in more than 10 years as Beijing continues its clampdown.Chinese companies listed in the U.S. are on pace for their longest losing streak in more than a decade after Beijing intensified its regulatory clampdown across various industries this week.American depositary receipts for tech giants have racked up losses with Tencent Holdings Ltd., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., and Nio Inc., erasing more than 7% each this week. The declines have sent the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index to lose 7.7% of its value this week, wrapping up two months of declines.Chinese state media called for tougher oversight to protect consumers, hurting liquor makers, cosmetics firms and online pharmacies on Friday. The Hang Seng Index plunged to enter a technical bear market as regulatory crackdowns spread across industries. This comes after policymakers in China released a fresh round of proposed regulations to further ensure the rights of drivers who work for online companies and to step up oversight of the live streaming industry.\u201cThis drawdown we\u2019re seeing in China is absolutely business as usual for investing in Chinese equities,\u201d according to Gabriela Santos, global market strategist at JP Morgan Chase & Co. \u201cEvery year you should expect at 20% correction and every three years or so you tend to have an over 30% correction,\u201d she said in a Bloomberg TV interview Friday.The iShares China Large-Cap ETF (FXI), which houses both Alibaba and Tencent as well as other favorites of U.S. investors, fell 0.9%. The ETF has wiped out roughly 30% of its value from a February peak and is on track to close at the lowest since May 2020.The overnight news out of China remains \u201cpersistently negative,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.In the span of just six months the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index \u2014 which tracks 98 firms listed in the U.S. that conduct a majority of their business in China \u2014 has plunged about 51%. It gained 2.2% Friday as China\u2019s securities regulators vowed to create conditions to push for cooperation with the U.S. on companies\u2019 audit and supervision.ETF ExitsIn recent days investors have started to exit U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds that focus on Chinese stocks, with the $4.7 billion KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF seeing four straight sessions of outflows. However, those outflows amount to only $78 million, accounting for a small fraction of the $3.8 billion in inflows the fund has seen this year.In fact, across more than 40 non-leveraged U.S.-listed equity ETFs that are China focused, net inflows for the year are close to passing the $8 billion mark, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The majority of that has come since early March when regulators in Beijing fined tech giants including Tencent and Baidu Inc. for past acquisitions and investments.The continued inflow of money into ETFs is likely a result of some investors trying to time the end of the selloff, analysts said.\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely a sign that people are bottom calling here, said Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart. \u201cJust trying to catch some sort of rebound but that obliviously hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d he added.One possible catalyst that could turn the tide for shares is a rush of earnings over the next two weeks from some of the hardest hit stocks. Large-cap names including JD.com Inc., Pinduoduo Inc. and NetEase Inc. will all release second-quarter results which will be closely watched for any indication that the regulatory scrutiny is having an impact on their bottom lines.For JPMorgan\u2019s Santos, investors shouldn\u2019t pull out of the local market. \u201cWe fundamentally disagree with the thesis that China is now uninvestable,\u201d she said. \u201cTo me, one of the most import themes of the next decade is the rise of China in portfolios.\u201d",

            "description": "Investors are justifiably fleeing Chinese stocks right now. Since late 2020, the Chinese Communist Party has been cracking down on China's tech companies, wiping out more than $1 trillion in market value on fears of increasing regulations.For some, especially private online education companies, the regulations have dramatically affected their business models, wiping out a significant portion of their current revenue.And yet, while there is still lots of uncertainty, Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings (TCEHY -0.22%) seems well positioned to weather the near-term turbulence and thrive over the long term, based on its recent earnings release. Now down some 45% from its February highs, it could be a huge opportunity for those willing to take the plunge. Here are five reasons:1. Tencent's business model is diverse, and mostly out of the crosshairs, for nowOutside of its huge investment portfolio, which totaled $224 billion as of the end of June, Tencent's four core businesses are video games, social media, fintech, and cloud computing (with some traditional streaming video and music thrown in).The stock took a step down earlier this month when a Chinese newspaper called video games, its largest segment, \"spiritual opium,\" lashing out at children's addiction to video games. Games are Tencent's largest segment by revenue, and impressively grew 12% last quarter against very difficult comparisons to last year's pandemic-fueled second quarter, so this understandably worried investors.Yet on the conference call with analysts, management pointed out that only 2.6% of gaming revenue came from children 16 or younger, and only 0.3% came from children 12 or younger. In addition, about 25% of gaming revenue came from international markets outside of the Communist Party's control, and international games grew a healthy 37%. So, even if this revenue from children and teens completely went away, it wouldn't affect revenue by that much.Aside from games, other major Chinese tech giants have also been hit by regulations regarding \"forced exclusivity\" on their platforms. On the fintech side, last year's giant Ant Financial IPO was shut down, largely for being too aggressive in lending at the expense of safety.But Tencent's WeChat social platform, which has 1.25 billion users, is already fairly \"open,\" and Tencent has always taken a fairly conservative, deliberate approach to its fintech and lending segment. Thus far, it has largely stayed out of the crosshairs of regulators on those fronts.2. Tencent has always undermonetized its platformsA big overarching theme of the regulatory crackdown is to make a more equitable economy in China, so that wealth does not flow to just a few elites or a few elite companies. For instance, that's why authorities are cracking down on expensive online education companies, which are a burden to families with children, and making sure drivers on food delivery and ride-hailing apps get paid a fair wage. The government doesn't appear to be out to deliberately harm shareholders, but is rather trying to correct rising income inequality. In fact, this is a theme all around the world.While those harsher regulations might affect some companies in Tencent's diverse investment portfolio, its core businesses don't appear as susceptible. That's because the company has always been extremely deliberate in monetizing its platforms, often undermonetizing or not monetizing its products for years.On the broad theme of these new regulations, President Martin Lau had this to say:The government does recognize the importance on the economic side and social side of the internet industry and also the contribution of the industry to global competitiveness. So that's why it does want to foster a long-term healthy environment. ... And we have always been quite self-restrained in terms of monetization. We have run our platforms so that we establish open platforms to support individual enterprises and entities. And we have also, all along the way, quite emphasized social responsibility and emphasized we want to use our tech for good. So given all these factors, right, I would say there will be short-term uncertainties and there are a lot of new regulations that will be coming, but we are pretty confident that we can be compliant. And over the long run, it would actually position the industry for healthy growth, and we'll be a beneficiary of that.Furthermore, Lau said that Tencent has always had a mix of profitable, non-monetized, and loss-making segments, and noted that as of right now, its loss-making segments are \"quite significant.\" Even with these loss-making and undermonetized platforms, Tencent's operating profit margin was 31% last quarter, down from 32.8% in the year-ago quarter, but still significant.3. Tencent could be developing an enterprise software giant right under our nosesThe most compelling long-term growth driver for Tencent could very well be its ascendant cloud computing business. Although the company currently combines its cloud segment with its fintech segment, that \"fintech and business services\" segment grew 40% last quarter, the fastest-growing segment today, and now almost as large as the gaming segment.What really stuck out on the call, however, was that Tencent says it isn't even monetizing a lot of these enterprise software tools such as Tencent Meeting, WeCom, or Tencent Docs, all of which are Chinese versions of incredibly profitable U.S. companies. Lau noted:... in terms of the productivity software side, I think these are services which we don't monetize directly at this point in time, but we believe the category, a lot of value to the customers. And over time, they'll be valuable commercial products as well. But more immediately, right, a lot of these solutions, when they are deployed by enterprise customers, it actually helps us to open the door and as a result, can help us to sell our cloud services as well as our ad services to these companies. That's the immediate benefits. And then over time, if you look at the U.S. market, right, each one of the product that we have actually has got a very successful commercial product in the U.S. For example, Tencent Meeting, the counterpart is Zoom. And if you look at WeCom, it's partly Salesforce, partly Shopify. And Tencent Docs, it's Google Docs and Microsoft Office. ... while we don't charge at this point in time, at the time, we may develop value-added service and for certain customers who want to use these value-added services, there will be some kind of a commercial solution. And looking further into the future, these solutions also have to build an ecosystem of [software-as-a-service] software. So there will be other SaaS software who can actually rely on our productivity, too, and provide their services to the enterprise customers, and we can actually derive some value from there as well. So all in all, we believe that at this point in time, it's a very valuable suite of services from a user-value perspective. Over time, they would help us to generate commercial value as well.Yes, you read that right: Tencent's enterprise software tools are a mix of Zoom Video Communications, Salesforce, Shopify, and Microsoft. These companies have a massive combined market cap and are some of the most exciting, profitable tech stocks today. Yet Tencent is currently giving these tools away for free!It is quite possible that Tencent won't be able to monetize its enterprise software tools to the same extent as these U.S. companies, due to regulations; but then again, even a small amount of monetization could mean lots of revenue and profits relative to Tencent's business today.4. Foreign holdings are significantFourth, no matter what happens inside China, Tencent actually has a fairly significant amount of foreign assets and revenue. As stated before, international revenue now accounts for a quarter of total gaming revenue, and is growing fast.Additionally, a non-trivial part of Tencent's $224 billion investment portfolio consists of large stakes in non-Chinese companies that are doing quite well. For instance, Tencent owns about 4% of Tesla (TSLA 4.51%), about 4% of Spotify (SPOT -0.23%), 12% of Snap (SNAP 1.26%) and about 5% of Activision Blizzard (ATVI). Another huge winner has been its 25% stake in Sea Limited (SE 6.00%), the Southeast Asian super-app that has skyrocketed to a massive $170 billion market cap in its own right. There are several other non-Chinese holdings as well. Still, just the three stakes in Sea, Snap, and Tesla alone combine for a market cap of around $85 billion, or about 17% of Tencent's entire market cap.So while Chinese regulations will hurt Tencent's Chinese segments around the edges at least, there is probably a floor to how much further the stock could fall, just based on international revenue and investments alone.5. Tencent just repurchased shares, a rarity for the companyFinally, an announcement Thursday and Friday might have slipped under the noses of investors. Specifically, Tencent repurchased 180,000 of its own shares on Thursday and 240,000 shares on Friday, the two days after its second-quarter earnings report.While that amount is relatively insignificant relative to the 9.6 billion shares outstanding, Tencent normally doesn't buy any shares back. Instead, the company pays a small dividend, and tends to plow all of its free cash flow back into its investment portfolio.Tencent has announced a lot of investment initiatives recently, and some of its businesses could come under pressure in the near future. So the fact that management was compelled to repurchase some shares, in spite of those other potential uses of cash, is quite telling. With the stock down 45% from highs, it could at least be an indicator that shares might be nearing a bottom.Be cautious, but opportunity loomsDue to the uncertainty in China, it is probably a good idea to have a hard limit on your allocation to Chinese stocks; but if you have no or only a small amount of Chinese exposure, Tencent's stock could be an excellent long-term opportunity today.If you believe Warren Buffett's theory to be greedy when others are fearful, it's hard to imagine more fear in Chinese stocks than there is today. Since it looks like Tencent will be one of the survivors, it could be well worth your attention.",

Aly Song | ReutersGUANGZHOU, China \u2014 Tencent warned more regulations will likely come for the internet sector in China but said the company is \"confident\" it can be compliant. The comments come after the Chinese technology giant beat market expectations to post a 29% rise in second-quarter profit, and as Beijing intensifies its regulatory scrutiny of the country's internet companies. \"We should expect ... in the near future, more regulations should be coming,\" Martin Lau, president of Tencent, said during an earnings call on Wednesday. Lau said that internet regulation is a \"global trend\" but China is ahead of Europe and the U.S. in terms of the \"execution of a more structural regulation framework.\"\"I think this should be expected because the regulation has been actually quite loose over an industry like the internet, considering it's size and the importance,\" he added. The Tencent president said regulators are focused on \"rectifying industry misbehaviors\" and emphasizing social responsibility. But ultimately the goal is \"long-term sustainable development of the internet industry,\" according to Lau. \"The government does recognize the importance on the economic side and social side of the internet industry and also the contribution of the industry to global competitiveness,\" Lau said.I would say there will be short-term uncertainties and there are a lot of new regulations that will be coming, but we are pretty confident that we can be compliant. Martin Lau president, TencentVarious Chinese regulators have come out with new rules for the internet sector over the past few months from anti-trust to data regulation. The speed and scope of the actions has wiped billions of dollars worth of value from China's internet companies. Tencent's stock is down 23% this year. Still, the gaming giant, which has faced regulatory scrutiny in the past, said it will be able to comply. \"I would say there will be short-term uncertainties and there are a lot of new regulations that will be coming, but we are pretty confident that we can be compliant,\" Lau said.Gaming rules in focus",

            "description": "Martin Lau, president and executive director of China\u2019s tech and entertainment industry leader Tencent, on Wednesday explained the positive outcome from the maelstrom of new regulation that the Chinese government is currently imposing on the internet.In less than a year, regulators from multiple departments and ministries have besieged the country\u2019s leading private sector companies. Some have been very publicly been cut down to size with fines, another saw its IPO canceled, others have endured pressure and criticism from state media. Many across tech and entertainment have been told that their current business practices are detrimental to society and that they will be reformed.Earlier Wednesday, Tencent was one of 40 companies told that its app was misusing private data. The app in question was Weixin (aka WeChat), installed on over a billion phones in China and the linchpin of Tencent\u2019s entire games, music, video, social media and micro finance ecosystem.Government apparatchiks have drawn red lines around mergers and acquisitions, determined how firms compete with each other, and introduced national security concerns into how they handle data. Communist Party officials have been parachuted onto the board of directors of at least two social media firms.As a result of the changes \u2014 and fears of what may happen next \u2014 investors have fled, and hundreds of billions of dollars of corporate value has been wiped out.Lau, a Stanford University and McKinsey consulting alumnus, spoke on a conference call after Tencent announced its financial results for the first six months of the year. Asked by an investment analyst which recent regulatory initiative had been the most surprising, Lau started small and cited the government\u2019s out-of-the blue decision to effectively ban private coaching.\u201c[The ruling on] after-school tutoring is affecting a pretty big advertising group. We saw part of the impact in the quarter and will see the full impact over the current quarter. Over time we will be able to place inventory with other advertisers,\u201d he said.Then, realizing that he was going to be peppered with further questions on the same subject throughout the call, Lau went for a more macro-economic portrayal. His analysis was carefully mixed with a touch of special pleading and a large slice of humble pie.\u201cRegulation of the internet is a global phenomenon. It is not just in China. It is also happening in the U.S. and Europe. China is a bit ahead in terms of the more structural regulation framework. This should be expected because (past) regulation has been quite loose over an industry like the internet, considering its size and importance.\u201cThe regulators are very focused on identifying and rectifying industry failures. And also establishing regulations that emphasize compliance and social responsibility as well as improper behavior. We should expect that in the future more regulations will be coming.\u201cFrom our understanding, the government actually wants to foster a long-term sustainable development of the internet industry. The government does recognize the importance on the economic side and the social side of the internet industry and also the contribution of the industry to (China\u2019s) global competitiveness. It does want to foster a long-term healthier environment.\u201cOur attitude during this wave of regulation: we want to embrace this environment fully. And we want to establish ourselves as fully compliant.\u201cWe feel that this is actually going to be good for us and for the entire industry in the long run.\u201cAnd on a relative basis we felt quite well positioned to embrace the regulatory environment because we have been fully-compliant with all regulations. That has always been our operating philosophy. Our strategy has always been about trying to create value for users. We have always been quite self-restrained in terms of monetization. We have run our platforms to support individual enterprises and along the way have always emphasized social responsibility. We want to use our tech for good.\u201cGiven all these factors, there will be short-term uncertainties. And there will be a lot of regulations coming. But we are pretty certain that we can be compliant and over the long run these will actually position the industry for healthy growth \u2013 and we will be the beneficiary of that.\u201d",

Arguably its most high-profile casualty was the Premier League after English soccer\u2019s top-flight confirmed last September the termination of the pair\u2019s deal, cutting short the UK\u00a3523 million (US$724 million) contract two years early. At the time, British media reports suggested that PP Sports had not paid a UK\u00a3160 million (US$222 million) instalment for the 2019/20 season.Tencent\u2019s coverage of Uefa club competitions will be available across the company\u2019s various platforms, including Tencent Sports, WeChat and Aurora TV.For iQiyi, the agreement bolsters its soccer offering in China. Last month, the platform landed a deal with the Premier League to become the competition\u2019s exclusive digital broadcast partner in China until the end of the 2024/25 season.

The article also called for further restrictions on the industry in order to prevent addiction and other negative impacts on children. The article was deleted a few hours after publication but has since been re-published with a new headline and references to \"opium\" removed. Tencent shares closed around 6% lower, while NetEase closed down almost 8% in Hong Kong, with both companies clawing back some earlier losses. Tencent is one of the world's largest gaming companies responsible for high-profile games like \"Honor of Kings.\" NetEase declined to comment. Tencent was not immediately available for comment. The article, by Economic Information Daily, a Chinese state-run publication that's affiliated to the official Xinhua newspaper, said that online gaming addiction among children is \"widespread\" and could negatively impact their growth.The article said that in 2020, more than half China's children were nearsighted and online games affects their education. The sentiment in the article is not that new. For a long time, the Chinese government has been concerned about the impact of video games on minors. In 2018, Beijing froze new game approvals over concerns that gaming was impacting youngsters' eyesight. In China, online games require approvals from the regulators. In 2019, China brought in rules that banned those under 18 years from playing online games between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. and restricted the amount of time they could play.watch now\"The article brought attention to gaming addiction among minors. It is reminiscent of older articles where video games were compared to digital heroin,\" said Daniel Ahmad, senior analyst at Niko Partners. \"The timing of the article has raised concern among investors given the recent crackdown on tech companies and the education/tutoring sector.\"Tencent announces new measuresThe article also called for more control over the amount of time children are playing games for and review content of games more stringently to reduce the amount of \"improper\" information shown to minors. \"For the next step, there should be stricter controls over the amount of time minors play online games. It should be reduced by large amount from current level,\" the article said, according to a CNBC translation. Both NetEase and Tencent have introduced measures to protect young players including real-name registrations to play games. Last month, Tencent introduced a facial recognition feature on smartphones to verify that the gamer is an adult. But after the publication of the article on Tuesday, Tencent announced further gaming restrictions It will reduce the amount of time those under 18 years old can play the company's games on non-holiday days from 90 minutes to one hour and on holidays from 3 hours to 2 hours.",

Ke was the owner of 36.99 percent of HengTen at the end of 2020; he attained his current stake with his share purchase from Evergrande in June. A disclosure form indicated that Ke paid HK$6 a share at the time, while Evergrande\u2019s shares in the latest transactions are changing hands for HK$3.20.The nearly $1 billion in cash-outs by Evergrande occur amid more grumblings from the embattled developer\u2019s suppliers. Bloomberg reported last Friday that Huaibei Mining Holdings had filed a lawsuit against Evergrande in Anhui province, alleging that a subsidiary of the company missed payments.Huaibei Mining is demanding RMB 401 million ($62 million) for fees and breach of contract, while another company, Peace Tree Wood, said Evergrande has missed payments on RMB 2 million in commercial bills.Evergrande issued a statement on Friday seeking to clarify that \u201cthe lawsuit involves a construction contract dispute where the parties are disputing over whether payment under the contract is due and have resolved to settle the dispute through litigation\u201d.The developer said that its subsidiary, Evergrande Real Estate Group Co Ltd, is not a party to the contract, that the litigation has no legal and contractual basis, and that the unit has filed an objection in court.Taming the SheetAside from the HengTen stake sale, Evergrande in June shed a nearly $400 million interest in smaller developer Calxon. Also that month, the group made a show of repaying a $1.47 billion offshore bond a week ahead of its due date as a sign of commitment to taming its balance sheet.Evergrande maintained its position as China\u2019s top developer in 2020, with sales growing even more quickly during the pandemic, but profits slid by more than a quarter.After frightening the Greater China financial industry with a plea for financial aid last year, the group joined the shift towards fiscal prudence in 2020.According to an annual financial statement released at the end of March, Evergrande reduced its total debt by 14 percent in the second half of last year to RMB 717 billion as of 31 December. By the end of March, those obligations had been shrunk still further to RMB 674 billion.The company has said it will further tame its balance sheet in the years to come, with a goal of bringing total debt down to RMB 350 billion by mid-2023.",

            "description": "Since the beginning of the year, its share price has gone from a high of HK$767 (US$98.70) in January to HK$446 by market close on August 3, a drop of almost 42 per cent, after a now-deleted article from state-owned media condemned video games as \u201cspiritual opium\u201d.Starting in July, the Shenzhen-based company has seen a merger deal blocked, been ordered to end its exclusive music licencing deals with global record labels, and suspended new user registrations on its super app, WeChat.At the beginning of 2021, the trillion-dollar club almost added a new member: Tencent Holdings . However, the social media and gaming giant saw its momentum flag as China\u2019s government ramped up the pressure on the country\u2019s entire technology sector.Here is a fresh look at how Tencent got to where it is today and the challenges it faces.How did Tencent begin?It all began in 1998 in a small office in Huaqiangbei, a district in China\u2019s southern tech hub of Shenzhen known for its sprawling electronics markets.The country\u2019s internet industry was just starting to take off. The number of web users had ballooned to more than 2 million from a paltry 1,600 just four years earlier.Pony Ma Huateng, a 27-year-old software engineer, spotted an opportunity in the booming space. He quit his job at China Motion Telecom and founded Tencent with a group of fellow alumni from Shenzhen University.The start-up\u2019s first product was OICQ, one of several Chinese instant messaging programmes similar to Israel\u2019s then-popular ICQ.After a legal complaint from AOL, which had acquired ICQ the previous year, Tencent renamed its programme QQ in 2000. It quickly gained popularity among the country\u2019s early internet adopters who were looking for a reliable way to connect and communicate.QQ\u2019s logo is a scarf-wearing penguin, which earned Tencent its Chinese internet nickname \u201cpenguin factory\u201d. Photo: BloombergBuilding on its reputation as a relatively stable service, QQ drew a million users within nine months, according to Tencent\u2019s authorised biography published in 2017.The fast-growing user base enabled Tencent to explore new revenue streams.One early attempt was a virtual currency called QQ Coin. Introduced in 2000, it allowed users to pay for features such as QQ Show, which lets them customise their avatars and account names.These paid services later morphed into a multi-tiered membership system that gave users different levels of privilege according to how much money they were willing to shell out.Besides being an early digital currency laboratory, QQ was also where Tencent laid the first brick of its gaming empire. In 2004, the year the company went public in Hong Kong, Tencent launched QQ Games and gave some of the messenger\u2019s 200 million users their first taste of online games.When did WeChat come into the picture?By the mid-2000s, QQ had already propelled Tencent into a leading social messaging giant, but the company had no time to rest on its laurels. China was starting to witness another seismic shift on the internet: smartphones.More people were going online using mobile devices rather than personal computers, which made it clear that Tencent had to evolve.The first version of WeChat in 2011 was simple: the app allowed users to exchange text messages and photos. Later on, it added voice messages \u2013 short audio clips that essentially allowed users to turn their smartphones into walkie-talkies \u2013 which was especially popular among older users who found typing out Chinese characters too cumbersome.Today, WeChat has become a lot more than that. It has turned into a super app.One of its star features is mini-programs , which are tiny apps that run almost instantly inside WeChat. Along with the app\u2019s digital payment function, they allow users to do many things without leaving the app.Users can read the news, play games, share photos and music, order food, hail a taxi and pay bills \u2013 all within the universe of WeChat.It is no exaggeration to say that over a decade, WeChat has profoundly influenced how Chinese people interact with each other in the online world.The app, which celebrated its 10th anniversary year, currently counts more than 1.2 billion monthly active users, most of them in mainland China.How else does Tencent make money?While Tencent has its roots in social media, the video games business is its primary source of revenue and supports the company\u2018s global expansion.Online games make up roughly one-third of Tencent\u2019s total revenue , making it the world\u2019s biggest gaming business. Its self-developed blockbuster Honour of Kings has long been the world\u2019s most lucrative mobile game, a title it retained as of June, according to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.Its players spent US$277 million in that month alone, with 96 per cent of the revenue coming from China.Outside its home market, Tencent is an investor in a string of gaming titans. It owns California-based Riot Games, the developer behind the wildly popular League of Legends, and holds a majority stake in Finland\u2019s Supercell, the creator of Clash of Clans.It also has stakes in Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft, Epic Games and Bluehole, the developer of PlayerUnknown\u2018s Battlegrounds.Although gaming is a key part of its operations, Tencent has expanded its business interests through the years. Its portfolio now covers more than 800 firms at home and abroad as of last January.The company\u2019s investments include artificial intelligence, retail, education, financial technology and corporate services. It has stakes in familiar Western names including Tesla, Snapchat, Spotify and Universal Music Group.At home, Tencent is also a heavyweight in streaming video and music services. Tencent Video is one of China\u2019s top video-streaming sites, along with Baidu-backed iQiyi.Tencent Music, which was spun off and went public in New York in 2018, runs China\u2019s three most popular music-streaming apps.Moving beyond consumer businesses, Tencent has recently marched into the enterprise market. It has made a big push into cloud computing and the industrial Internet of Things, as China pursues the digital transformation of traditional industries.The Tencent building in Shenzhen\u2019s Nanshan district. Photo: XinhuaWhat is the outlook for Tencent amid challenges at home and US-China tensions?Despite its strengths and continuing growth prospects, Tencent is one of many Chinese tech companies bearing the brunt of Beijing\u2019s campaign to rein in the industryAlibaba Group Holding, the owner of the South China Morning Post, was fined 18.2 billion yuan (US$2.8 billion) in April for monopolistic practices including \u201cpicking one from two\u201d, which forced online merchants to choose just one distribution channel.In July, regulators ordered Tencent to relinquish its exclusive music licencing deals with global record labels and that same month blocked a long-awaited merger deal that would have combined the country\u2019s two largest video game live-streaming platforms.Indeed, there are increasing signs that China\u2019s Big Tech, long jealous kings of their respective domains, may now start working togetherIn March, Alibaba attempted to launch its bargain e-commerce platform Taobao Deals as a mini program on WeChat.In July, Alibaba and Tencent, along with 31 other China Big Tech firms, signed a \u201cself-discipline\u201d antitrust convention to promote competition and to protect user rights.Starting with Didi Chuxing \u2019s surprise cybersecurity review after it \u201c forced its way \u201d to a New York listing in late June, the entire tech industry is taking note.In July, WeChat, the most-used app in China, said it had suspended new user registrations pending a \u201csecurity upgrade\u201d to comply with \u201crelevant laws and regulations\u201d. Existing users of Weixin have not been affected, and people outside mainland China, including Hong Kong, were still able to register new accounts on the international version called WeChat.Outside China, Tencent can breathe a little easier.Under the administration of the former US president Donald Trump, WeChat was a prime target in his escalating tech war with China. However, after being elected, President Joe Biden has slowly moderated some of his predecessor\u2019s policies and actions against Chinese tech companies.In July, the US Department of Justice said in a legal filing that the case against the Chinese-owned video-sharing app \u201cis now moot\u201d and that the government has voluntarily dismissed the cases.",

            "description": "Tencent Holdings Ltd. led a stocks rout after Chinese state media decried the \u201cspiritual opium\u201d of games, prompting the company to broach a ban for kids and triggering fears Beijing will set its sights next on the world\u2019s largest gaming arena.China\u2019s most valuable corporation joined rivals from NetEase Inc. to Nexon Co. in a gaming selloff after an outlet run by the Xinhua News Agency published a blistering critique of their industry. The Economic Information Daily cited a student as saying some schoolmates played Tencent\u2019s Honor of Kings\u2014one of its most popular titles\u2014eight hours a day and called for stricter controls over time spent. The online link to the post was removed hours later without explanation, though the story remains in the print version.Tencent then followed up with a pledge to further limit play time for minors\u2014to just an hour during weekdays and no more than two hours during vacations and holidays. That\u2019s a step up from restrictions imposed by China\u2019s gaming watchdog in 2019. It also plans to forbid in-game purchases for under 12-year-olds, starting with its signature title. And more dramatically, the company broached the possibility of the industry banning games altogether for those under the age of 12, without elaborating.Tuesday\u2019s rapid-fire developments stoked fears Beijing will next train its attention on an arena that\u2019s pivotal to the bottom line of media giants from Tencent to Apple Inc. and Activision Blizzard Inc. They come after a couple of tumultuous weeks for global investors that at one point wiped out more than $1 trillion of market value. Since July, the government has effectively frozen overseas listings to safeguard data security in the wake of Didi Global Inc.\u2019s controversial $4.4 billion IPO, and ordered a swath of after-school tutoring businesses to go non-profit. Those actions demonstrated Beijing\u2019s resolve to go after private enterprises to address social inequities, seize control of data it deems crucial to the economy and stability, and rein in powerful interests.\u201cChina, in this regard, is in uncharted waters and needs to tread the path carefully,\u201d said Aidan Yao, Senior Emerging Asia Economist of AXA Investment Managers. \u201cA lot of the recent market volatility is, in my view, a result of investors not knowing what Beijing is up to, that inadvertently erodes confidence in investing in this market. The latter is a key risk that needs to be carefully managed.\u201dTencent dived as much as 11% Tuesday before recouping some of those losses to end 6% lower. Shares in Tencent backers Naspers Ltd. and Prosus NV slid, while Nintendo Co. and Capcom Co. fell alongside Nexon in Tokyo. Many foreign game developers have a licensing deal with Tencent to get their titles into China.Beijing\u2019s campaign to rein in its giant internet industry is entering its 10th month, a roller-coaster ordeal that\u2019s prompting nervous investors to ponder the longer-term ramifications of a crackdown on firms from Jack Ma\u2019s Ant Group Co. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Tencent-backed food delivery giant Meituan and Didi. Tencent has now shed about $400 billion of its market value since a January peak.\u201cThe word choice of spiritual opium is especially harsh, it would be surprising if the regulators won\u2019t do anything about this,\u201d said Ke Yan, a Singapore-based analyst with DZT Research.China\u2019s social media leader has run afoul of regulators in the past, most notably in 2018 when watchdog agencies clamped down on gaming addiction and temporarily suspended monetization licenses, walloping Tencent\u2019s main business. Terms likening games to narcotics have in fact been employed in Chinese media in the past to call attention to the prevalence of gaming among youths, tracing back to the era of PC gaming in cybercafes.In response, Tencent has restricted playing time for minors and imposed other measures to try and curb addiction. Just last month, it installed facial recognition systems for certain games to prevent kids from using their parents\u2019 IDs to buy in-game items. In the fourth quarter of 2020, minors aged under 18 accounted for just 6% of the company\u2019s Chinese online gaming gross receipts.\u201cNo industry or sport should prosper by eradicating an entire generation,\u201d Tuesday\u2019s article said, citing an academic at a state-backed institution.\u2014With assistance from Abhishek Vishnoi, Catherine Ngai, April Ma, Ishika Mookerjee and Allen Wan.Contact us at letters@time.com.",

Together, Weixin and WeChat, used by the Chinese diaspora including in the United States, have around 1.2 billion monthly active users.It was not immediately clear which laws WeChat was referring to in its announcement, but the development comes amid a widening crackdown on technology and now education companies by Chinese regulators that has spooked investors. Tencent\u2019s stock in Hong Kong closed down nearly 9% on Tuesday, its worst day in a decade.Several tech companies, including e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA), have faced investigations for alleged monopolistic behavior or breaches of customer rights, leading to record fines and massive overhauls. Chinese President Xi Jinping has endorsed the probes, calling on regulators to scrutinize tech companies as the country tightens data privacy and security policies.The share prices of Chinese tech companies, including Alibaba, Tencent (TCEHY) and food delivery platform Meituan have all taken a hammering this week. Meituan closed nearly 18% lower in Hong Kong on Tuesday \u2014 eclipsing Monday\u2019s 14% loss \u2014 after Chinese regulators issued new guidelines calling for improved standards for food delivery workers.Earlier this month, China\u2019s Cyberspace Administration suspended the registration of new users from ride-hailing app Didi, torpedoing the company\u2019s stock just two days after its blockbuster New York IPO, which was the biggest US share offering by a Chinese company since Alibaba debuted in 2014.The regulator said it put the suspension in place to \u201cprevent the expansion of risk\u201d during a \u201ccybersecurity review,\u201d but provided no details on why the probe was launched.Days later, the internet watchdog proposed that any company with data on more than 1 million users must seek the agency\u2019s approval before listing its shares overseas.

The rest will be for costs such as fees for bankers, lawyers and accountants.Prosus was spun out of Naspers in 2019 to hold the South African group's international assets, including its 29% stake in Chinese tech giant Tencent (0700.HK). Naspers hoped the move would reduce the discount its shares traded to the value of its holding in Tencent.However, the discount kept widening.To try to address this, Prosus said in May it would issue new shares to buy up to 45.4% of Naspers in a share swap deal. read moreThe deal will move more of Naspers' Tencent stake to Amsterdam from Johannesburg and, according to the two firms, help Naspers close the value gap to its Tencent stake because Prosus' stock is more highly valued than Naspers'.The deal will also increase Prosus' free float on Euronext.\"The overall costs are less than 1% of the total value unlock that happens on day one as result of exchanging high discount Naspers shares to lower discount Prosus shares,\" Prosus told Reuters via email.Some shareholders are unhappy with the costs after they had opposed the deal, saying it would create a complicated cross-holding structure that might increase the discount.\"I wouldn't want to see such huge amounts of money being paid,\" said Peter Takaendesa, head of equities at Mergence Investment Managers in South Africa.\"It is quite material, especially if we are comparing the two transactions,\" he said, referring to the fees paid during the listing of Prosus.Mergence was among 36 fund managers from South Africa who wrote to Prosus' management in June opposing the transaction.In a shareholder vote on July 9 that required a majority to pass, the transaction won 90% backing although up to 47% of outside shareholders in Prosus voted against it. Naspers holds over 73% of Prosus.\"We always work hard to please our shareholders while recognising that we have tens of thousands of shareholders with varying perspectives,\" Prosus said in its statement to Reuters, adding that the majority vote at the Prosus extraordinary general meeting \"confirms shareholder support for the transaction.\"When Naspers listed Prosus in 2019, it paid 29 million euros to financial advisers, compared with the 20 million euros Prosus will pay them for the share swap, the document shows.Prosus did not have to pay any securities transaction tax for the 2019 listing, though investors said that did not address their discontent with the transaction costs.\"When you're doing a bad transaction, and a transaction that many shareholders have expressed a concern on, then any amount you pay is too much,\" said Rajay Ambekar, CEO at Excelsia Capital, a Cape Town-based asset manager with shares in Naspers.\"It is a real cost that shareholders are having to bear.\"($1 = 0.8491 euros)($1 = 14.8968 rand)Reporting by Promit Mukherjee Editing by Rachel Armstrong, Mark Potter and Barbara LewisOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

London-listed shares of Sumo skyrocketed more than 40% on news of the deal Monday.Tencent already owns a 8.75% stake in Sumo, which mainly develops games for other publishers. Sumo's portfolio includes Sackboy: A Big Adventure, a title published by Sony , and several racing games based on Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog franchise.Sumo, which was founded in 2003, has seen a number of shifts in ownership. It was acquired by now-defunct American video game firm Foundation 9 Entertainment in 2008, before being bought back by management in 2014. The company then floated on the London Stock Exchange in 2017.\"In the 18 years since we founded Sumo, we have developed more great games than we could ever have imagined and enjoyed incredible trust and support from our clients, enabling us to grow into a global business, delivering consistently strong financial results,\" said Carl Cavers, Sumo's CEO.\"Tencent intends to bring its expertise and resources to accelerate the growth of Sumo both in the U.K. and abroad, supporting Sumo in the market for top-tier creative talent, and the U.K. as a hub for game innovation,\" said James Mitchell, chief strategy officer at Tencent.\"We believe the proposed transaction benefits all stakeholders, and delivers compelling value for Sumo shareholders, while enhancing Sumo's capabilities for the future.\"",

The Chinese tech giant already has an 8.75-percent stake in the developer, as Gamesindustry.biz reports, and the offer represents a 43-percent premium on Sumo\u2019s current valuation.Based in Sheffield, England, Sumo\u2019s well-regarded core studio Sumo Digital has carried out contract work for many of the biggest names in gaming. It developed Sony\u2019s PlayStation 5 launch title Sackboy: A Big Adventure and was the primary studio behind Microsoft\u2019s Crackdown 3 for Xbox consoles and PC. In 2017 Sumo released Snake Pass for multiple platforms, its first foray into original IP.\u201cThe three founders of Sumo, who work in the business, Paul Porter, Darren Mills and I are passionate about what we do and are fully committed to continuing in our roles,\u201d says Sumo CEO Carl Cavers in a statement. \u201cThe opportunity to work with Tencent is one we just couldn\u2019t miss.

            "description": "Yesterday, Tencent announced they're set to buy UK game developer Sumo Digital, the folks behind games like Crackdown 3, Team Sonic Racing and Sackboy: A Big Adventure. The deal is reportedly worth \u00a3919 million ($1.27 billion), and means Tencent will fully own the company.This isn't the first big acquisition the Chinese tech conglomerate have made, and I'm sure it won't be the last. But now is as good a time as ever to remind ourselves of exactly how many gaming pies Tencent have their thumbs plunged into.Sumo DigitalKicking things off with the Sumo news, GamesIndustry.biz reports that Tencent are set to fully buy Sumo Digital today, after previously having an 8.75% stake in the company. The developer will continue to work on their own games, as well as continue their \"work-for-hire\" projects under the new ownership. It's also worth noting Sumo is the parent company of The Chinese Room, the devs behind Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Dear Esther, and Everybody's Gone To The Rapture.\"The three founders of Sumo who work in the business, Paul Porter, Darren Mills and I, are passionate about what we do and are fully committed to continuing in our roles,\" CEO Carl Cavers said in a statement.\"The opportunity to work with Tencent is one we just couldn't miss. It would bring another dimension to Sumo, presenting opportunities for us to truly stamp our mark on this amazing industry, in ways which have previously been out-of-reach.\"Bohemia InteractiveOne of the other more recent stake purchases for Tencent was with Arma developers Bohemia. In February this year, they bought a minority stake in the company, but didn't disclose exactly how big that stake is, or what sort of money it went for.Dontnod EntertainmentJust a couple of weeks prior to Bohemia, Tencent bought a minority stake in Dontnod, the devs who make the Life Is Strange series. The companies signed a business cooperation agreement, and Dontnod said Tencent had invested a total of \u20ac30 million (about \u00a326.5 million).Dontnod's most recent game Tell Me Why is about twins coming to terms with old family trauma.Remedy EntertainmentIn May this year, Tencent grabbed a 3.8% stake in Remedy, the folks behind Control and Alan Wake. Reportedly, Remedy found out about the sale after another shareholder, Ascendo Capital, had already sold the portion to Tencent.Klei EntertainmentContinuing the new year spate of investments, back in January Tencent also grabbed a majority stake in Don't Starve developers Klei. The devs said Tencent had already assisted them in launching their games in China, and reassured fans that they'd keep \"full autonomy of creative and operations across all aspects of the studio\".Digital Extremes and Splash DamageLate last year, Tencent bought Leyou, a company that owns both Warframe developers Digital Extremes, and Dirty Bomb devs Splash Damage. Both studios put out the usual \"don't worry, nothing will change\" statements, and, at the moment, nothing really has changed.Digital Extremes recently revealed Warframe's next expansion at Tennocon.OtherSide EntertainmentThis is a bit of an odd one, because no stakes or sums of money were discussed in public. But at the beginning of 2020, OtherSide announced that Tencent would be \"taking the System Shock franchise forward\", whatever that means.Riot GamesAn oldie but biggie: Tencent have had a majority stake in Riot Games, the devs behind League Of Legends and Valorant, since 2011. But in 2015 they took full ownership of the company.FuncomTencent used to be the largest shareholders in Conan Exiles developers Funcom, but in 2020 they bought out all the other shareholders. Like Riot, Tencent completely own Funcom.Epic GamesTencent have had a 40% stake in Epic Games, the folks who made Fortnite and a digital storefront that everyone loves to hate, since 2012.Last year, Tencent's investments in Epic and Riot actually caught the attention of the US government. They wanted to know how the Chinese megacorp were handling the security of Americans' personal data.The neverending battle royale.Grinding Gear GamesIn 2018, the conglomerate grabbed a majority stake in Path Of Exile dev Grinding Gear. They own 80% of the developer, and bought that for an \"undisclosed sum\" of money. Despite initial player worries that the devs would start to more aggressively monetise the game, that didn't happen, and to this day the game is still business as usual.Platinum GamesEarly last year, Bayonetta developers Platinum Games announced they'd received a \"partnership investment\" from Tencent, though the actual amount they received wasn't disclosed.Activision BlizzardWay back in 2016, Tencent snapped up a 5% stake in Activision Blizzard after the World Of Warcraft and Overwatch creators wanted to go independent, and escape ownership of the French media conglomerate Vivendi. ActiBliz had already worked with Tencent prior to this to bring their games to China.UbisoftIn 2018, Tencent bought a 5% stake in Ubisoft, helping the Assassin's Creed and Rainbow Six developers fight off their own takeover by Vivendi. It's not a big enough stake for Tencent to be allowed onto the company's board of directors, but they have helped Ubisoft publish games in China.Ubi announced a new FPS shooter XDefiant this week.Bluehole (also known as Krafton)Tencent bought an undisclosed stake in PUBG developers Bluehole in 2017 (though it's rumoured to be around 10%). Later that same year, it was reported that Tencent were looking to completely buy out the company, though no news on it has come about since.Paradox InteractiveCrusader Kings and Europa Universalis makers Paradox sold 5% of their shares to Tencent in 2016. As with most developers on this list, they wanted Tencent's help in establishing their games in the Chinese market.DiscordNot a technically a games company, but games-adjacent: Tencent invested an undisclosed amount of money in the chat app Discord in 2018. Between Tencent and a number of other investors, Discord secured $150 million in funding that year.Frontier DevelopmentsBack to the games: the tech megacorp also own a 9% stake in Elite Dangerous and Planet Zoo makers Frontier. The deal was reportedly worth \u00a317.7 million (about $24m).Some nice meerkats from Planet Zoo. They have no sense of business. What a life that would be.MarvelousLast year, Tencent bought a 20% stake in Story Of Season developers Marvelous for $65 million (around $47.8m). (You might also recognise Marvelous as anime producers.)FatsharkIn 2019, Tencent bought a stake in Swedish Warhammer: Vermintide developers Fatshark. Reports say it's around a 36% stake, worth about 500 million kronor (around \u00a342m or $57m).SharkmobSticking with the sharks, Tencent owns 100% of the indie developer Sharkmob, who're currently working on a battle royale set in the Vampire: The Masquerade universe.Roblox CorporationTencent and Roblox formed a \"strategic partnership\" in 2019. Roblox Corp owns a 51% stake allowing them to keep control, while a Tencent subsidiary Songhua owns 49%.Roblox, a game filled with games.10 Chambers CollectiveIn 2020, GTFO devs 10 Chambers announced Tencent had acquired a majority stake in the company.Yager DevelopmentTencent owns yet another undisclosed majority stake in Spec Ops: The Line developers Yager.SupercellThey also own a majority stake in mobile developers Supercell, who make Clash Of Clans.So there it is: if you play games, it's likely Tencent owns at least a small part of the developer or publisher that made something you like. It's such a huge number of companies to go through, it's entirely possible I've missed one or two as well.At the end of it all, here's your frequent reminder that games industry consolidation is something we shouldn't ignore. It took me a long time to put this list together, and that's pretty concerning.",

Earlier this year, the anti-monopoly regulator placed a record $2.75 billion fine on e-commerce giant Alibaba for engaging in anti-competitive behaviour.Huya and DouYu did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the SAMR decision.In a memo from SAMR published concurrently with the announcement, Zhang Chenying, a member of the state council's anti-trust committee, argued the deal would prevent fair competition.\"If Huya and DouYu are to merge, the original joint control of Douyu will become Tencent's complete control of a merged entity,\" Zhang wrote.\"Considering factors such as revenue, active users, livestreaming resources and other key indices, we can expect that a merger would eliminate or restrict fair competition.\"",

It deals a blow to Tencent, a shareholder in both companies, and comes as Beijing steps up scrutiny over tech giants from Didi Global Inc. to Meituan. The transaction, valued at about $6 billion at the time, was negotiated before the government crackdown that began in late 2020 and was aimed at creating the country\u2019s dominant live-streamed gaming leader, akin to Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s Twitch.Guangzhou-based Huya offered to buy its competitor in October, proposing an all-stock transaction that would have created a combined business valued at about $11 billion at the time. Tencent would have had about 68% of the merged business\u2019s voting shares.But regulators announced a review of the acquisition in December as part of stepped-up scrutiny of previous M&A deals in the internet sector. Many companies, including Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., have since been fined 500,000 yuan ($77,000) per deal, for failing to declare past acquisitions under the country\u2019s anti-monopoly laws.DouYu\u2019s U.S.-traded shares slid 3.2% as the market opened in New York on Monday and Huya was down 2%.(Updates with shares)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "description": "Tencent, the biggest game company in the world, is rolling out facial recognition technology that will likely scan many gamers\u2019 faces every single evening, aiming to catch minors breaking a gaming curfew and help prevent video game addiction (via Gizmodo). That\u2019s a lot of controversial concepts in one sentence, no?Here\u2019s what\u2019s going on, according to the company and China games industry analyst Daniel Ahmad.In China, video game addiction prevention is literally the law of the land, one that\u2019s been evolving for many years but recently hit some important milestones. In 2019, China introduced a law that banned minors from playing video games between 10PM and 8AM or from playing more than 90 minutes on a weekday. And as of June 1st, 2021, every game in the country is required to add a new authentication system that checks a player\u2019s Chinese national identity (including their age) to help block underage players from going past those limits, all in the name of preventing video game addiction.Video game addiction prevention is already the law of the landTencent had actually already been using Chinese IDs for a couple years now, among other attempts to curb addiction, but the company tells us that underage players kept finding ways to get around them \u2014 like using their parents\u2019 accounts.The so-called \u201cMidnight Patrol\u201d facial recognition system is an attempt to check that an \u201cadult\u201d is actually an adult. It launched July 5th in over 60 mobile games, including the hits Honor of Kings and Game for Peace \u2014 aka China\u2019s more patriotic version of PUBG. The facial recognition system is only for China and only for mobile games, the company confirms, so PC games like League of Legends are currently exempt. It\u2019s all part of the company\u2019s ongoing \u201cBalanced Online Entertainment System\u201d initiative, Tencent tells The Verge, which also encompasses its \u201cParental Guardian Platform\u201d and \u201cHealthy Gameplay System\u201d designed to let parents know what their kids are up to and remind users when they\u2019ve played for too long, respectively.According to Ahmad, whose firm Niko Partners sometimes works with Tencent, here\u2019s how the facial recognition part of the system operates: \u201cIt will essentially detect if the person playing the game after midnight is doing so for a long time or spending a certain amount of money in the game, and it will tick a box in Tencent's backend and prompt the user to verify their identity through facial recognition, either through that database or through a database they\u2019ve already used,\u201d says Ahmad.Tencent says it doesn\u2019t store any of the new scans itself; instead, it sounds like it\u2019s building on China\u2019s already-established state facial recognition surveillance system, and any scans Chinese users will have already given Tencent. Ahmad says all of Tencent\u2019s games in China use WeChat IDs for login, and the \u201cMidnight Patrol\u201d can use China\u2019s national citizen database of face photos to check against as well. China\u2019s surveillance engine has also been used for more troubling things, of course, like the country\u2019s human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims.It uses cameras akin to Face ID, we\u2019re told, so not something you\u2019d fool with a photoTencent does make it sound like it won\u2019t necessarily be scanning the faces of minors, though. When a user playing games after hours is prompted for a facial scan, they can simply refuse, at which point they\u2019ll be treated as a minor and booted out of the game, according to a machine translation of Tencent\u2019s press release.Tencent actually started trialing this facial recognition system in 2018, and Ahmad says it hasn\u2019t changed much since then. He says the company also started running this kind of check last year when Tencent realized a lot of kids were likely stealing their grandparents\u2019 accounts. \u201cA lot of kids are living with their grandparents, because their parents are working in the city, so they\u2019re likely to use their grandparents\u2019 account without their knowledge,\u201d says Ahmad.",

            "description": "Tencent, the Chinese gaming conglomerate, has introduced a controversial tool to curb the gaming activities of minors during nighttime in Mainland China. The new system leverages facial recognition technology to detect and verify if an individual is a minor, and prevents them to play games during prohibited hours.The company is reportedly calling the system \u201cmidnight patrol\u201d. It aims to combat game addiction in individuals aged under the age of 18 in China. The system essentially requires every gamer to comply with the facial recognition system. Tencent\u2019s tool will analyze the faces of individuals and match them with pictures and names stored in a database to detect minors.For those unaware, way back in 2019, the Chinese government passed \u201canti-addiction\u201d regulations in the country to bar minors from playing excessive games at night. The regulation restricted playtime, imposed curfews, and capped in-game purchases for any individual aged under 18. Moreover, the law restricted under-18 gamers to play games between 10 PM to 8 AM, limiting them to just 1.5 hours of playtime on weekdays and 3 hours on weekends and holidays.Following this, Tencent says that many gamers have used \u201cwrong tricks\u201d to game the system and play during prohibited hours anyway. So, with the midnight patrol system, Tencent aims to make sure that minors do not have access to games at night.\u201cAnyone who refuses or fails the face verification will be treated as a minor, and as outlined in the anti-addiction supervision of Tencent\u2019s game health system, and kicked offline,\u201d the company said in a statement.\u201cWe will conduct a face screening for accounts registered with real names and that have played for a certain period of time at night. Anyone who refuses or fails the face verification will be treated as a minor, and as outlined in the anti-addiction supervision of Tencent\u2019s game health system, and kicked offline,\u201d Tencent further added.The midnight patrol system is currently live in China and will be initially active for over 60 games, including popular games such as Honor of Kings, Glory of the King, Peace Elite, and more. The company plans to add more games to the list in the coming days. Further, Riot Games\u2019 popular League of Legends title, in which Tencent owns a large stake, is reportedly on the list as well.So, as you can imagine, it is going to be a pretty grim situation for kids in China. On the other way around, as game addiction has been a critical phenomenon amongst the under-aged population, it might actually be a wise move by Tencent. However, there is always a privacy factor when it comes to facial recognition systems, especially when we are talking about kids. So, if Tencent does not act responsibly, the company might face some serious backlash in the coming weeks.",

Tencent is Huya's biggest shareholder at 36.9% and owns a third of Douyu, meaning that it would have surged ahead of its competitors had the deal been successful.China's State Administration for Market Regulation said on Saturday that it would kill the merger because the deal would give Tencent control of more than 70% of the industry, letting it create a \"two-way vertical blockade in the upstream and downstream market.\"\"Under China's recent anti-trust drive, this is a no-go zone,\" wrote Kendra Schaefer, head of tech policy research at Beijing-based consultancy Trivium China, in an email to Insider.Advertisement\"This is a simple question of market dominance,\" she added.With the deal blocked, there is now more opportunity for Tencent's competitors, including TikTok developer ByteDance and e-Commerce king Alibaba, to tap into China's billion-dollar game streaming market.Bytedance hosts live game streaming on Douyin, its Chinese version of TikTok, while Alibaba has been pushing livestreams where influencers sell products to viewers.Beijing's crackdown on big tech antitrustMeanwhile, SAMR has also ordered Tencent this week to drop exclusive rights with some music labels, reported Reuters, but then allowed it to buy Sogou, China's second-largest search engine.AdvertisementSchaefer told Insider that the antitrust watchdog approved the latter deal because it would not give Tencent a market monopoly.But there will definitely be more scrutiny on mergers and acquisitions in China's big tech moving forward, she added.Beijing has set its sights on big tech antitrust issues in recent years, especially since it launched SAMR in 2018.

They included real-name registration, barring children playing between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m., and capping purchases on the gaming platform.Authorities stepped in after a number of gaming-related incidents \u2014 from teenagers stealing money to top up their accounts to them spending significant time at internet caf\u00e9s \u2014 raised concerns over the physical and mental wellbeing of young gamers. Experts have also blamed the growing number of children with myopia in the country on the increase in screen time.Tencent will initially launch the facial screening feature for over 60 popular games, including \u201cHonor of Kings\u201d and \u201cGame for Peace,\u201d and plans to incorporate more titles in the future, according to the company.

She said her seven-year-old child is a fan of Tencent\u2019s popular game \u201cHonor of Kings\u201d and allows him to play for about 30 minutes once or twice a week using her account.

            "description": "Late-night gaming sessions for Chinese children are going to be much harder now that Tencent , China's largest tech company, is using facial recognition to stop kids from gaming after bedtime. Announced in a press release yesterday, Tencent said its new technology would require players to confirm their identity via facial recognition algorithm in order to keep playing mobile games past 10 pm. It's just the latest step Chinese companies are taking to conform (and stay ahead of) China's tightening regulations concerning when and how underage people play games.So far the feature has been activated in 60 of Tencent's mobile games, including Honor of Kings and Game for Peace, but the feature will roll out to more of Tencent's mobile games over time.The way it works is simple: If children under the age of 18 try to play a game after 10 pm or before 8 am, they'll have to pass a check that uses the phone's camera to verify their identity and age. This extra measure is in place to stop children who were easily circumventing previous age-gating methods to enforce China's strict laws on gaming activity.Back in 2019, the government body responsible for regulating China's enormous games industry released a new set of restrictions that mandated Chinese gaming companies implement real name verification systems as well as limits to how long children can play and how much they can spend. Some of the systems designed to enforce these rules were evidently easy to sidestep, however, which is why Tencent is now using more air-tight methods like facial recognition in order to limit infractions.The Chinese government says these regulations are to curb gaming addiction in China, where mobile and PC gaming are both massively popular. At the same time, privacy advocates are concerned that this collected data could be used for more nefarious reasons, like China's social credit system where some citizens can be penalized for a variety of behaviors deemed unsuitable by the government like not sorting their recycling properly.At the same time, it also presents a moral dilemma for the developers who have to implement these systems\u2014especially if they're not Chinese. Over the past few years, Tencent has aggressively expanded its influence in the gaming industry by investing in a variety of companies including Yager, Epic Games, and Platinum Games.Back in 2019, Riot Games was the subject of controversy after it was pressured to implement anti-addiction measures in the Chinese version of League of Legends. Tencent owns a 100% stake in Riot Games, despite it being an American company. But by creating systems that were used to collect data and monitor the behavior of Chinese players, it raises thorny questions about how complicit American developers would be if that data were then used to violate those player's freedoms.But interestingly, according to a Digital Trends report , the Chinese version of League of Legends is not using this new facial recognition system yet\u2014but it's likely it will be added eventually.It's also clear that this new facial recognition system is an attempt by Tencent to continue to stay in the Chinese government's good graces. Despite China's gaming industry being so large (estimates say that it will reach 781 million gamers and $55 billion in revenue by 2025), it's also extremely volatile. In 2019, an overhaul of how China regulates and censors games led to a total freeze on the release of new games that lasted nearly 9 months. During that time, Tencent estimated it lost $190 billion in market value.",

REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw/File Photo Acquire Licensing RightsSummaryCompanies Investors, analysts say valuation gap may never closeCompany M&A to accelerate under Vision Fund veteranHigh tech industry prices not a problem -Prosus CEOAMSTERDAM/JOHANNESBURG, July 8 (Reuters) - Prosus, Europe's answer to SoftBank and its Vision Fund, is betting that its long-term investments can fill a yawning valuation gap and give it the same name recognition as one of the world's most aggressive technology investors.Based in the Netherlands, Prosus was spun out of South Africa's Naspers in 2019 with a mandate to manage the spoils of a $32 million bet on China's Tencent, now worth $200 billion, on a 30-year investment horizon.Japanese giant SoftBank's own firepower is backstopped by its stake in Alibaba, which has its origins in CEO Masayoshi Son's $20 million investment in the Chinese e-commerce firm.A banker who has worked with both Prosus and Softbank describes them as \"the two global elephants out there with massive permanent capital\" for tech investments, and the rivals are also sometimes co-investors.In an indication of its ambition, Prosus last month hired Ervin Tu, a managing partner at Vision Fund and a former technology banker at Goldman Sachs, to head its group M&A.Jean Pierre Verster, CEO of South African investment manager Protea, which holds almost 10% of its fund assets in Prosus, says Tu's appointment \"tells you that there's probably going to be more (M&A) activity coming down the line\".That is already evident as since April, Prosus has made a dozen investments, last month announcing the $1.8 billion acquisition of software developer platform Stack Overflow.\"We have significant capacity on the balance sheet, and we also see really good opportunities in the segments we operate today,\" Chief Executive Bob van Dijk told Reuters, adding that while Prosus at times competed with SoftBank there were significant differences between the two investors.Verster sees the Stack Overflow acquisition as a sign that Prosus may \"get a bit more aggressive\", although he expects the group, which owns a mix of controlling and minority stakes in many tech firms, will remain more conservative than Softbank.MIND THE GAPProsus (PRX.AS) has not had easy ride in its first few years, with a complicated structure and operating losses at most investments it has made, apart from Tencent(0700.HK), leading it to trade at a deep discount to the value of its assets.Its stock market valuation is 25% lower than the market value of the 28.9% stake in Tencent it currently holds. At Naspers, which in turn controls Prosus, the discount to its economic interest in Tencent is more than 40%.(For an interactive graphic, click on https://tmsnrt.rs/3hD4Ukk)Bob van Dijk, who also heads Naspers, says this discount is transitory and investors have done well so far and will continue to in the long term.\"You just need to look through (the losses) and the potential and the strength of the business model is much more important than short-term profitability,\" he said.One way of narrowing the gap is by gradually offloading the crown jewels, and Prosus raised $15 billion by selling a 2% stake in WeChat owner Tencent in April.A third of that will go to share buybacks once a cross-holding structure with Naspers, has been set up. Prosus shareholders are set to approve the deal on Friday.Prosus says the real solution to the valuation gap is finding more new investments and improving profitability at the old ones until they rival or even eclipse the Tencent holding.And that is why the remaining $10 billion from its most recent stake sale is being ploughed back into broadening the Prosus portfolio, which spans online classified firms, fintech, educational software and online food ordering and delivery.NO END GAMEFinding the next Tencent among tens of thousands of technology start-ups around the globe is the challenge facing Van Dijk and his new SoftBank hire Tu.Prosus invests in only one out of every 200 or 300 opportunities it reviews, Van Dijk said, in the range of sectors it knows well. The more mature portfolio ranges from U.S.-based Codecademy, to Indian food deliverer Swiggy, to Russia's Mail.Ru to global marketplace operator OLX.Early stage investments are generated by a two-dozen person venture arm, where Banafsheh Fathieh is head of Americas. Investments of more than $200 million go through the Prosus board.Fathieh, who works out of a small office in San Francisco, says her portfolio is a far cry from the Silicon Valley bubble.\"We are a different brand of venture capital. If you're taking a 30 year point of view, you can go after entrepreneurs that have lifelong dreams to build companies that will last,\" she said in an interview.Fathieh said that what makes Prosus/Naspers unique is its willingness to invest in entrepreneurs and businesses it believes in, without the 3-7 year \"exit plan\" that frames most venture capital and private equity investments.At Prosus/Naspers, Fathieh said, \"there is no end game\".FOOD FOR THOUGHTFood ordering and delivery is an industry where Prosus is clearly hungry for more. Its initial 2017 investments in Delivery Hero (DHER.DE) have tripled in value and in March it paid 2.2 billion euros to increase its stake in the German firm.One target is iFood of Brazil, a company that delivered 500 million meals last year. Prosus owns a two-thirds stake, and co-owner Just Eat Takeaway.com is looking to divest the other third for more than $2 billion.Such investments are delivering growth and for the year ended March 31, Prosus reported revenue at its non-Tencent ecommerce businesses grew by 46% to $6.2 billion.Although trading losses were $429 million, Prosus' net profit including Tencent nearly doubled to $7.45 billion, underlining how much the stake still dominates results.\"If they grow at say, 30% per year ... I am happy,\" Protea's Verster said. \"Any narrowing of the discount is just a bonus.\"Analyst Ken Rumph of Jefferies, who rates Prosus shares a hold, says the market discount may persist after the cross-holding structure is in place as \"investors are put off by the same issues they had with Naspers,\" including a complicated control structure.And the Tencent stake will long outshine other management actions, Rumph said, adding: \"Even a continued 20% return on investments elsewhere in the portfolio will take years to shift the balance away from Tencent\".Reporting by Toby Sterling, Promit Mukerjee, Abhinav Ramnarayan; Editing by Rachel Armstrong and Alexander SmithOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "description": "The surprise probe by China\u2019s internet regulator piles on the scrutiny of Didi over concerns ranging from antitrust issues to data security.Didi Global Inc. tumbled Friday after China said it\u2019s starting a cybersecurity review of the ride-hailing company just two days after it pulled off one of the biggest U.S. stock market debuts of the past decade.The move is to prevent data security risks, safeguard national security and protect public interest, according to a statement from the Cyberspace Administration of China. Didi has halted new user registrations during the probe. The company, which only started trading on Wednesday in New York after an initial public offering, fell 7% to $15.26.The surprise probe by China\u2019s internet regulator piles on the scrutiny of Didi over issues ranging from antitrust to data security. The company has been grappling with a broad antitrust probe into China\u2019s internet firms with uncertain outcomes for Didi and peers like major backer Tencent Holdings Ltd.More broadly, Beijing has been curbing the growing influence of China\u2019s largest internet corporations, widening an effort to tighten the ownership and handling of troves of information that internet giants from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Tencent and Didi scoop up daily from hundreds of millions of users.Didi lost as much as 11% of its market value at one point on Friday, a rapid turnaround that underscores the uncertainty surrounding the Chinese government\u2019s crackdown on the internet sector.Earlier this year, the State Administration for Market Regulation announced it was looking into alleged abuses including forced merchant exclusivity arrangements at Meituan, days after China\u2019s third-largest internet company raised $9.98 billion from a record share placement and convertible bonds sale.\u201cThis is deeply unfair to investors,\u201d said Brock Silvers, chief investment officer at Hong Kong-based private equity firm Kaiyuan Capital. \u201cAnd as a crucial matter of market integrity, China\u2019s regulators should cease allowing companies to list while under investigation.\u201dThe CAC didn\u2019t specify what it will look into. But the timing of its announcement was significant, coming not just on the heels of Didi\u2019s IPO but also the Communist Party\u2019s 100th anniversary celebrations in Beijing.\u201cDidi will fully cooperate with the relevant government authority during the review,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe plan to conduct comprehensive examination of cybersecurity risks and continuously improve on our cybersecurity systems and technology capacities\u201dFounded in 2012 by Cheng Wei, Didi managed to force a retreat of its U.S. rival Uber Technologies Inc. in 2016 and embarked on an ambitious international expansion. Its U.S. IPO was highly anticipated and marked the second-biggest debut by a Chinese company, trailing only Alibaba.Didi has faced regulatory scrutiny ever since a pair of murders in 2018 that Cheng has called its \u201cdarkest days.\u201d The Beijing-based firm responded to the subsequent crackdown with a fusillade of efforts to improve security across its network of half a billion.It began to explore new businesses to offset slowing ride-hailing growth, from car repairs to grocery delivery. That served it well during the coronavirus pandemic, when whole cities came to a standstill. The company delivered an $837 million profit in the March quarter \u2014 a rarity among recent high-profile IPOs.The company, which was among 34 internet giants ordered by regulators in April to correct \u2018excesses,\u2019 warned in a regulatory filing that it couldn\u2019t assure investors that government officials would be satisfied with its efforts or that it would escape penalties.",

And while he's spent his more recent years at Blizzard working on Diablo 4 and World of Warcraft, he had an itch to return to the real-time strategy genre.\"I've always wanted to take a shot at another RTS game for a very long time now, maybe close to a decade,\" Kim tells GamesIndustry.biz in a recent conversation. \"I had been reached out to by various people and I've talked to various companies, but these ones felt like an opportunity of a lifetime for me... If we were going to take a stab at the next great RTS, I thought we needed the right company, the right people within our development team, and we need clearly aligned beliefs in what we're trying to do.\"It turns out the right company was Tencent subsidiary Lightspeed and Quantum Studios, which helped Kim set up Uncapped Games with the right people, including Uncapped lead producer Jason Hughes and Uncapped lead engineer Zhongshan Zhang, both also Blizzard veterans.From left: Zhang, Kim, and HughesAs for the alignment of beliefs, Kim says the team was very much on the same page as the head of Lightspeed Jerry Chen when they met.\"One of the things he said was 'Just focus on making a great PC RTS game, and don't worry about other factors,\" Kim says. \"The measurement of success is if we have a great game.\"\"It's also really nice to be at a company that really believes in the team, believes in the game, believes in what we're doing...\" Jason HughesHughes calls the combination \"a perfect storm\" of the right people combined with a very clear vision for what they want to achieve.\"It's also really nice to be at a company that really believes in the team, believes in the game, believes in what we're doing, and exactly like David said, there's a lot of RTS interest, especially from the CEO, and he really just wants us to make a great game,\" Hughes says.He adds, \"Lightspeed and Quantum very much believe in the genre and really want something like this to succeed. To say, 'Just make a great PC RTS game,' that isn't something one hears a lot, and to me that was a big motivating factor.\"Those comments might raise eyebrows considering Uncapped's leaders are all coming from a company where they had access to a seminal RTS franchise.\"I can only speak for myself,\" Hughes says when asked why they had to form Uncapped for this project. \"For me it wasn't so much about what wasn't possible; it was about what really excited me and what is newly possible.\"Kim adds that part of the ambition for Uncapped's first title was just better-suited for a fresh start.\"If we're making a sequel to an RTS, there are some things that have to be in that game to make it a sequel. But if we make it a brand new game, it opens up more possibilities on the game design side to be able to execute what we want to execute the best. That's the advantage we have here, I think.\"\"We wanted to make a real strategy game rather than one where who can click the fastest is the best player\" David KimAs for what they want to execute, Kim describes it as \"the most action-packed PC RTS that has the lowest barrier to entry that is still impossible to master.\"\"RTS has been in this place where a lot of the very basic and core fundamental things in the game have not yet been modernized, so it's very difficult to play an RTS,\" he says. \"You need hundreds of actions per minute to play a competitive RTS game.\"So what we want to do is modernize a lot of it, and make it so any gamer can play this game. And to play at a competitive level, you don't need to practice the mechanics of it for a decade; you have to be good at the strategy, or countering what you're seeing on the enemy's side. We wanted to make a real strategy game rather than one where who can click the fastest is the best player.\"While Uncapped officially just started last month, Hughes says they believe they've landed on a design that will do just that.\"That doesn't mean dumbed down or simplified,\" Hughes notes. \"That just means lowering the barrier to entry for more people to expose them to what's great about RTS games.\"To execute on that design, Uncapped is hoping to get some version of the game in the community's hands as quickly as possible, and to rework it based on the feedback for as long as possible.\"Iteration, iteration, iteration,\" Hughes stresses as key to the development process. \"Get something in the game so we can test it as soon as possible, but eventually when we start bringing players into the game as well, it's going to be about the feedback and about iterating on that design.\"Hughes says he wants to keep the scope of the game manageable, and to have the team be as small and agile as possible as well. For now, that means Uncapped is a team of eight based out of the Los Angeles neighborhood of Playa Vista. They have a plan to grow to 20 by the end of this year, but after that, Hughes says the total headcount will be more dependent on milestones and what they need to accomplish and when rather than anything they've set in stone already.They're a little more concrete when it comes to their goals for the company culture.\"We really want people to be honest with each other,\" Hughes says. \"We want to be open to transparency, and we are putting an emphasis on respect. We don't want a place where egos are driving any kind of decision or discussion.\"We want to be very open... and ultimately arrive at what is good for the game more than anything.\"",

This would mark the first month of outflow for the $730 billion internet giant via the trading link with Hong Kong since May 2020.After rising to within a whisker of joining the trillion-dollar club earlier this year, Tencent began to slip as investors grew concerned about valuations and moves by the People\u2019s Bank of China to reign in pandemic easy-money policies. With antitrust watchdogs probing alleged monopolistic behavior by the country\u2019s internet titans over the past few months, the stock is now down 23% from its January record high.Loss of support from mainland investors, who account for almost a third of Tencent\u2019s daily turnover, could signal that the worst is not yet over.READ: Tencent Wipeout Reaches $240 Billion: What to Watch in ChinaWhile the company\u2019s sales have been boosted by increased demand for online content and services, investors have grown concerned over its profit margins due to its plans for major spending to fend off competitors such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and ByteDance Ltd.\u201cThere haven\u2019t been many bright spots in Tencent\u2019s fundamentals,\u201d said Dai Ming, a fund manager at Huichen Asset Management. \u201cThe advertising segment is not beating estimates, while the online gaming business may not see as high growth as last year when China recovers from the pandemic.\u201dEven with June\u2019s exit, mainland investors still hold about 7% of Tencent\u2019s stock, near the highest since at least March 2017.\u201cThe shares won\u2019t do well when there is lack of liquidity and earnings support,\u201d he said. \u201cMainland traders\u2019 selling of Tencent is likely to continue in the second half.\u201d\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.",

The arcade-based title developed by Konami was an amazing title you could enjoy playing with your loved ones or go for a solo adventure. Well now, you will be able to enjoy the game on your Android and iOS devices. Konami has partnered with Tencent to release it for mobile devices.Contra Returns Coming to iOS and AndroidKonami, the original developer and the publisher of the title, first collaborated with the Chinese giant Tencent to develop a mobile version of Contra back in 2016. Dubbed as Contra Returns, the title was developed by Tencent\u2019s TiMi Studios and was released in China in 2017.Konami is aiming to bring the title to the North American region in the coming days. It will be the first Contra title to be released in the US after the 2019 Contra: Rogue Corps and the Contra: Anniversary Collection.Back in July 2020, TiMi Studios, the Tencent subsidiary involved in the development of the upcoming Pokemon Unite title, asked its fans whether they want Contra Returns to release in the Western region. Following positive feedback from users, the company has announced to release the game in the US. You can check out the official promo video right below.As you can see, Contra Returns will be similar to its Chinese counterpart and will bring the classic, arcade-like gameplay to your mobile device. Although there are additional characters, the game features the powerful Contra background score and the iconic Contra heroes Bill Rizer and Lance Bean to an iOS or an Android device near you.I remember, back in my wee days, I used to play Contra with my brother day-in and day-out. So, as you can imagine, seeing the game release for mobile devices will bring back a lot of good memories.If you have played the game already, I\u2019m sure you are going to love this version. As for those who did not get a chance to try out Contra in the past, you can surely give Contra Returns a try for a fun and action-packed mobile gaming experience.AvailabilityThe game is currently available for pre-order on iOS and is open for pre-registration on Android devices via the Google Play Store. Pre-registered players will also get special in-game rewards when the game goes live next month. It will launch in the North American region on July 26.",

GamesBeat first reported the news.The new studio, TiMi Seattle, has a stated goal to \u201cmake a new AAA-caliber, live service FPS game\u201d (i.e. Call of Duty, CounterStrike) for the PC and console market. Its team has already expanded to 25 employees, and is actively recruiting more from both the Seattle and Los Angeles area.\u201cJoining TiMi has given us a chance to create something new and exciting at a blockbuster scale and we are hiring talented developers to join us,\u201d said Warner, the studio\u2019s creative director, in a statement to GeekWire. \u201cI\u2019ve worked in the Seattle area for much of my career and TiMi agreed with me that it would be a great opportunity to build a talented team capable of making new, AAA games. We\u2019re still finalizing our office location but it will be in downtown Bellevue.\u201dWe\u2019re ready to rock Seattle (and LA)! ????Console and ????PC players \u2013 be ready to join us on our new and exciting journey to make a new AAA-caliber, live service FPS game! Read more about our new team on @gamesbeat here: https://t.co/lUl08Fdrzl \u2014 TiMi Studio Group (@timistudios) June 23, 2021TiMi\u2019s Seattle studio is its second location in North America, following an office in Los Angeles that it opened in May 2020.While many Americans may not have heard of it, TiMi Studios is one of the most successful game developers in China. TiMi, founded in 2008 in Shenzhen as Jade Studio, is a subsidiary of the well-known Chinese conglomerate Tencent.TiMi\u2019s lead title is arguably Honor of Kings, a player-vs.-player MOBA for mobile devices, which announced in November that it had surpassed 100 million daily active users. There are apparently more people playing Honor of Kings on any given day this year than there are people living in Vietnam.Outside of China, a revised edition of HoK is published by Tencent Games for iOS and Android as Arena of Valor. Notably, it features several crossover characters from DC Comics, including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and the Flash.Other hits from TiMi include Call of Duty: Mobile, Pok\u00e9mon UNITE, and Speed Drifters. Reportedly, this all added up to TiMi earning $10 billion in revenue in 2020. By way of comparison, Activision Blizzard, the U.S. publisher behind the core Call of Duty franchise, which reliably fields at least one of the best-selling games in any given year, posted revenues of $8.09 billion for 2020.As such, TiMi\u2019s North American office clearly has the financial backing on tap to make whatever sort of game it likes, which in turn could pose a challenge to big live-service games like CoD, Fortnite, and the forthcoming Halo Infinite. Since this is an explicitly AAA game, however, it\u2019s safe to assume that TiMi Seattle won\u2019t have anything to show in public for at least the next couple of years. The video game industry uses \u201cAAA,\u201d a term it borrowed from baseball, to indicate big-budget games made with large teams, which usually translates to a years-long development schedule.TiMi also announced in April that it had entered into a strategic partnership with Xbox Game Studios, although the details behind that deal remain unclear.",

            "description": "Sari-sari stores are neighborhood stores in the Philippines that usually sell daily necessities and sometimes serve as community hubs, too. Today GrowSari, a startup that is digitizing sari-sari stores with features like pricing tools, inventory management and working capital loans, announced it has raised a Series B from several notable investors that brings its total funding to $30 million.The company\u2019s Series B is at a rolling close, so it has not announced a final amount. The $30 million total it has raised includes its seed funding and Series A, which, according to the Ken was $14 million. Participants in its Series B included Temasek Holdings\u2019 private equity unit Pavilion Capital, Tencent, International Finance Corporation (IFC), ICCP SBI Venture Partners and Saison Capital, and returning investors Robinsons Retail Holdings (which is part of the Gokongwei Group), JG Digital Equity Ventures and Wavemaker Partners.GrowSari was founded in 2016, and says its B2B platform is currently used by more than 50,000 stores in over 100 municipalities on Luzon, the Philippines\u2019 largest and most populated island. Its ultimate goal is to serve one million sari-sari stores.According to GrowSari, there are more than 1.1 million sari-sari stores in the Philippines, and they account for 60% of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sold in the country, making them a valuable distribution channel for wholesalers. In addition to its supplier marketplace, GrowSari says it is able to give sari-sari store operators better pricing for products from about a thousand FMCG brands, including Unilever, P&G and Nestle, which it claims can help stores double their earnings. Other services in the app include online telecom and utility bill payments, remittance and microfinancing for working capital loans.GrowSari\u2019s founding team includes Reymund Rollan, Shiv Choudhury, Siddhartha Kongara and Andrzej Ogonowski, who first launched the platform as a backend system for sari-sari stores to manage their logistics and inventory.Since most sari-sari stores are run individually, their margins are smaller than large retailers that can negotiate deals with FMCG wholesalers. GrowSari\u2019s supplier marketplace addresses this issue by giving sari-sari stores access to the Distributor List Prices seen by large stores and wholesalers. GrowSari\u2019s marketplace does not require a minimum order, and it allows sari-sari stores on the platform to pay with cash on delivery, GrowCoins (or cash credits that can be topped up through GrowSari\u2019s shippers, online transfers, banks or over-the-counter at convenience stores) or E-Lista, GrowSari\u2019s seven-day loan product.GrowSari\u2019s new capital will be used to expand its userbase to 300,000 new stores in the Philippines, especially in Visayas and Mindanao, increase the size of its supplier marketplace and launch more financial products for sari-sari stores. The startup is part of a new crop of B2B platforms in Asia focused on serving micro to small-enterprises, including BukuWarung and BukuKas in Indonesia and Khatabook in India.",

            "description": "A screenshot of the new announcement appeared on the Twitter-like social platform Weibo on Friday, informing employees at the Tencent Games subsidiary of a new policy called \u201cWednesday Health Day\u201d.The move by Lightspeed & Quantum Studios, which also developed the patriotic Chinese title Game for Peace, has been criticised on social media because it hardly makes a dent in China\u2019s tech industry culture of working 9am to 9pm, six days a week.The Tencent-backed gaming studio responsible for PUBG Mobile will encourage employees go home at 6pm under a new policy designed to counter China\u2019s gruelling 996 work culture, but there is a catch: it only applies one day a week.Employees were invited to clock off at 6pm on Wednesdays only. Overtime work during the rest of the week was still allowed, but only up to 9pm.Under the change, workers were guaranteed weekends off. If they are required to work Saturdays or Sundays to finish urgent projects, management needs to justify the request. The announcement also said employees are not allowed to work overtime for two consecutive days.Tencent\u2019s Interactive Entertainment Group (IEG) confirmed that the gaming company introduced the measures to encourage employees to seek a healthy work-life balance. Photo: APTencent\u2019s Interactive Entertainment Group (IEG), which includes Tencent Games, confirmed to state media outlet The Paper on Friday that the gaming company introduced the measures to encourage its employees to seek a healthy work-life balance, spend more time with their families, and to improve work efficiency.Tencent did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the South China Morning Post.Exceptionally long working hours have become an unwritten rule at many high-profile tech companies in China. At TikTok operator ByteDance, employees have to work a six-day week every two weeks, while telecoms giant Huawei Technologies Co routinely asks staff for a six-day week every month in return for extra pay or compensation leave.Lauded by tech bosses such as Jack Ma, founder of Post owner Alibaba Group Holding, the 996 schedule has seen resistance from tech workers for years, with the practice coming under the spotlight again after the death of two employees at social commerce giant Pinduoduo in January.The Wednesday working hours adopted by Lightspeed & Quantum Studios garnered heated discussion online.\u201cThe leaders like to show off while the workers are forced to work overtime,\u201d said one comment on Weibo.Other commenters noted that working conditions once considered a regular part of labour laws are now being presented as \u201cperks\u201d.Chinese media and internet users have often attributed reports of premature deaths of young tech workers to punishing workloads. Although China\u2019s labour law bars employees from working more than eight hours a day and 44 hours a week, and overtime is capped at 36 hours a month, big tech companies have yet to face repercussions for the overtime worked by employees.In 2019, a survey by online recruitment platform Zhilian Zhaopin found that more than 70 per cent of 10,000 respondents said they had gone unpaid for overtime work.Tech firms, however, are still popular among young Chinese employees as salaries are generally higher than those in the manufacturing and services sectors, according to experts.Some employees have found ways to cope with 996. A practice called \u201ctouching fish\u201d has gained popularity, with workers saying they hide in toilets and watch videos for hours, or secretly read novels on their work desktops to avoid work.The term is borrowed from a Chinese proverb \u201cto fish in troubled waters\u201d, which means one should take advantage of a crisis to chase personal gain.",

            "description": "Two of Indonesia\u2019s biggest startups, e-commerce marketplace Tokopedia and ride-hailing service Gojek, joined forces last month to merge as the GoTo group, giving birth to a regional technology powerhouse that accounts for 2% of the Southeast Asian country\u2019s GDP.The newly merged entity, valued at USD 18 billion with tentacles spanning across e-commerce, ride-hailing, logistics, and financial services, has a combined two million drivers, 11 million merchants, and a total transaction volume of USD 22 billion by 2020. The merger is expected to fortify its competitiveness against two of its nemeses in the region\u2014Grab and Sea group.Grab has not always been a foe. Rumor had it once that Gojek and Grab, the Southeast Asian ride-hailing duo, were in merger talks. However, the deal fell apart due to regulatory concerns, given that both Grab and Gojek have dominating positions in Southeast Asia\u2019s ride-hailing market. So the combination of Grab and Gojek would easily be ruled as monopolistic by the regional\u2019s trustbusters.For the merger between Gojek and Tokopedia that led to the GoTo group, though, regulatory scrutiny is less of a concern as the two have very few overlapping businesses.The biggest piece of the pieAccording to the e-Conomy SEA 2020 report by Google and Temasek, the Southeast Asian Internet economy will exceed USD 240 billion by 2025, which means that the size of the market gained in the next few years will be bigger than the whole market today.Around 350 million, or more than half, of the 600 million population in Southeast Asia are mobile internet users. The region also has one of the youngest demographics in the world, with over 50% of its population under the age of 30. Its young demographic and fast-growing economies are both conducive to the development of e-commerce, which, per the e-Conomy report, will reach USD 172 billion by 2025.Currently, the regions\u2019 e-commerce penetration rate is 38%, almost half of China\u2019s 67.7%, translating to much room for growth.Indonesia, on the other hand, as the most populous country in Southeast Asia, accounts for about 48% of the entire region\u2019s e-commerce market, with a size of USD 83 billion. The island country has always been the most important market across the region.In 2019, Tokopedia was the most visited e-commerce platform in Indonesia, but that strength didn\u2019t last long. Shopee, the e-commerce arm of Singapore\u2019s Sea group, managed to pull off a successful rise and doubled its gross merchandise value (GMV) to USD 35.4 billion in 2020, snatched up 57% of the total e-commerce market in Southeast Asia, and became the number one e-commerce player in the region.Industry insiders believe that the marriage of Tokopedia and Gojek can achieve synergies that would better position GoTo group in its competition against local rivals like Shopee.As Nitin Pangarkar, a professor at the business school of the National University of Singapore, puts it, \u201cEven though It\u2019s hard to make money out of transportation service, it leads to higher transaction frequency. Food delivery service, on the other hand, is much more profitable. The two services combined will lead to a high volume of user transactions that help hold users closely in a platform and bring up profit-making opportunities.\u201dInternet analysts believe that transportation, food delivery, and payment services are the three core pillars of \u201csuper apps.\u201d By having all three pillars under its belt through the merger, GoTo will also be able to fast-track its push to build the super app for Southeast Asia.The concept of super apps comes from China, where users just need one such app to do a wide array of things, from hailing a taxi, paying for a meal, keeping up with a friend, to booking a flight. From WeChat to Meituan, Chinese internet companies are obsessed with super apps. This obsession has found a new fandom in the region through the flow of Chinese venture capital to Southeast Asia.In addition to GoTo, Grab is the other regional force that\u2019s also trying to build a super app to some extent of success. The company in April announced its IPO plan via a SPAC (Special purpose acquisition company) merger with the technology-focused investment firm Altimeter Capital in the United States. The deal is expected to value Grab at USD 40 billion.GoTo is vying to reach a similar valuation. It plans to list in New York and Jakarta as early as this year, aiming for a valuation of between USD 35 and 40 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, more than double the combined valuation of Gojek and Tokopedia in their latest fundraising, respectively.On a separate note, Sea group is already listed on Nasdaq with a market capitalization of USD 128 billion in early March.In the shadows of giantsSea group is often referred to as the Tencent in Southeast Asia. One reason is that its founder Li Xiaodong had been very vocal in competing against Tencent when it started as a mobile gaming business named Garena; other than that, it modeled its business and corporate structure after Tencent. The company eventually got the attention and investment from Tencent in 2012, as well as a license to operate its popular \u201cLeague of Legends\u201d game in the Southeast Asian market.In 2017 Garena rebranded itself to Sea group while its gaming business retained the Garena name. Tencent and Sea furthered their tie-up as they entered into a long-term publishing partnership through which Sea was given the right of first refusal to publish Tencent\u2019s mobile and PC games in Indonesia, Taiwan, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Singapore.With its initial success in gaming, Sea launched its mobile wallet service SeaMoney in 2014 and then e-commerce platform Shopee in 2015 to compete against Gojek and Tokopedia on mobile payment and e-commerce.According to Sea\u2019s prospectus, Tencent holds 39.8% of Sea shares, while founder Li Xiaodong owns only 20.7%. To some industry observers, Tencent is the giant that stands behind Sea group.In a similar analog, Alibaba is the giant that stands behind GoTo. Alibaba and SoftBank are the only two investors with double-digit stakes in GoTo, ahead of others such as Google and Temasek (a Singaporean holding company). Back in August 2017, Alibaba invested exclusively in Tokopedia\u2019s USD 1.1 billion Series F funding, reportedly taking a stake of more than 40%. It then led a USD 1.1 billion Series G funding round in November 2018 with Masayoshi Son\u2019s SoftBank Vision Fund, becoming one of Tokopedia\u2019s major shareholders.The competition between Goto and Sea is starting to look like a proxy war between Alibaba and Tencent in Southeast Asia, which is a well-known narrative in the Chinese internet sector, especially after Alibaba\u2019s Lazada failed to catch up with Sea\u2019s Shopee.The GoTo group, by pooling resources from both Tokopedia and Gojek, now represents a more complete Alibaba ecosystem in the region, making it more of a forceful challenger to the other regional behemoths like Sea and Grab.This piece first appeared in the GeekPark.",

            "description": "Tencent\u2019s plan to reposition Weishi comes as the short-video app has fallen behind rivals Douyin and Kuaishou. Photo: VCGTencent Holdings Ltd. said it will reposition its Weishi app to focus on film and TV content, as the short-video platform struggles to win users in an increasingly saturated domestic market dominated by Douyin and Kuaishou.Weishi will pivot away from sharing user-uploaded videos and instead offer TV and movie clips, help to distribute Tencent\u2019s licensed content, and build a system to redistribute works by other creators, Sun Zhonghuai, the technology giant\u2019s vice president, said Monday at a press conference in Shanghai.The announcement comes after the Hong Kong-listed firm integrated Weishi and several other platform and content offerings into a new online video business unit headed by Sun, in an effort to enhance profitability and quality.Sun lambasted China\u2019s short-video culture at an industry forum last week, calling the clips \u201cincreasingly low-intellect and vulgar\u201d and comparing them to \u201cpig feed.\u201d People who watched the videos were \u201clike idiots,\u201d he said, adding that the ways such apps use algorithms to recommend similar clips to viewers was a style of \u201cbrainwashing\u201d that was coming under pressure from industry regulators and auditors.Tencent\u2019s internal shake-up is taking place as investors grow increasingly jittery over potential government clampdowns in China\u2019s technology sector. Tencent, which also operates the messaging app WeChat, has seen its share price drop by more than 20% since hitting a record high in February.Weishi has struggled to carve out a space in China\u2019s huge short-video market amid pressure from ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s Douyin \u2014 known as TikTok outside the country \u2014 and Kuaishou Technology\u2019s eponymous app.According to Quest Mobile, a Chinese research firm focusing on mobile technology, Weishi had fewer than 100 million monthly active users (MAUs) at the end of the first quarter. By comparison, industry leader Douyin said last year it had around 600 million MAUs, and Kuaishou has 520 million, according to its most recent earnings report.Speaking at an event to mark the 10th anniversary of Tencent Video, Sun said the formation of the company\u2019s online video unit was based on managerial-level considerations around resource allocation and changes in user behavior.\u201cIn the last two years, it\u2019s been difficult to please users with all the long videos or all the short videos in a single app,\u201d he said, adding that users increasingly expect to be able to see their favorite content on one platform.\u201cIn terms of TV and film works, they not only want to be able to watch features, but also want to see extra content derived from those series and to participate in deep discussions and communications with other fans,\u201d Sun said.Tencent set up the unit in December, Sun said. In addition to Weishi, it includes streaming service Tencent Video and its overseas twin WeTV, mobile app hosting service Yingyongbao, and Tencent Sports.Sun is the unit\u2019s CEO, while Lin Songtao is its chairman. Both report to Ren Yuxin, Tencent\u2019s chief operating officer and the chief of its platform and content group, as well as its interactive entertainment group.Since April, Tencent and other Chinese streaming giants like Youku Tudou Inc. and iQiyi Inc. have committed to tackling piracy on the country\u2019s short-video platforms, which have come under fire for hosting users that illegally clip or broadcast copyrighted material.Online platforms that host longer videos typically struggle to guarantee long-term returns on investment and high-quality content. Tencent Video made a loss of around 3 billion yuan ($470 million) in 2019, according to the company\u2019s financial reports. Rival iQiyi lost 10.3 billion yuan that year.Contact reporter Matthew Walsh (matthewwalsh@caixin.com) and editor Michael Bellart (michaelbellart@caixin.com)Download our app to receive breaking news alerts and read the news on the go.Get our weekly free Must-Read newsletter.",

Tier 4 is the highest level in the system.In a separate statement, Tencent Cloud said that the new data center in Tokyo will technically support Tencent\u2019s news, video streaming and social media platforms to display content related to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, which have been postponed to this summer due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Tencent Cloud has been accelerating its global expansion to grab a slice of the public cloud services market.

            "description": "BEIJING \u2014 Chinese competition regulators are considering a crackdown on Tencent Music Entertainment to bring the streaming giant down to size, but the company may already be losing its edge in the country\u2019s rapidly developing music market.Since its formation in 2016, TME has built its strength by relying on exclusive distribution deals with record labels and artists like Mandopop star Jay Chou to muscle out competition for the streaming services it owns. Lately, though, those arrangements have been unraveling even without the direct interference of regulators. In the past two years, Universal Music Group (UMG), Sony Music and Warner Music Group (WMG) have decided to diversify their distribution and leverage intensifying competition for better deals offered by companies like NetEase Cloud Music.If regulators act, TME could essentially be penalized for dominating the industry, despite the key role it played in shifting China\u2019s music business away from piracy and into licensed streaming. Over the past five years, China\u2019s recorded-music business has grown at an unparalleled pace: up 278% from $209.4 million in 2016 to $791.9 million in 2020, according to IFPI, with streaming accounting for 90.5% of last year\u2019s revenue.As of December, among China\u2019s top five streaming apps, TME\u2019s three platforms \u2014 QQ, Kuguo and Kuwo \u2014 controlled 77% of China\u2019s monthly active users, according to QuestMobile, a Chinese research company. And since TME went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2018, its market cap has grown from $21 billion to $26 billion.The company has also capitalized on listeners who do not use its services, sublicensing its exclusive distribution deals to its competitors for two to three times what it pays, NetEase CEO William Ding claimed publicly last year, while cutting major labels out of the market with direct artist deals like the one with Chou \u2014 for whose songs NetEase paid TME nearly $3 million to sublicense in 2018, according to court filings in China.Still, \u201cI really don\u2019t think we are dominating the market,\u201d counters Andy Ng, TME group vp. \u201cWe were just doing whatever we could to make the pie bigger so everybody could get a nice piece of it.\u201dNg says the perception that the company has overcharged competitors to sublicense content is unfair. He claims that NetEase is paying major labels more this year for nonexclusive distribution deals than TME charged it to sublicense the labels\u2019 content in 2020. (A NetEase representative declined to discuss terms but said that through the new direct arrangements, \u201cthe uncertainties of facing huge price increases proposed by third parties is now greatly reduced.\u201d)The Chinese competition authority has a history of targeting companies that it perceives are growing too dominant. Last year, it issued a record $2.8 billion fine against Alibaba Group Holding, before taking action in April against over a dozen other companies, including TME parent Tencent Holdings. The crackdown began after Alibaba founder Jack Ma said in a speech last October that the Communist government\u2019s \u201coutdated supervision\u201d of financial markets hamstrings innovation. But it broadly stems from China\u2019s desire to slow the rapid growth of its tech giants, which control reams of personal data and hold cultural sway, analysts say.Reuters has reported that regulators may fine TME 10 billion yuan ($1.54 billion) and force it to divest Kuguo and Kuwo, which would knock down TME\u2019s market share by about 68%, based on data from QuestMobile. Already, though, WMG\u2019s exclusive arrangement with TME expired in March and the companies announced they would form a joint label.China\u2019s competition authority opened an anti-trust investigation against TME\u2019s major-label exclusives in August of 2019. While that probe wound down the following February without penalties against Tencent, Universal rearranged its deal with TME, signing its first-ever distribution deal with NetEase Cloud Music last August. Sony Music followed suit in May with its own NetEase deal, while all three also renegotiated nonexclusive deals with TME.Related Warner Music Continues Major Label Asia Expansion With Whet RecordsThat should be good news for the Chinese music ecosystem, says Andy Mok, a senior research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, a Beijing think tank, who foresees more negotiating, deal-making and \u2014 ultimately \u2014 opportunity. \u201c[The labels\u2019] catalogs will be everywhere, more like the West,\u201d says Mok.NetEase Cloud Music \u2014 which applied May 26 to go public on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong and intends to raise $1 billion \u2014 could benefit most from regulatory action against TME. The app, part of video-game giant NetEase Inc., is a popular music curator for Generation Z consumers in larger, more affluent cities like Beijing and Shanghai than TME, which is stronger in lower-tier cities, label executives say.Analysts think that forced divestitures by TME could also usher a third major competitor into China\u2019s streaming market. That would likely be either Alibaba, which shut down its Xiami music app in February amid intense competition from Tencent, or TikTok owner ByteDance.Piracy-Ridden Market Spurred A Scramble For CopyrightsOnly a decade ago, more than 99% of music downloads in China were pirated, according to IFPI. But in 2011 China punished leading search engine Baidu for providing illegal mp3 downloads, and in 2012, seeing PSY\u2019s \u201cGangnam Style\u201d go viral, China sought the same success for its own domestic repertoire. Then in 2015 the government launched the \u201cSword Net\u201d initiative that ordered streaming platforms to take down unlicensed music. Within days, streamers removed more than 2.2 million songs.Tencent was ready to take advantage of the new music landscape. In late 2011 Ng, a Hong Kong native, joined Tencent\u2019s QQ Music from Nokia, where he had experience handling copyrights. He urged Tencent founder Pony Ma to focus on cleaning up the company\u2019s music rights issues and secure exclusive licensing deals, after Tencent\u2019s challenging experience with pirated video games.Entrepreneurs also sensed opportunity. In 2012, Xie Guomin, a lawyer who specialized in music copyrights, formed Ocean Music with a group of investors and set out to build a powerhouse digital distributor. At a time when licenses were cheap, Guomin hoarded copyrights and waited to make a fortune. By the end of 2013, Ocean Music had reached agreements with nearly 100 record companies and exclusive contracts with more than 40 music and copyright agencies \u2014 and had close to 20 million pieces of music in its library. The company also did the first exclusive deal with a major in China \u2014 for EMI\u2019s catalog.By 2016, Tencent had acquired China Music Corporation (the former Ocean Music) \u2014 which by that time had bought Kuguo and Kuwo \u2014 and renamed it Tencent Music Entertainment, solidifying its position as China\u2019s leading music streamer. That year Tencent also purchased Beijing music distributor R2G, which had been aggregating Chinese publishing rights since the early 2000s, when it won a string of lawsuits against Internet companies that provided music for mobile ring-back tones.In its zeal to sign exclusive deals, some competitors say, TME routinely overpaid for its deals with the majors, which involve minimum guarantees. (Ng says the prices were in line with projections of streaming users.) With the large up-front advances, royalty reporting was almost an afterthought, frustrating artists and managers \u2014 something that will improve as the market moves away from exclusive deals, says Alex Taggart, head of international for label services firm Outdustry, which last year formed an independent publishing company specializing in China.\u201cWe learned the best way to get better reporting out of everybody is to play them off against each other,\u201d Taggart says. (Ng says TME issues monthly reports and is working on a system for real-time reporting that will more closely match global standards.)The TME exec says NetEase\u2019s planned initial public offering illustrates how rapidly the music landscape is changing. \u201cI\u2019m sure there will be more competitors coming in the future,\u201d Ng says. \u201cEverybody is still talking about how the China music industry is doing great. Everybody is still trying to jump in.\u201dA version of this article originally appeared in the June 5, 2021 issue of Billboard.",

It told Caixin it will make its lawsuit public at the proper time.The newly amended law is part of ongoing efforts by Chinese regulators to protect minors from gaming addictions, overspending and access to in-game material they consider unhealthy.Since its launch in 2015, Honor of Kings has become one of Tencent\u2019s highest-earning mobile games. It raked in $258.8 million in April, up 38.4% year-on-year, retaining its position as the world\u2019s highest-grossing mobile game for two consecutive months, according to SensorTower.Contact reporter Ding Yi (yiding@caixin.com) and editor Heather Mowbray (heathermowbray@caixin.com)Related: Exclusive: Tencent Venture Wins License to Offer Reinsurance in Hong Kong",

            "description": "When it transpired in 2016 that Splash Damage had been acquired by a Chinese poultry firm, the headline raised more than a few eyebrows.But it turned out that Leyou had more than one ace up its sleeve. The company already owned a majority stake in Warframe developer Digital Extremes and went to buy 20% of Texas-based studio Certain Affinity the next year.Leyou initially expanded into games to \"mitigate the volatile and cyclical nature of the poultry business,\" but it soon became clear that it was a force to be reckoned with. It even struck a deal with Amazon for its now defunct Lord of the Rings MMO.And, like all things successful in games, that means it attracted Tencent's attention. Reports of parties interested in acquiring Leyou emerged in July 2020, with Sony even reportedly considering a bid at the time. Leyou confirmed in September that Tencent was in the running for its acquisition, before the takeover was approved in December for a substantial $1.5 billion.\"For us, it's impossible to ignore just what being backed by Tencent offers a studio like ours. It's felt like having the cheat codes for game development\"Both Digital Extremes and Splash Damage were prompt to react and point out that they were going to retain their independence despite changing hands. In a blog post published at the time, Splash Damage co-founder and CEO Richard Jolly teased exciting prospects for the company, but it's been radio silence ever since.\"For us, it's impossible to ignore just what being backed by Tencent offers a studio like ours,\" he now tells GamesIndustry.biz. \"People tend to forget that Tencent is the largest company in the world when it comes to video games. This not only provides us stability, but also access to a whole bunch of experience and resources that help us make better games for our players. It's really felt a little bit like having the cheat codes for game development.\"Looking ahead, we've got some very ambitious plans for our next decade that we had already started on before the acquisition. Now, we're able to accelerate those. As one of the founders of the studio, I can honestly say that this is the most excited I've ever been for where we're headed.\"Outcasters released on Google Stadia in December 2020Jolly believes it's Splash Damage's extensive experience as multiplayer developers that initially caught Tencent's attention. \"If you can get complete strangers to work together online, magical things happen,\" he says.Splash Damage released Outcasters late last year, a title that leveraged its decades of expertise in competitive online shooters, having previously worked on the likes of Brink, and the Quake and Wolfenstein franchises.It was also the studio's first original IP since Dirty Bomb, which Splash Damage stopped developing only two months after launch back in 2018. But having the support of Tencent will allow the studio to bolster its efforts on the original IP front, Jolly continues.\"Without a doubt the biggest shift is that this has accelerated our transition from traditional work-for-hire to projects where we have true ownership. This has always been our goal as a studio and we're able to get there a lot faster now.\"Without a doubt the biggest shift is that this has accelerated our transition from traditional work-for-hire to projects where we have true ownership\"\"This also means publishing and operating our own games and having that direct relationship with our community of players. Splash Damage was started by three friends who met online playing Quake competitively, so this is especially meaningful to us. This is all very different from work-for-hire where you're ultimately beholden to an external customer. We're currently expanding our studio with additional divisions to take full advantage of the ownership and stability we now have.\"We've always wanted to create more original IP and that's absolutely going to be a greater focus for us now. We also have a successful history of working with licensed IP, and we expect that to continue. It really comes down to what's right for the experience we're building.\"Jolly adds that the studio has had self-funded projects for many years now, but they often \"needed to take a backseat to [its] work-for-hire projects as those were paying most of the bills.\" Before the Tencent acquisition, Splash Damage had already begun scaling back its focus on the traditional work-for-hire business.\"While we gained a lot of experience supporting other people's games, we really wanted to take the studio back to a place where we have true ownership of what we're creating. That's not to say we won't partner with other companies from here on, but we can now be far more selective about who we team up with. For example, we only tend to look for partners who are experts in their field and that we can learn from. It's also very important for us that they share our values when it comes to the games we create, and how we treat staff and our players.\"Splash Damage is approaching 400 staff and the studio is also 'actively looking outward to see how [it] can help smaller studios by having them join the Splash Damage family'Tencent -- which we dubbed the industry's \"silent giant\" back in 2016 -- has the reputation of being quite hands-off as a partner, and Jolly is keen to highlight that this is exactly the type of relationship that suits Splash Damage.\"After starting out as a mod team in the late '90s, Splash Damage was independently owned for many years, and we've always had to be entrepreneurial to survive in what's always been a very competitive industry. Like so many other independent studios, we certainly faced our share of challenges along the way.\"Being part of the Tencent family now absolutely plays to our strengths in that regard: they trust us to do what's right for our studio and the games we're working on, and we get to take advantage of their vast expertise, global reach, and resources to help us [reach] our full potential.\"Tencent has had a very aggressive M&A strategy for the past few years. In 2020 only, the Chinese company invested in 31 companies in the games industry. And Jolly is not closed to the idea of collaborating with one of the numerous Tencent studios scattered across the world.\"We are now also at a point where we are actively looking outward to see how we can help smaller studios by having them join the Splash Damage family\"\"We're big fans of so many of the games created by the studios in the Tencent family, so this is a very interesting question,\" Jolly says when asked about Splash Damage's interest in mix and matching properties across Tencent studios. \"It's certainly a possibility if it's right for the game. Right now, we're focusing on sharing learnings to help all of us become better at what we do.\"While the money from the acquisition went directly to Leyou's shareholders, Jolly says, changing hands did accelerate things on the recruitment side, with the studio also looking to expand beyond its original location.\"Our London studio is currently rapidly approaching 400 incredibly talented people, and we have more joining us every week. We've got more open roles than ever before. These pretty much cover all disciplines and seniority levels, so there's something there for everyone. We'll also be looking to establish additional development studios at other locations in the months and years to come.\"Jolly also hints at the possibility for Splash Damage to acquire other studios, adding that the company will have more to say on the topic later this year.\"We are now also at a point where we are actively looking outward to see how we can help smaller studios by having them join the Splash Damage family and sharing with them what we've learned over the past 20 years.\"Splash Damage's London headquarters -- the company is looking to establish additional development studios 'in the months and years to come'When asked about the current consolidation trend -- whether it's from Tencent, Embracer Group or Microsoft -- that is creating big groups within the industry, Jolly doesn't believe it represents a threat to independent development but rather sees it as an opportunity.\"I can certainly understand why on the face of it people might be worried, but I think it's a more nuanced situation than it seems,\" he says. \"Splash Damage spent many years as an independent developer since we started the studio all the way back in 2001, so I can certainly empathise with the struggles faced by them.\"It feels like every few years, there's a story about how indie development is dying off\"\"It feels like every few years, there's a story about how indie development is dying off. In fact, independent game development is thriving, and we've seen the rise of the indie publisher really cemented within the industry. This year alone we've seen breakout successes like Valheim and Loop Hero, and that kind of amazing creativity is not going anywhere. The main issue that many of these titles have is discoverability, which I suppose is another conversation entirely.\"Overall, I believe that this kind of investment can unlock the true potential of studios and creators if they're empowered to focus on making great games. The other important thing to consider here is that it doesn't lock these games into a specific ecosystem, which is obviously great for players.\"In the case of Splash Damage specifically, it does look like being acquired has been a chance to unlock its true potential. Jolly says the studio is now very different from what it was just a year ago, with far more stability and control.\"We've got several ambitious projects where our teams have true ownership. We're going to be publishing and operating our own games. We've got an amazing amount of talent and we're still growing considerably, including our largest-ever intake of entry level roles to support the next generation.\"This truly is the next chapter of our story. It's a fantastic opportunity to join our studio and help us take Splash Damage into the future.\"",

            "description": "Beijing (AFP) \u2013Advertising Read moreTwo men exchange longing glances, a frisson of sexual tension in an on-screen relationship which must otherwise go unspoken -- China's \"boys' love\" phenomenon is gripping video streamers, slipping by censors of LGBTQ themes with their subtlety.The genre rose to prominence in 2018, as adaptations of web novels about same-sex couples, known as \"dangaiju\", were increasingly picked up by on-demand services, propelling Chinese actors to stardom.In \"Word of Honor\", a blockbusting adventure from video platform Youku, two handsome martial arts heroes develop a close bond, but refer to each other only as \"brothers\" as the heavily-insinuated romance between protagonists fails to emerge.Although China decriminalised homosexuality in 1997, same-sex marriage is illegal and taboo trails LGBTQ issues.The community is facing renewed pressure, with web content censored and depictions of gay romance in films banned.Yet \"boys' love\" adaptations are booming, screened by streaming giants like Youku and Tencent Video, mostly fuelled by demand from straight women and their growing interest in a more delicate form of masculinity.Tickets for a Word of Honor themed concert in Suzhou sold out in seconds earlier this month, as hundreds of thousands rushed for a spot.The series quickly racked up millions of views after it was released in February, while Tencent Video reportedly made 156 million yuan ($24.1 million) from advance viewings of a similar show.For video platforms in China's boisterous, hyper-competitive streaming sphere, changing social mores means one thing: money.\"In pop culture, creators look to subcultures for new stories or original material,\" said Liaoning University lecturer Bai Meijiadai, an expert in fan culture.\"The rise of 'boys' love' content suggests the on-screen industry is aware of young women's consumption power.\"- 'They break the mould' -The red pen of the state may have supported the video phenomenon.Authorities have cracked down on \"illegal\" writing on the web, censoring content deemed too risque for Chinese readers. In 2018 a novelist was sentenced to 10 years' jail for writing and selling \"pornographic\" books.\"Sexual content in (same-sex) web novels has reduced since authorities embarked on cyberspace clean-ups and platforms introduced review-and-report mechanisms,\" said Bai.This makes their storylines -- many of grand, period adventures flecked with martial arts -- easier to adapt for television, with more sexually explicit content removed, she added.Around 60 TV adaptations are now underway.But the genre attracts mixed reviews among China's queer communities.\"They break the mould of heterosexual relationships being the norm on screen,\" said a gay civil society worker who wanted to be known only as Shuai.\"But they do not reflect the LGBT community's struggles and difficulties.\"Once lead actors attain fame, they also avoid suggestions of gay identity to maintain popularity, he added, doing little to counter the airbrushing out of LGBTQ lives.- Appeal to women -The television adaptations mainly appeal to women.An e-commerce worker surnamed Xu said \"boys' love\" allowed her a precious escape, unlike many other TV shows in China which serve a barrage of stereotypes in their depictions of women's gender roles.\"It allows me to think about fewer things and relax,\" the 29-year-old added.Handsome boyish young men, including those from the TV serials, have also become a preferred fantasy love interest.\"That's been influenced by boyband success from South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, since even the 1980s,\" said Derek Hird, a senior lecturer in Chinese Studies at Lancaster University.To surf the wave of popularity more people -- mostly amateur scribes -- are writing \"boys' love\" stories for web in the hope they may be adapted for TV.While authors are mostly part-timers who write for spare cash, \"popular writers can earn more than 10,000 yuan a month via subscriptions and rewards from readers\", said a fiction editor who gave her name only as Chu.Up to 40 million yuan was paid for rights to a novel in the genre, official periodical Banyuetan said.Experts say the genre could prove useful to China's soft power ambitions.The country so far lacks a breakout entertainment product matching the global popularity of South Korea's entertainment industry or Japan's anime and manga.Martial arts and period dramas are \"really marketable aspects for China,\" said Hird.But there is tension between explorations on gender and the \"fear of a masculinity crisis\", he added.In January, China's education ministry pledged to improve physical education and \"pay more attention to cultivating\" masculinity.For now, the \"boys' love\" industry has steered clear of regulators through subtle portrayals of same-sex moments or \"normalising\" shows' endings.\"For example, you may have deviations in your teenage years, but once you grow up, you still go back to reproductive 'normalcy',\" explained Bai of Liaoning University.\u00a9 2021 AFP",

            "description": "One of the companies that created the technical specifications for the China Advertising ID (CAID) was acquired last month by Chinese mobile ad tech company Mobvista.One can think of Reyun, which helped developed the code for CAID on behalf of the state-backed China Advertising Association (and whose name in Chinese \u2013 \u70ed\u4e91\u6570\u636e \u2013 roughly translates to \u201cHot Cloud Data\u201d), as the equivalent of third-party mobile measurement firm Adjust, but specifically focused on the China market.Adjust was itself recently acquired by AppLovin in a deal worth $1 billion. Mobvista snagged the Beijing-based Reyun for 1.5 billion RMB, or just more than $233 million. It\u2019s planning to use Reyun\u2019s mobile measurement tech to help developers outside of China grow their apps in the massive China market.As a refresher, CAID is a stand-in for the IDFA that was designed to circumvent Apple\u2019s AppTrackingTransparency framework on iOS 14.The technology gathers a bunch of different non-distributed metadata, aka data that lives on a device (country, time zone, language, device name, physical memory, etc.) and assembles it to generate an ID that isn\u2019t deterministic but is adequate enough to be used for ad measurement.If that sounds like fingerprinting, that\u2019s because it pretty much is. And Apple\u2019s ATT privacy framework explicitly prohibits fingerprinting.The FT broke the news of CAID\u2019s existence in March. Although Apple didn\u2019t comment on CAID specifically, it did say in a statement that \u201cthe App Store terms and guidelines apply equally to all developers around the world\u201d and \u201capps that are found the disregard the user\u2019s choice will be rejected.\u201dAlthough some developers and even advertisers had started testing CAID as of March \u2013 including P&G, TikTok parent company ByteDance and Tencent \u2013 anyone using CAID as a replacement for the IDFA is in for a rude awakening, said Clement Cao, CEO and co-founder of Mobvista.\u201cIf you use CAID SDK data and Apple sees, you\u2019ll receive an email from Apple and be removed from the App Store,\u201d he said.The same is true of any related technology. And yet some companies seem to have an appetite for risk. Although no one will say publicly that it\u2019s tracking users across different applications on the server side, it\u2019s very likely happening, Cao said.\u201cCompanies have their own solutions, but this kind of calculated server-side technology cannot be used in the long term,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone, including every big platform, including us, are only able to optimize based on the aggregated data that comes from SKAdNetwork postbacks.\u201dMobvista\u2019s rationale for acquiring the company, Cao said, is to help make the Chinese market more accessible to overseas developers that aren\u2019t familiar with its idiosyncrasies.\u201cIt\u2019s a very different mobile ecosystem in China, but it\u2019s one of the most important markets,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if developers want to be successful in China, they need a localized solution.\u201dStory updated to reflect that multiple companies were involved in developing the CAID spec.",

Tencent did not comment then.The action against Tencent came amid a sweeping anti-trust clampdown by China on its internet giants.\"In recent months, we have received increased regulatory scrutiny from relevant authorities, and have been actively co-operating and communicating with the relevant regulators,\" Tony Yip, chief strategy officer of Tencent Music, told an earnings conference call.Yip declined to comment further or predict the outcome of the talks with the regulators, but said \"we are committed to comply with all relevant laws and regulations, including those related to anti-trust.\"On Monday, Sony Music Entertainment announced digital distribution agreements with both Tencent Music and NetEase Cloud Music, ending an exclusive arrangement with Tencent Music.News of the regulatory scrutiny has pressured Tencent group shares over the past month, with Tencent Music down more than 14%.Tencent Music beat quarterly profit and revenue estimates on Monday, driven by strong growth in subscription and advertising revenue from its music streaming platform. But its monthly active users numbers fell.The company, known as China's Spotify (SPOT.N), has been expanding its music library through new partnerships and multi-year licensing deals. That, coupled with efforts to diversify its content base through long-form shows and live talk shows have helped lure more paying users as well as advertisers.Although paying users for its music platform jumped, monthly active users (MAUs) for both music and social entertainment platforms declined by 6.4% and 14.2%, respectively.\"Users have stopped growing in general; last year was a high base due to the COVID,\" said Tian Hou, analyst at T.H. Capital Research.Profit attributable to equity holders of Tencent Music rose to 926 million yuan ($143.94 million) in the quarter from 887 million yuan a year earlier.Excluding items, the company earned 69 yuan per American Depository Share (ADS), above estimates of 55 yuan per ADS.Revenue rose 24% to 7.82 billion yuan, while analysts were expecting 7.73 billion yuan, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.($1 = 6.4333 Chinese yuan renminbi)Reporting by Tiyashi Datta and Eva Mathews in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini GanguliOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

That was an increase of 65% on the comparable period last year when coronavirus was at its peak in China. It was a 19% decrease from the fourth quarter of 2020.Revenues in the January to March period were up by 25% to RMB135 billion ($20.9 billion) year-on-year, but only 1% higher than the final quarter of last year.The company achieved \u201cnotable growth for business services as well as online advertising revenue streams, while stepping up investment in areas including business services and enterprise software, high-production-value games, and short-form video,\u201d according to management.Its gigantic portfolio of share stakes in unlisted start-ups and listed operating companies delivered more mixed results. \u201cOur listed investment portfolio experienced meaningful value appreciation, while contributing mixed results to our associate income, with certain investees delivering wider associate losses due to their investments in new initiatives such as community group buying activities,\u201d the company said.Tencent\u2019s regulatory filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange made no mention of regulatory issues or penalties, though the fear of increased scrutiny of China\u2019s internet sector has recently wiped some $200 billion from the value of Chinese tech stocks. It has been rumored that, following a $2.8 billion fine for rival Alibaba, Tencent could face penalty of perhaps $1.5 billion for monopolistic practices.In the absence of that, Tencent reported upward business as usual trends. Subscriptions to value added services increased by 14% across video, music streaming and other products. That points to the company being able to hold on to gains made early last year when lockdowns and work-from-home conditions artificially favored digital services.Tencent said that it now has 125 million subscribers for its streaming video services, an increase of 12% year-on-year. Although like for like comparisons of subscription numbers can be tricky, that points to clear daylight between Tencent Video and nearest rival iQIYI, which earlier this week reported 105 million subscribers (excluding trials).

I owned both stocks at the time, but I declared that Tencent's better diversification, lower exposure to the pandemic, and stronger growth rates all made it a more compelling buy than Apple.But over the past 12 months, Tencent's stock advanced less than 40% as Apple's stock rallied nearly 60%. I also sold my position in Tencent earlier this year but held on to my shares of Apple.Let's see why Apple outperformed Tencent, how several recent developments dampened my enthusiasm for the Chinese tech giant, and if Apple will remain the stronger investment over the next 12 months.Tencent's growth masks some serious challengesTencent initially seems like a great growth stock. It owns WeChat, China's top messaging platform and a walled ecosystem for millions of Mini Programs -- which enable users to play games, make payments, buy things, hail rides, and more without ever leaving the app.It's the largest video game publisher in the world, and its online payment platform WeChat Pay shares a near duopoly in its market with Ant Group's AliPay in China. It owns Tencent Video, one of China's top streaming video platforms, most of Tencent Music (TME), the country's largest streaming music platform; and Tencent Cloud, its third largest cloud platform after Alibaba (BABA -1.02%) Cloud and Huawei Cloud.But that's not all. It's also on the verge of merging Huya (HUYA -5.34%) and Douyu (DOYU -4.45%), China's two largest esports streaming platforms; it owns a long list of smaller apps, and its investment portfolio reaches far beyond its home market.Tencent's revenue rose 28% in 2020 -- as its value-added services, advertising, and fintech and business services all generated double-digit sales growth -- and its adjusted earnings rose 30%. Analysts expect its revenue to rise 21% and 27%, respectively, this year.Those growth rates are impressive, but three things are dragging down the stock. First, Chinese regulators targeted Tencent over the past year with fines over previously unapproved acquisitions, tighter scrutiny of its upcoming deals, and threats of tighter regulations for its fintech business.Second, it faces unpredictable regulatory threats in the U.S., where a newly passed law could force Tencent's unsponsored ADR shares off the OTC market if it doesn't comply with new auditing rules within the next three years. U.S. regulators are also reportedly probing its stakes in Riot Games and Epic Games. If Tencent is forced to divest those big investments, its gaming revenues could plunge.Lastly, rising bond yields are sparking a rotation from growth to value stocks. That sell-off reduced Tencent's forward P/E ratio to 25, but the recent regulatory headwinds could keep the bulls at bay.Apple has a clearer path forwardApple's revenue and earnings rose 6% and 10%, respectively, in fiscal 2020, which ended last September. It mainly relied on higher revenues from its Macs, iPads, Apple Watches, AirPods, and software services to offset its 3% decline in iPhone sales.But in the first half of fiscal 2021, Apple's revenue surged 34% year over year. Its iPhone sales jumped 34%, thanks to robust demand for the iPhone 12 (its first family of 5G devices), as all of its other business segments generated high double-digit sales growth.Apple's services segment, which includes Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, and other services, also surpassed 600 million paid subscribers late last year. The growth of that ecosystem will continue to lock in users while planting the seeds for future growth initiatives like augmented reality and connected cars.Apple's earnings grew 63% year over year in the first six months, even as it ramped up its investments in new services. It expects the global chip shortage to reduce its revenues by up to $4 billion in the third quarter, mainly due to its impact on Mac and iPad shipments, but that would only account for about 1% of its estimated revenues for the full year.Wall Street expects Apple's revenue and earnings to grow 29% and 59%, respectively, this year. The stock trades at 24 times forward earnings, and it arguably faces fewer near-term challenges than Tencent.That said, Apple still faces a few unresolved conflicts, including legal challenges against its App Store fees, clashes with advertisers over its recent privacy changes to iOS, and antitrust probes in the U.S. and Europe.Apple also remains heavily dependent on the iPhone, which still generated over half its revenues in the first half of the year. But with $204 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on hand, Apple can still easily expand beyond the iPhone with big investments and acquisitions.The bottom lineI sold Tencent because it was becoming the next big antitrust target in China after Alibaba. It's also attracting too much attention from U.S. regulators.Meanwhile, Apple started a fresh growth cycle with the iPhone 12, and its other businesses continue to expand as it returns most of its free cash flow to investors via buybacks and dividends. Therefore, I'm sticking with Apple and backing away from big Chinese tech stocks like Tencent this year.",

            "description": "Chinese short video and livestreaming app Douyin is appealing in a lawsuit with Tencent over a copyright dispute related to game livestreaming, its parent ByteDance confirmed with KrASIA this week. The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court ruled late April that Douyin violated Tencent\u2019s copyright of the \u201ccontinuous images\u201d generated in Honor of Kings and was ordered to pay RMB 8 million (USD 1.2 million) in compensation.The lawsuit dates back to 2018 when Tencent, which operates its own game livestreaming platform eGame, found that rival Huoshan, run by Douyin, was openly recruiting players to livestream Honor of Kings, providing the recording software, and promising a cut of the revenue from viewer tips. Terms and conditions of the game prohibit livestreaming, among other commercial usage.Douyin argued that Tencent has been encouraging gamers to broadcast or distribute videos of their gameplay on various platforms since 2016, offering cash rewards or traffic support, and that the clause that bans users from livestreaming was buried deep in the 37-page user agreement. The defendant further stated that livestreaming without the publisher\u2019s authorization is a common practice and that players should own the rights of broadcasts that showcase their own strategies and skills in the game.To support its argument, Douyin cited an announcement Tencent made in June 2018. Tencent asked contestants to submit videos where gamers speak about their gameplay, saying that it \u201conly had the right for usage\u201d of the videos. That would indicate that Tencent agreed that players contribute \u201ccreative efforts\u201d and thus own the copyright as a new form of production independent from the game itself, Douyin said.There is no certain answer to whether all livestreams can be viewed as \u201cnew productions,\u201d as there are various forms, said the court. Regarding the recordings provided by Tencent as evidence, the court remarked that these materials could not be viewed as new productions as the players\u2019 additions, such as their narration, were \u201crather simple and lacked creativity.\u201d Douyin did not submit sufficient evidence to support the contrary, and even if it could, the usage cannot infringe upon the plaintiff\u2019s copyright of the original game product, the court added.Although livestreaming, as a new form of communication, is not part of any category listed in Chinese copyright law, the court ruled that Tencent has the right to control livestreaming that involve its games, citing the WIPO Copyright Treaty that China joined in 2006.The court also ruled that Douyin was at fault for \u201cinducing, encouraging, and organizing\u201d internet users to livestream the plaintiff\u2019s game, even after Tencent contacted Huoshan to demand cessation of the practice. These livestreams were not solely planned and executed by the players, and Douyin did profit from them, the court added.\u201cViewing the current legal framework, it\u2019s no problem for the court to rule against Douyin, confirming the infringement in its role as an instigator,\u201d commented Zhao Baodong, a lawyer with Beijing DHH Law Firm. However, the court did not rule on the copyright ownership of gameplay livestreaming in general, Zhao added, expecting the problem to be addressed in future legislation.A streamer who goes by the name of Wu told KrASIA that if a platform permits users to livestream gameplay, then it should have acquired the relevant rights to host the streams. But who owns the final product? \u201cIf I create the effects, then I should have the copyright,\u201d Wu said.",

            "description": "Tencent Holdings Ltd. (00700.HK) reshuffled its cloud services and industrial internet arm after senior executives were left unsatisfied with its performance last year, according to people familiar with the matter.The Hong Kong-listed company\u2019s Cloud & Smart Industries Group (CSIG) said Friday that Tang Daosheng had left his role as its president to become its CEO.Additionally, Qiu Yuepeng, the president of CSIG subsidiary Tencent Cloud, has taken on the extra role of the group\u2019s chief operating officer, reporting directly to Tang on sales, quality and operational matters, CSIG said.Tencent bigwigs discussed the reshuffle after Tencent Cloud missed growth expectations in 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic forced many companies to conduct more business online, two people close to the company told Caixin.The unit\u2019s rivals have prospered during the pandemic, with Huawei Cloud overhauling it in the fourth quarter last year to become China\u2019s second-largest such service behind Alibaba Cloud, according to market research firm IDC.Huawei Cloud\u2019s surge is particularly galling for Tencent given that the controversial telecoms giant only entered the public cloud services sector in 2017, four years after Tencent.Tencent\u2019s financial reports have repeatedly stressed that the coronavirus outbreaks caused delays to its cloud projects, complicated new project signings and forced it to make one-off adjustments to infrastructure-as-a-service contracts.Tencent Cloud said the switch-up marked another significant change since the CSIG was established in 2018 amid a broader company-wide restructuring.The pandemic had sped up the arrival of the \u201cage of full digitization\u201d and made Tencent \u201ceven more steadfast in its strategic direction for the industrial internet,\u201d Tang said.The personnel changes aimed to deepen the company\u2019s presence in the industry and improve efficiency, he added.Tencent is expected to announce its quarterly earnings on Monday.Contact reporter Matthew Walsh (matthewwalsh@caixin.com) and editor Lu Zhenhua (zhenhualu@caixin.com)Download our app to receive breaking news alerts and read the news on the go.Get our weekly free Must-Read newsletter.",

Prosus has a market capitalisation of 138 billion euros and Naspers of 80 billion euros.Van Dijk said Prosus shareholders would benefit as Naspers shares are more deeply discounted. Prosus trades at a 20% discount, and Naspers at a 35% discount, relative to their economic interests in the Tencent stake.DOMINANCENaspers has struggled with its relative dominance on the Johannesburg exchange and its shareholders have long lobbied for the company to reduce the valuation gap. read moreThe deal would address those issues, Van Dijk said, and he predicted the offer, which is voluntary, would be fully subscribed.Naspers will remain the largest company on the Johannesburg stock exchange, but will see its weighting on the exchange's leading share index fall to 14% from 23%.The deal will increase Prosus's float on the Euronext stock exchange to around 42.8%, from 27% at present, making it eligible for inclusion among indexes of Europe's largest companies.Analysts and fund managers welcomed the move.Peter Takaendesa, head of equities at Mergence Investment Managers, said while the move is a \u201cdecent solution\u201d it might not be enough to close the valuation gap, and suggested selling the Tencent stake down would be more direct.Shares in Prosus rose 1.8% to 86.30 euros in Amsterdam while Naspers shares rose 2.6% to 325.67 rand in Johannesburg by 0803GMT.Last month Prosus sold 2% of Tencent for $14.7 billion, in one of its largest strategic moves since its 2019 public listing in Amsterdam. Van Dijk repeated Wednesday the stake will not be further reduced for 3 years. read moreThe companies said they expect the share deal to be implemented in the third quarter of 2021.($1 = 0.8247 euros)Reporting by Toby Sterling; editing by Jason NeelyOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

According to previous reports from Beijing Daily and other media outlets, many apps try to lure middle-aged and elderly users to browse their pages by offering cash rewards.(Source: Pianduoduo)Capped at 3,600 coins per day, for a total monetary value of 0.2 yuan, users can earn 60 coins for every minute they watch, which can be quite appealing for people with spare time. Users can watch videos in landscape mode without being distracted by recommendations, small posters and advertisements.It is also important to note that the growth of ultra-fast versions of short video apps, such as Douyin and Kuaishou, poses a threat to Tencent Video.According to the financial report of Tencent Holdings in 2020, the number of paying users of Tencent Video has reached 123 million. However, its financial report for that year showed that Tencent Video suffered a loss of nearly 3 billion yuan ($465 million), perhaps because of its high cost, single operation mode, loss of members and less original and high-quality content, analysts noted.Pianduoduo can be regarded as an ultra-fast version of Tencent Video. By removing unnecessary modules, the app is suitable for people who do not have high demands in terms of phone configuration and pursue simple user interfaces.SEE ALSO: ByteDance Said to Consider IPO for Douyin in Hong Kong or New York, Increasing Its Valuation to Nearly $400 BillionBeing familiar with the tactic of attracting more users by offering rewards, Chinese netizens are wondering whether this service, too, will charge membership fees in the future.",

            "description": "China is preparing to hit Tencent Holding Ltd. with a fine of at least $1.54 billion (RMB10 billion) as part of a larger antitrust crackdown on its major internet firms, according to a report in Reuters. That sum would be large enough to serve as a strong warning to the industry, but less than the record $2.75 billion penalty fine slapped on Alibaba earlier this month.China\u2019s State Administration of of Market Regulation (SAMR) is investigating Tencent for anticompetitive practices, probing its music-streaming business and Tencent Music Entertainment Group (TME) in particular, according to the report. The conglomerate also faces fines for not properly reporting past acquisitions and investment for antitrust reviews, each case of which can yield a fine of up to RMB500,000 ($77,000).\u201cThe attitude from the regulator is that, unlike Alibaba, you are not the biggest target here, but it would be impossible not to penalize Tencent now that the campaign is in action,\u201d Reuters cited one of its sources as saying.Tencent and Alibaba Group are China\u2019s two biggest tech giants, with market values of $776 billion and $642 billion, respectively. Tencent is involved in a wide array of entertainment sector businesses, its core sectors of video games and social media to content production, video streaming, and music.Although Tencent\u2019s main video game and social media businesses may come out of the probe unscathed, the company will likely be asked to give up its exclusive music rights and possibly even forced to sell its Kuwo and Kugou music apps, Reuters said.TME spun off and listed separately in the U.S. in 2018, and currently has a market cap of $32 billlion. Its music apps include QQ Music, the online karaoke platform WeSing, and rival streamers Kuwo and Kugou, which it acquired in 2016. Its biggest local competitor is NetEase Cloud Music, given that its other rival, Xiami Music, shuttered in February. It also owns stakes in two of the three major labels as well as the world\u2019s largest music subscription service: 20% of Universal Music Group, around 9% of Spotify and a $200 million stake in Warner Music Group.For years, TME kept a strangehold on the rights to major catalogues in China by signing exclusive streaming contracts with Universal, Warner and the third major, Sony. Portions of those rights are then sub-licensed to other competing streamers, who continue to rail that the set-up is unfair and forces them to pay much higher prices than they should.A 2018 SAMR investigation led Tencent to drop some of its exclusive rights contracts at the end of their three-year duration; the probe was suspended in 2019. Tencent has made good on those commitments, signing new contracts over the past year with Universal and Warner that do not include exclusive sub-licensing rights. Last year, rival NetEase for the first time signed a deal to directly license songs from Universal, chipping away at Tencent\u2019s iron grip on China\u2019s music market.Now, however, Tencent may be asked to give up even more of its exclusive rights \u2014 such as those to the catalogue of Jay Chou, the world\u2019s biggest Chinese language pop star, Reuters said. At the moment, Tencent is fighting for better terms as it awaits the Chinese authorities\u2019 final say-so.\u201cTencent doesn\u2019t mind paying a hefty fine and is willing to pay more if it needs to, as long as its core businesses [of video games and WeChat] remain intact,\u201d a Reuters source said.The Chinese government has grown increasingly worried about the influence of its powerful and data-rich tech giants. In recent weeks, China gave 34 of its biggest tech firms, including Tencent, a month to correct any anti-competitive business practices. Earlier this week, SAMR said it would investigate the Tencent-backed food delivery company Meituan for potentially forcing clients to use its platform exclusively.Tencent may also be required to heed certain concessions, such as giving up exclusive rights to broadcast games in order to go ahead with a planned merger of top video game streaming platforms Huya and Douyu.",

            "description": "The website for \"League of Legends\" a game developed by Riot Games, a subsidiary of Tencent, is displayed. Brent Lewin | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTencent Holdings is negotiating agreements with a U.S. national security panel that would allow it to keep its ownership stakes in U.S. video game developers Riot Games and Epic Games, according to people familiar with the matter. Tencent has been in talks with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which has the authority to order the Chinese technology giant to divest U.S. holdings, since the second half of last year, the sources said. CFIUS has been looking in to whether Epic Games' and Riot Games' handling of the personal data of their users constitutes a national security risk because of their Chinese ownership, the sources added. Tencent owns a 40% stake in Epic Games, the maker of popular video game Fortnite. Tencent also bought a majority stake in Riot Games in 2011 and acquired the rest of the company in 2015. Riot Games is the developer of \"League of Legends,\" one of the world's most popular desktop-based games.Tencent is negotiating risk-mitigation measures with CFIUS so it can keep its investments, according to the sources. The details of the proposed measures could not be learned. They typically involve ringfencing the owner of a company from operations that have national security implications. They often call for the appointment of independent auditors to monitor the implementation of these agreements. One of the sources said Epic Games has not been sharing any user data with Tencent. The sources cautioned there is no certainty that Tencent will clinch deals to keep its investments and asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Tencent, Epic Games and a CFIUS representative at the U.S. Treasury Department declined to comment. A Riot Games spokesman said the Los Angeles-based company operates independently of Tencent and that it has implemented \"industry-leading practices\" to protect player data. He declined to comment on Riot Games' discussions with CFIUS. CFIUS has been cracking down on Chinese ownership of U.S. technology assets in the last few years, amid an escalation in tensions between Washington and Beijing over trade, human rights and the protection of intellectual property. U.S. officials have expressed concerns that the personal data of U.S. citizens could end up in the hands of China's Communist Party government.",

            "description": "China\u2019s central bank has signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Ant Group, the fintech affiliate of Alibaba Group, to help build a technical platform for its sovereign digital currency, state media reported.China has been developing its electronic yuan, or e-CNY, since 2014 with an aim to replace some of the cash in circulation. In lieu of a timetable for its official launch, the digital cash will first be used for retail payments domestically before it is used abroad, Chinese authorities have said.The two sides will jointly promote the development of the e-CNY, based on Ant\u2019s database, Ocean Base, and its mobile development platform, mPaaS, according to the state tabloid Global Times.The planned e-CNYThe bank has also been working with Ant and Tencent over the past three years to co-develop the e-CNY, the report added, citing information recently disclosed by the country\u2019s two largest e-payment providers.The disclosure appears to suggest that both companies were touting close ties with the regulator despite having come under the government\u2019s intensive anti-monopoly crackdown and investigation.Analysts say the bank needs support from local fintech giants and big retailers to build the infrastructure, including distribution channels for the national virtual currency, which is being tested in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen.Its success, though, may end up taking market shares from these tech firms \u2014 a move observers argue would show that China has planned steps to crack down on monopolies and \u201cnationalize\u201d troves of consumer financial data they own.Who\u2019s the boss?\u201cThe Chinese authorities are telling Ant that you should hand over your big data to the central bank. The data won\u2019t remain in private hands since the Communist Party is the boss,\u201d Francis Lun, CEO of Geo Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong, told VOA by phone.The Financial Times has reported that Beijing has asked Ant to turn over its data to a new state-controlled credit scoring company, which would be run by former executives of the central bank while serving other financial institutions, including competing with Ant\u2019s lending arms.Ant insisted on leading the company, arguing that too much government intervention would drag the industry down, according to news reports. But the regulator disagreed, saying Ant\u2019s involvement in the new company would create a conflict of interest.Lun said that there\u2019s little Ant can do to defy the regulator\u2019s demand.Prospects of the e-CNYHe also expected the e-CNY to be in wide use since all banks in China will also have to comply with the regulator.Lun said that the digital yuan, domestically, will allow the government to monitor every transaction of the users \u201clike a big brother.\u201d Its use abroad it will allow China to bypass the international settlement system, dominated by the U.S. dollar, in what he called a de-dollarization attempt.Jerry Lin, director of the Financial Research Institute at the Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance in Taipei, however, has doubts that the private sector will accept the e-CNY since most private businesses consider cash flows sensitive.He said, once a technical platform is completed, the central bank will next work with retailers to expand the e-CNY\u2019s distribution \u2013 a key step that will determine whether the virtual currency is widely accepted.The bank considers its latest efforts to roll out e-CNY a win-win strategy for itself and the nation\u2019s fintech giants, according to Lin.\u201cBy collaborating with the central bank [to launch the e-CNY], these fintech giants will be relieved from pressure in the regulator\u2019s anti-monopoly probe. Their monopoly is hard to break up unless there emerges a competitor as strong as the e-CNY to take up at least one-third of the market shares,\u201d Lin told VOA.Ant and Tencent respectively control 54% and 40% of China\u2019s e-payment market.Trade-offLin said that, in the short to medium term, it will also be in the fintech firms\u2019 interests to trade some of their shares in China\u2019s e-payment market in exchange for the regulator\u2019s lenient treatment of their online microlending, personal financial management and insurance operations, which generate higher profits.In the long run, though, it is highly likely that China will try to \u201cnationalize\u201d most financial services, which are now dominated by private fintech firms, including e-payment, credit ratings or financial management, he added.No distinctionSome have viewed China\u2019s rapid digitalization of its yuan as a threat to accelerate the decline of the U.S. dollar\u2019s dominance as the world\u2019s leading reserve currency, but New York-based Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder and research director of J Capital Research, disagreed.\u201cI think there\u2019s too much focus being placed on the idea that this is a totally distinct currency and they are in competition. I mean, there\u2019s no difference between the DCEP [digital currency electronic payment for e-CNY] and the renminbi,\u201d she said.\u201cDespite many declarations by China about opening the capital accounts, the reason why it\u2019s not in international use, it remains in less 2% of SWIFT payments by value, the reason for that is because China doesn\u2019t want to make it available,\u201d she told VOA by phone, referring to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, the global system for financial messaging and cross-border payments.She added that she believes China\u2019s planned rollout of e-CNY is purely for supervisory reasons, neither for innovation nor its rivalry with the U.S. dollar.China\u2019s general public will not notice any change, she said, because Ant\u2019s Alipay or Tencent\u2019s WeChat Pay will remain what consumers see, while the central bank will likely work as the engine in the background for both fintech platforms.",

Chuang is simply the latest in a long line of contests alluring fans and contestants alike in a booming sector. The rewards for those taking part are obvious: expensive social followings and lucrative contracts from brands looking to sign them up.

            "description": "People are seen in front of the Tencent company headquarters in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China August 7, 2020. REUTERS/David Kirton/File Photo Acquire Licensing RightsApril 29 (Reuters) - China is preparing a substantial fine for Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) as part of its sweeping antitrust clampdown on the country\u2019s internet giants, but it is likely to be less than the record $2.75 billion penalty imposed on Alibaba earlier this month, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.Tencent should expect a penalty of at least 10 billion yuan ($1.54 billion), significant enough for the State Administration of Market Regulation (SAMR) to make an example of it, both people said.Tencent faces penalties for not properly reporting past acquisitions and investments for antitrust reviews, an offence with a fine capped at 500,000 yuan per case, and for anticompetitive practices in some of its businesses, with music streaming in particular focus, said the sources.Neither SAMR nor Tencent immediately responded to Reuters' requests for comment.\"The attitude from the regulator is that unlike Alibaba you are not the biggest target here, but it would be impossible not to penalise Tencent now that the campaign is in action,\" said one of the people.China has in recent months sought to curb the economic and social power of its once loosely regulated internet giants, in a clampdown backed by President Xi Jinping.Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (9988.HK) are China's two biggest tech conglomerates, with market values of $776 billion and $642 billion, respectively.Earlier this month, SAMR imposed its record fine on Alibaba after an investigation found the e-commerce firm had abused its dominant market position for several years.Tencent's vast businesses include video games, content streaming, social media, advertising and cloud services.SAMR's investigation partly focuses on Tencent Music Entertainment Group (TME.N), which was spun off and listed in the United States in late 2018, two of the people and an additional two sources close to the business said. Tencent Music Entertainment did not immediately respond to request for comment.The regulator has informed Tencent that it should expect a fine, give up exclusive music rights, and may even be forced to sell the acquired Kuwo and Kugou music apps, said the people.However, Tencent's core businesses, video games and WeChat, are likely to remain intact, said one of the people.STREAMING STRANGLEHOLDTencent Music, China's answer to Spotify, acquired competitor apps Kugou and Kuwo in 2016, and pursued exclusive streaming rights with record labels including Universal Music Group, Sony Music Group and Warner Music Group Corp.It then sublicensed some of the rights to competitors including NetEase Cloud Music, which complained that the arrangement was unfair and prices too high.SAMR launched a probe into Tencent Music in 2018 but dropped it in 2019 after the company agreed to stop renewing some of the exclusive rights, which normally expire after three years, two sources told Reuters previously.However, it kept exclusive rights to Jay Chou, the most influential pop star in the Chinese-speaking world, using it as a competitive edge against smaller rivals NetEase Cloud Music and Alibaba-backed Xiami Music.SAMR has told Tencent Music that it should expect to give up some of the remaining exclusive rights, two of the people said.It may also be required to sell Kugou and Kuwo to competitors or other investors, one of the options being proposed to senior government officials in Beijing, three sources said.A forced sale of those units would set a precedent and might be hard to execute, two of them cautioned.Final confirmation of Tencent's punishment will need a nod from China's central leadership, the people said.Tencent is lobbying for a more lenient penalty, they added.\"Tencent doesn't mind paying a hefty fine and is willing to pay more if it needs to, as long as its core businesses remain intact,\" said one of the people, referring to its video games and WeChat app units.Last month, Reuters reported that Tencent will need to meet certain conditions in its plan to merge Huya and Douyu, two leading video game streaming platforms, including giving up exclusivity to broadcast Tencent games to competing streaming sites.SAMR said this week it is investigating Tencent-backed Meituan (3690.HK) over claims the food delivery giant forced vendors to use their platform exclusively, the same offence Alibaba was penalised for.($1 = 6.4860 Chinese yuan)Reporting by Pei Li and Julie Zhu; Editing by Tony Munroe and Sam HolmesOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "description": "A sleepless, white-knuckled night awaited bankers at Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup on April 7 after the Hong Kong stock market closed, as they checked in with colleagues half a world away on Zoom Video Communications' conferencing software.Over the next six-and-half hours late into the night, the Hong Kong-based bankers worked frantically with dealers in New York, Tokyo, London and San Francisco to match buy and sell orders in the world's largest-ever block trade at HK$114.17 billion (US$14.7 billion). On offer was 2 per cent of China's most valuable company, Tencent Holdings.The seller, Naspers of South Africa, was cashing in on one of the most successful venture capital investments of all time to finance its forays into other digital businesses. At its sale price, the Cape Town-based company had notched up a return of over 7,000 times on its investment, based on calculations by South China Morning Post.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.Finding buyers for the block, about nine times more than the average daily traded volume over the past 12 months, was no mean feat because a clumsy exit from the heaviest weighted stock on the Hang Seng Index would potentially set off a calamitous crash not just in Tencent's shares, but also for the world's third-largest capital market. Coming hot on the heels of fire sales in technology stocks in the wake of Archegos Capital's implosion and heightened antitrust scrutiny in China, the timing made it one of the most challenging deals to pull off in the history of finance.Tencent's share price from 2018 to 2021To help clinch the deal, Naspers secretly briefed a small group of money managers 24 hours before the divestment. All in, US$60 billion worth of orders were queued up for the Tencent block that night including about 10 for around US$1 billion each, according to people familiar with the matter.Story continuesTencent's shares, which closed at HK$629.50 before Naspers' Prosus unit announced its sale, never fell below HK$600 in the days since, keeping buyers well in the money above their HK$595 purchase price. The successful sale also underscored the depth and abundance of liquidity in Hong Kong's capital pool, enough to rival US and European markets.Prosus chief financial officer Basil Sgourdos expects Tencent's stock.to continue to rise in value\"That's a great and unique position for Hong Kong and one it can build off going forward,\" Naspers' financial director Basil Sgourdos said in an interview with the Post.Naspers' US$32 million bet on Tencent in 2001 for a 46.5 per cent stake was valued at US$164 billion in 2017, a fortune that helped to finance the newspaper publisher's transformation into an internet conglomerate. Naspers sold 2 per cent of Tencent in March 2018 at HK$405 per share, ahead of a 45 per cent price plunge to HK$259 over the next seven months that took another eight months to claw back.Fast forward to 2021, and Shenzhen-based Tencent faces a crackdown by Chinese regulators determined to break up the country's internet monopolies. Some investors worry that this latest sale by Tencent's largest shareholder presages another sell-off. Most stock analysts say that is unlikely, and 93 per cent of the 67 analysts who cover Tencent recommend investors \"buy\" the stock.\"History never simply repeats itself,\" said Tencent analysts at Chinese bank CICC.Prosus, Naspers' global internet investment arm and the holder of the Tencent stake since 2019, is adamant that the future of the Chinese internet behemoth remains bright and has committed to holding onto its remaining Tencent stake for at least three years.\"We think there is more value to come,\" said Sgourdos, who is also Prosus' chief financial officer.That being said, Prosus was eager to take advantage of buoyant markets to fill its war chest for acquisitions, announcing two weeks after its divestment an US$80 million acquisition of the European online-trading group BUX.\"Even in times of volatility, investors want exposure to China tech,\" said Alex Abagian, co-head of equity capital markets in the region at Morgan Stanley, which tops investment banking league tables for large equity sales in Asia.Ahead of the expiry of Prosus' lock-up following the 2018 sale, some investors signalled they wanted to buy. Sgourdos, who oversaw the 2018 sale, considered his options.\"We wanted to do a quick transaction and move on with life,\" he said, which meant a block sale rather than dribbling shares through the market or entering bilateral talks with other investors.Prosus rehired Citigroup and Morgan Stanley, who had worked on its 2018 sale. Goldman Sachs replaced Bank of America in the line up given its ranking in the league tables and after BofA's James Fleming defected to Citi.Together, they decided to take a small group of investors into their confidence, a process known as wall-crossing. For flash sales, wall-crossing gives portfolio managers time to win approval for big-ticket purchases from headquarters, sometimes located in a different time zone, and provides the seller feedback from investors on what they would be willing to pay.Prosus also sought to minimise the potential shock to the market, as happened in 2018. Prosus and its bankers were confident that Hong Kong had enough liquidity to absorb such a large transaction.Mainland China's investors had been able to trade Hong Kong-listed stocks since 2014 via the Stock Connect cross-border channel linking the city's bourse with Shanghai and Shenzhen. The resulting influx of mainland Chinese money into Hong Kong has nearly doubled the value of trading to HK$32 trillion last year. Still, 2 per cent of Tencent in one fell swoop was roughly equal to seven days of trading on average, the same ratio as in 2018.\"Hong Kong has developed by leaps and bounds in terms of the exchange's ability to draw in all pockets of global capital,\" said Phyllis Wang, a managing director in Goldman Sachs' ECM syndicate team. Goldman ranks second in Asia Pacific equity sales so far this year.As Sgourdos pondered when to press the launch button, one challenge was picking the best date. The company's lock-up from its 2018 sale expired on March 22, and Tencent reported its earnings on March 24, ahead of three non-trading days in Hong Kong over the Easter holidays. Another consideration was Hong Kong's higher stamp duty kicks in on August 1. Prosus picked the aftermarket hours of April 7.Tencent shares fell 3.8 per cent on April 7. Prosus decided not to nickel-and-dime investors, since the stock had risen more than 162 fold from Tencent's initial public offering in 2004 and pushed ahead.Some of the bankers were nervous. They pitched the sale below the technically important HK$600 level to grab investors' attention from the get-go.Tencent's founder and chief executive Pony Ma Huateng at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai on September 17, 2018. Photo: ReutersThe sale launched at 4.55pm, after the market had closed in Hong Kong. Terms sheets flashed on investors' screens offering stock between HK$575 and HK$595 a share. Sales traders hit the phones, encouraging their best clients to buy.One of the bankers involved in the deal described the process as \"ruthless\" and \"meticulous\" as the team hunted for investors from Tokyo, through London to the east and west coast of the US.The wall-crossing had generated orders for roughly three-quarters of the block at the lower end of that price range, creating the impression of a supply shortage. The tactic worked, and within 20 minutes the bankers had amassed enough demand for all of the stock.From then on, the banks worked to boost the sale price. Unusually, the teams were confident enough to narrow the price range to between HK$585 and HK$595 midway through the sale. Most of the investors who had pitched low hurriedly raised their offer prices with only roughly a few billion dollars worth of orders falling away.Over 450 buyers held up their hands for Tencent shares that night, more than the 300 in 2018, with China-domiciled investors making up most of the difference. Between 60 and 65 per cent of the book came from Asia-based investors, or the Asian offices of global firms, and roughly a third from the US.\"Hong Kong markets have changed dramatically over the past few years, not just from significant southbound flows but also Chinese investors' participation in Hong Kong transactions,\" said Harish Raman, head of Citigroup's Asia Pacific equity capital markets syndicate team. Citi ranks second in Asia Pacific ex-Japan IPOs so far this year.The sale closed at HK$595 a share before midnight at the top end of the range, and a 5.5 per cent discount to the April 7 closing price in the market, narrower than the 7.8 per cent discount in 2018. After the sale, Prosus still holds 28.9 per cent of Tencent as the Chinese company's largest single shareholder. Tencent's founder and chief executive Pony Ma Huateng is the second-biggest shareholder with a 7.4 per cent stake.When bankers divvied up shares between investors across the next three hours, they placed half in the hands of 10 institutions and 70 per cent with the top 20, hoping that concentrating shares in the hands of buy-and-hold investors would buoy the aftermarket. About a third of the buyers were long-term investors, a greater proportion than in 2018, including sovereign wealth funds and existing Tencent and Naspers' shareholders. Hedge funds and index trackers also took part in the deal.Tencent shares fell 1.5 per cent on April 8, as the market digested Prosus' divestment but stayed above the sale price before rising 0.08 per cent a day later. Bankers were jubilant.The sale was a stand-out even in a banner year for deal-making. Globally, block trades have swollen 181 per cent so far this year to a record US$59 billion, according to Refinitiv.Prosus paid roughly US$100 million in costs, including bankers' fees, foreign exchange and US$14.7 million in stamp duty. The banks' fees of about 30 basis points of the deal's value, roughly US$44 million, reflect their \"best efforts\" rather than any guarantee that they would sell all the shares, known as hard underwriting, according to two people familiar with the matter.The sale secured Morgan Stanley and Goldman's positions as leaders in arranging block trades across the region, while Citi's participation pushed Credit Suisse out of third place, Refinitiv data showed. The three banks' market share swelled by between 2.6 and 15.7 percentage points, bolstering their bragging rights and making it more likely they will win mandates in future.Prosus, already one of the largest technology investors in the world, took home US$14.6 billion in net proceeds from the sale to plough into food delivery, classifieds, digital payments and online education that have all boomed during the coronavirus pandemic. The company, which does not have to pay capital gains tax on the divestment under Dutch law, is likely to spend half of the proceeds on acquisitions and the rest on share buy-backs, said ABN Amro analysts.\"We needed meaningful capital and we needed to pursue other opportunities,\" said Sgourdos. \"It's not easy to raise US$15 billion in one go, and there was an opportunity here. We've got a very full pipeline around our core priorities, and we're actually engaged on a number of that could very easily, in the next year or so, consume all of that cash.\"The joke among traders and investors is that a deal that would normally only happen once in a career has now become a recurring event as Hong Kong's market continues to deepen. Investors will watch for the next sale from April 2024, when Prosus' lock-up on its remaining US$224 billion stake expires.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

I am finally clocking out,\u201d he told his 1.5 million Weibo followers on Saturday.\u201cProduce Camp 2021,\u201d also known as \u201cChuang,\u201d reflects the massive growth in popularity of Chinese boy-band groups, a kind of answer to K-pop. The TV show, which is produced by the entertainment arm of Tencent, is one of several like it in recent years and has reportedly been viewed more than any other program in China so far this year.While previous seasons included mostly Chinese performers, \u201cChuang 2021\u201d brought together 90 male trainees from countries around the world \u2014 including China, Thailand, Ukraine and the United States \u2014 to form an 11-member boy group as voted by its massive global audience.Ivanov, a fashion marketer and part-time model, said he had only come to the set, on a man-made island off China\u2019s tropical province of Hainan, to serve as an interpreter for two Japanese friends who were competing. But when he was confused for a contestant, the show\u2019s director persuaded him to join.Advertisement\u201cThe director saw that I am fluent in Mandarin and they thought I\u2019m good-looking, so they asked if I\u2019d like to have a try and experience a new lifestyle,\u201d he said in one backstage interview. \u201cDancing and singing every day, I\u2019m really exhausted and now starting to regret my decision.\u201dIvanov expected he would be cut by the first elimination.

Their phones were confiscated until they were eliminated, and anyone who wanted to leave early would face steep fees to break the terms of the contract.Despite his intentionally lackluster performances of a Russian rap song, Ivanov \u2014 much to his dismay \u2014 only skyrocketed in popularity. One plea earlier this month for fans to stop voting for him drew 55 million views, making it the second-most watched interview clip to come out of the show.\u201cI\u2019m standing here feeling scared, but I still believe that my fans will respect my choice of not to be in a boy group. I believe they know how far they should go,\u201d he said earlier this month, before a final set of rankings were announced before the finale.AdvertisementSome skeptical viewers had theorized that Ivanov was putting on a nonchalant attitude to stand out from a crowded field of contestants all vying for the same spot. But his makeup artist on the show told one Chinese vlogger that the stint on the show had in fact cast him into a depressive state.On April 18, Ivanov\u2019s fan club announced they would \u201crespect Lelush\u2019s choice\u201d and halt their campaign to keep voting for him. He did not receive enough votes to make it into the final group chosen for the band INTO1, as revealed during the finale on Saturday.The following day, once the contestants got their phones back, Ivanov posted a meme of himself clad in a bright yellow hoodie. Sporting a rare smile, he wrote that he felt \u201chappy as a clam.\u201d",

REUTERS/Tingshu Wang Acquire Licensing RightsSummaryCompanies Raising around $7 billion in share saleSelling around $3 billion in convertible bondsTo fund R&D for autonomous vehicle, drone deliveriesHONG KONG, April 19 (Reuters) - Food delivery behemoth Meituan (3690.HK) has raised $10 billion in a stock and convertible bonds sale, underscoring strong investor faith in the growth prospects of some Chinese tech firms despite a regulatory clampdown on the sector.The Tencent-backed firm with a market valuation of $220 billion said it plans to use its new warchest to invest in autonomous delivery vehicles, delivery drones and other cutting-edge technology.\"Meituan will use most of the capital in updating its delivery system which currently relies on human drivers and will soon be unaffordable for the company as labour costs continue to rise in China, said Zhang Yi, head of consultancy iiMedia Research.\"It is making plans for its future in 5 to 10 years time,\" he added.Analysts also expect the company to shore up its community group bulk buying service, Meituan Select, which has been growing in popularity. The service is part of its new initiatives division which has been reporting operating losses and is expected to continue to do so for the next few quarters.In a record fundraising for the company, Meituan sold $6.6 billion in shares and gained roughly $3 billion in two-tranche convertible bonds. Another $400 million was raised by selling more shares to Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK), its largest shareholder whose stake now stands at around 17%.At least 300 investors placed orders to buy the stock with the top 20 orders taking up about two-thirds of the offer, said a source with knowledge of the matter.Most demand came from global long-only funds, hedge funds and Chinese investors, said the source, who declined to be named as the deal details were not public.Meituan declined to comment.The robust demand comes as Chinese regulators crack down on technology giants for a range of violations from monopolistic behaviour to flouting rules for handling customer data.These include a record $2.8 billion fine this month on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (9988.HK), for antimonopoly violations, while Meituan Select was among five platforms fined by China last month for improper pricing behaviour.\"Chinese regulators ... just intend to regulate them as per the law,\" said Zhang. \"Financing access, for both giants and startups, hasn't changed and will keep being available.\"Tencent last week raised $4.2 billion in a bond offering that was the company\u2019s second in a year.Meituan, which competes with Alibaba-backed Ele.me among others, had an estimated 68.2% of the Chinese food delivery market in the second quarter of 2020, according to Trustdata.Food delivery in China, which brings in more than half of Meituan's total sales, has grown by more than five times since 2016 to be worth over 650 billion yuan ($100 billion), according to iResearch. Meituan's services also include restaurant review sites and bike-sharing.The company sold 187 million shares at HK$273.80 each, near the top end of the indicative range set on Monday. At $7 billion in equity sales, the deal is the sixth largest follow-on share sale by a Hong Kong-listed company, according to Dealogic data.The convertible bond offers a zero coupon rate, meaning investors buy to secure future equity gains when it converts into stock. They would have their principal repaid at maturity if the option to convert into shares is not exercised.($1 = 6.4950 yuan)Reporting by Scott Murdoch and Yingzhi Yang, editing by Louise HeavensOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "description": "(Nikkei Asia) \u2014 Chinese internet conglomerate Tencent Holdings is raising the stakes in the race against global companies for the burgeoning cloud services market in Asia, with a plan to open two data centers in Indonesia by the end of this year.The Shenzhen-based company said it would build most of its planned data centers in Asia, including South Korea and Thailand, as well as the Middle East, Poshu Yeung, Tencent Cloud International\u2019s senior vice president told Nikkei Asia in an interview.Tencent operates 20 data centers outside China, with the first batch launched in Europe and the U.S. But amid growing political tensions between China and Western countries, Yeung said the company plans to add 30% to 50% more data centers by the end of this year mostly in the Asian region.During the coronavirus pandemic, Asia has experienced fast growth in video conferencing, e-commerce, online education, gaming and livestreaming as people spend more time at home.In order to cater to the surging demand for online services, big technology companies such as Alphabet\u2019s Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, as well as China e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding, are racing to build data centers to monetize opportunities in the digital transformation of Asia. Investment in data centers in Asia-Pacific quadrupled to $2.2 billion last year from 2019, according to property consultant CBRE.Among Asian countries, Indonesia is one of the hottest battlegrounds for cloud services. Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook have announced plans to build their first data centers in the country, the world\u2019s fourth largest with a population of 270 million. Alibaba also has opened two data centers in Indonesia, and plans to add a third.\u201cI think Indonesia is actually one of the fastest-growing cloud-business markets in Southeast Asia,\u201d Yeung said. \u201cThis is the first time we are launching two data centers in the same year in the same market. It shows how committed we are and how much we value the local market.\u201dThe new data center, located in Jakarta\u2019s central business district, will support a wide range of industries, including financial services, e-commerce, entertainment, gaming and education. Local cloud infrastructure bases help reduce delays in data processing, enabling companies to launch more competitive services compared with those using overseas cloud facilities.\u201cBy establishing our data centers, our presence will help us get more local businesses,\u201d Yeung said.Tencent was the fourth largest player in the Asia-Pacific cloud market after Alibaba, Amazon and Microsoft, according to a 2019 report by research company Gartner.Tencent\u2019s local clients include Jakarta-based Bank Neo Commerce, which will use Tencent\u2019s database to support its digital banking services. While Yeung believes financial technology has big growth potential in Southeast Asia, he said that Tencent does not have plans to run its own virtual-banking services. He said the company also is talking with local governments to provide data support for public services.Tencent has provided technological support for livestreaming events of Singapore e-commerce platform Shopee. The daily viewing time of Shopee\u2019s live site increased more than 15-fold over the past year.By building its own data centers, Tencent also is looking to accelerate the overseas expansion of the other services under the group, including music app Joox and video-streaming platform WeTV in emerging Asian markets.\u201cThe fact that we have a lot of our own businesses and also investee companies around the world targeting or doing businesses in Indonesia, it makes a lot of sense for us to have our own data centers,\u201d Yeung said.This article was originally published by Nikkei AsiaContact editor Yang Ge (geyang@caixin.com)Download our app to receive breaking news alerts and read the news on the go.Follow the Chinese markets in real time with Caixin Global\u2019s new stock database.",

            "description": "(THE BUSINESS TIMES) - The cloud services division of Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings has launched its first Internet data centre in Indonesia as it looks to anchor itself in the region's booming digital economy.With the data centre, Tencent Cloud's infrastructure network now spans across 27 regions and 61 availability zones.Located in the central business district of Jakarta, the latest data centre is in full operation and is aimed at supporting the growing needs of a wide range of industries.Poshu Yeung, senior vice-president of Tencent Cloud International, said many local companies have realised the importance of going digital after being impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.\"The need for South-east Asia's and Indonesia's growth online is pretty clear. So it's great timing for us to start building up our presence in Indonesia,\" he told The Business Times.Companies in Indonesia using Tencent's cloud services include Bank Neo Commerce, enterprise communications company Aestron and entertainment streaming platform JOOX.Tencent Cloud started expanding outside of China about three years ago as its rivals, most prominently Alibaba Cloud, aggressively sought out the growing global demand for cloud services amid increasing digitalisation.The company has around 20 availability zones across 13 regions outside of China. It expects to grow its number of international data centres by 30 to 50 per cent in 2021, Mr Yeung said.Over the last five months, Tencent Cloud announced the launch of a second data centre in South Korea, and a data centre hub for the Middle East and North Africa in Bahrain, which will go live by end-2021. It plans to launch second data centres in Indonesia, Thailand, Japan and Frankfurt this year. In Indonesia, it will be the company's first time launching two data centres in the same market in the same year.Tencent Cloud has two data centres in Singapore and Mr Yeung said the company intends to have at least one more in the future, although land scarcity and regulations remain a challenge.The international business saw a triple-digit percentage growth last year, with South-east Asia being one of the fastest-growing markets, according to Mr Yeung.Customers generally go for out-of-box solutions but \"in South-east Asia we see a lot of interesting ideas from clients, and that's why it's exciting for us because...we can help businesses finetune solutions to meet their requirements\", he said.Sectors in the region poised for strong growth include fintech, e-commerce, healthcare, education and gaming.Tencent hired more than 3,000 employees for its cloud division last year as competition in the cloud computing space intensified, a Reuters report said. The company also pledged 500 billion yuan (S$102.7 billion) over five years for investments in technology infrastructure, including cloud computing.",

REUTERS/Tingshu Wang Acquire Licensing RightsBEIJING, April 13 (Reuters) - China\u2019s market regulator, fresh from fining e-commerce giant Alibaba $2.75 billion, said on Tuesday it warned nearly three dozen internet companies to stop using any banned practices such as forcing vendors to use their platform exclusively.The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said it summoned 34 companies including Tencent (0700.HK), ByteDance and JD.com for a meeting, where it ordered them to conduct self-inspections within one month, warning of \"severe punishment\" for any that still violated the rules.In February, China issued new anti-monopoly guidelines targeting internet platforms.On Saturday, SAMR hit Alibaba with a record 18.2 billion yuan fine, and on Tuesday told the other Internet firms to heed that lesson. The regulator is beefing up staff and other resources in order to strengthen antitrust enforcement, Reuters has reported.In the statement issued on its website, SAMR described the overall development of China's platform economy as improving, but said no time should be wasted in correcting the way companies operate to ensure they comply with the law.China's cyberspace regulator and tax administration were also represented at the meeting, SAMR said.In addition to Tencent, JD.com and ByteDance, search giant Baidu and food delivery platform Meituan (3690.HK) were among the firms called in by SAMR. None provided immediate comment.\"The regulators are not aimed at a single enterprise, but the whole platform economy, as it is growing more and more powerful,\" said Keso Hong, an independent analyst in Beijing.\"I believe the companies will be more prudent in the future. Meanwhile, I think it is good for the regulator to give them a reminder to prevent them from ending up like Alibaba.\"SAMR also criticised abusive practices in community group buying, when companies offer aggressively low prices to woo users, and warned against abuse of big data and tax-related violations.In particular, the regulator warned against the practice of forcing vendors to operate on only one platform, a tactic known as \"choose one from two\".\"It is extremely harmful and must be corrected from the root,\" the SAMR statement said.Reporting by Tony Munroe and Sophie Yu; Editing by Kim CoghillOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "description": "SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese online insurance technology firm Waterdrop Inc is receiving pushback from domestic regulators on its planned U.S. initial public offering as its business model is seen as risky, four people familiar with the situation told Reuters.Waterdrop, which is backed by internet giant Tencent Holdings, has been working with financial advisers since mid last year on going public and had already made a confidential filing for the float, said three of the people.The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), however, has questioned the company's business risks, which has slowed down the IPO process, they said. CBIRC even told founder Shen Peng this month that it would not suggest that Waterdrop go public at this point, said one of the sources.Beijing-headquartered Waterdrop distributes insurance policies online and provides illness crowd-funding. It was not immediately clear what exactly CBIRC felt was risky in its business.Waterdrop denied in an emailed statement that Chinese regulators were opposed to its capital markets plan, adding that its senior managers are in regular communication with regulators.CBIRC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The sources declined to comment as the information is private.The scrutiny on Waterdrop and its IPO comes as China's financial regulators have stepped up supervision over the country's financial technology companies after the halting of Ant Group's $37 billion IPO in November due to financial risks.Waterdrop does not need Chinese regulatory approval to list in the United States as, like many other mainland startups, it's incorporated offshore, but CBIRC's reservations about the IPO do not bode well for such companies' share sale plans in general.Waterdrop had aimed to go public by end-2020 but is now looking to list in the second quarter, according to two of the sources. It was not immediately known how much Waterdrop is seeking to raise or at what valuation.The company last month shut down its online healthcare mutual aid platform, which provided users with a shared basic health plan covering various types of critical illnesses, amid regulatory headwinds.Waterdrop said the programme had served 80 million users. Such platforms are, however, not licensed by the CBIRC.The mutual aid platform was considered one of the main generators of user traffic and clipping it would mean a major business model change for the company, said two sources familiar with the company.Founded in 2016 by Shen, a former executive at Chinese food delivery and local services giant Meituan, Waterdrop raised $230 million in a pre-IPO round in August led by reinsurer Swiss Re and Tencent at a valuation of about $2 billion.It also counts IDG Capital, Boyu Capital and Meituan as investors.Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, which are advising Waterdrop on its IPO, declined to comment.Reporting by Samuel Shen in Shanghai, Kane Wu and Scott Murdoch in Hong Kong, and Cheng Leng in Beijing; Additional reporting by Yingzhi Yang in Beijing; Editing by Sumeet Chatterjee and Muralikumar AnantharamanOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

REUTERS/Tingshu Wang Acquire Licensing Rights(Reuters) -Holland-based technology investor Prosus NV has sold 2% of Tencent Holdings Ltd <0700.HK> for $14.7 billion, the Chinese gaming and social media giant said on Thursday, in the world's largest-ever block trade.Tencent, in a Hong Kong Stock Exchange filing, said Prosus sold 191.89 million shares for HK$114.1 billion ($14.67 billion), reducing its stake to 28.9%.That works out as HK$595 per share, confirming Reuters' earlier report in which sources said Prosus sold the stock at the top of an indicative range of HK$575 to $HK595.The price was a 5.5% discount to Tencent's Wednesday close of $HK629.50. The stock, which is up 10% so far this year, opened down 2.5% in Hong Kong following the news on Thursday.Prosus, majority controlled by Naspers Ltd, did not respond to a request for comment on the pricing.The block trade - or the usually private, single trade of a large amount of securities - surpassed the previous record set in 2018 when Naspers also sold 2% of Tencent for $9.8 billion, Refinitiv data showed.\"The proceeds of the sale will increase our financial flexibility, enabling us to invest in the significant growth potential we see across the group, as well as in our own stock,\" Prosus Chief Executive Bob van Dijk said in a statement.Prosus also invests in online food delivery platforms, classified marketplaces and digital payments businesses.For the half-year ended Sept. 30, it reported a 29% increase in core earnings at $2.2 billion, as proceeds from its Tencent stake offset losses at other online interests.\"We expect the news to viewed cautiously until there is more clarity on how the funds will be redeployed,\" analysts at Renaissance Capital said in a client note.The sale is unlikely to lead to any short-term reduction in the gap between the market value of Prosus at 160 billion euros ($189.92 billion) and that of its Tencent stake at 200 billion euros as of Wednesday, the analysts said.Citigroup Inc , Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc were joint global coordinators for the sale.($1 = 0.8425 euros)($1 = 7.7849 Hong Kong dollars)Reporting by Scott Murdoch in Hong Kong, Toby Sterling in Amsterdam and Abhinav Ramnarayan in London; Editing by Jane Merriman and Christopher CushingOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "description": "The studio behind the popular mobile title, Call of Duty: Mobile, has earned a staggering $10 billion in 2020, Reuters said in a report. TiMi Studios is owned by Tencent and develops two immensely popular games, one being Call of Duty: Mobile while the other one is the multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) Honor of Kings. And this monetary success has made TiMi the world\u2019s largest developer, Reuters said citing its sources.advertisementIt is not, however, clear on what parameters TiMi would become the largest developer in the world. But the $10 billion figure in revenue is a big deal. Just to put things in perspective, Activision, the company that owns the IP rights of Call of Duty posted revenue of $8.09 billion last year, which is significantly lower than what TiMi has made. Call of Duty: Mobile is published by TiMi, much like how PUBG Mobile is by Tencent Games. Krafton is the original owner of PUBG IP.Now people, including the players of Call of Duty: Mobile and Honor of Kings, are not familiar with the name TiMi but it is behind some of the biggest mobile games in the world. While Call of Duty: Mobile grew by numbers to reach 100 million downloads in the first week of its launch back in October 2019, Honor of Kings -- which is only available in China -- enjoys a base of 100 million daily active users as of November last year, according to the data released by Tencent, the Chinese colossus that owns TiMi.TiMi is now shifting its focus to move beyond mobile games in its attempt to take on industry heavyweights that are behind some of the biggest \u201cAAA\u201d titles. These games are universally available, meaning you can play them on a Sony PlayStation console, an Xbox, or Nintendo\u2019s Switch handheld console. It is recruiting people in China for a new AAA game that will borrow heavily from the movie Ready Player One. This AAA title, TiMi thinks, will \u201ccompete head-to-head against big powers from Japan, Korea, Europe and U.S.\u201dNot just the AAA title, but TiMi is also getting an overseas studio, which will be one of the two that Tencent is developing right now. The other one will be for Lightspeed and Quantum. Both the studios will be in Los Angeles and will be focused on creating content with \u201coriginal intellectual property that has global appeal\u201d, according to the Reuters report.Tencent Games, which owns TiMi, reported total revenue of $23.79 billion in online games, out of which TiMi\u2019s proceeds accounted for 40 per cent, two sources told Reuters. The Chinese giant is behind some of the biggest mobile titles in the world, including PUBG Mobile that was banned in India last year exactly because of the association with the Chinese company. After the ban was in place, Krafton, the original owner of the PUBG IP, severed ties with Tencent Games as far as publishing rights were concerned for the Indian market. Krafton is now deadlocked with the government over the release of PUBG Mobile India.",

            "description": "Chinese tech giants are expanding in Singapore as they face a crackdown at home and growing pressure in other key markets \u2014 but they may struggle to find talent in the city-state.Messaging-and-gaming behemoth Tencent is opening a hub and TikTok owner ByteDance is on a hiring spree after establishing a regional headquarters, while e-commerce giant Alibaba is investing in property and recruiting.The tech firms are shifting their focus to booming Southeast Asian markets as authorities tighten the screws at home amid concerns about the platforms\u2019 growing power.China\u2019s regulators have launched a blitz on the sector, hitting several firms with heavy fines, and threatening to slice up massive companies whose reach now extends deep into the daily lives of ordinary Chinese.Meanwhile, festering tensions between Washington and Beijing after an assault on Chinese tech titans during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency make the United States an unattractive prospect, and problems abound elsewhere.\u201cChinese tech companies are facing regulatory pressures and sanctions from governments in other countries, notably the U.S. but also other nations such as India,\u201d Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific chief economist at IHS Markit, told AFP.India has banned a swathe of Chinese apps since a border clash last year, while the European Union and other Western powers recently imposed sanctions over China\u2019s treatment of the Muslim Uyghur minority, prompting retaliatory sanctions.But Singapore, a prosperous financial hub, maintains good ties with Beijing and the West, and tech firms have come to view it as a safe bet to expand their operations without upsetting either side.In the current climate of geopolitical uncertainty \u201cSingapore is considered as a more neutral country,\u201d Chen Guoli, professor of strategy at the Singapore campus of business school INSEAD, told AFP.Hiring spreeIn addition, long-running turmoil in traditional rival Hong Kong may have dimmed the territory\u2019s appeal, although observers stress other factors are likely more important.The influx of Chinese cash will be welcome in Singapore, whose economy has been hammered by the coronavirus and which is seeking to build itself up as a tech center.It is already home to major offices of U.S. tech titans Facebook, Google and Twitter, while ByteDance recently moved into bigger offices in the financial district and has launched a hiring drive.Between September and February, a third of ByteDance\u2019s job postings were in Singapore, more than twice the ads it placed in China, with a focus on hiring specialized engineers, said Ajay Thalluri, an analyst with data and analytics firm GlobalData.Meanwhile, Alibaba last year bought a 50 percent stake in an office tower, where its e-commerce unit Lazada is the main tenant, while its affiliate, fintech giant Ant Group, won a license to operate a wholesale digital bank in the city-state.Alibaba \u201cis building teams in Singapore with significant key senior and mid-level job postings related to talent acquisition, product management, and legal compliance,\u201d said Thalluri.The e-commerce firm, co-founded by Jack Ma, has come under fierce pressure in China, with authorities pulling the plug on Ant\u2019s record initial public offering in November.Talent crunchByteDance and Tencent, which announced its Singapore expansion plans in September, say they are primarily focused on growing their businesses in Southeast Asia, a booming region of 650 million, rather than avoiding tensions elsewhere.By building up their Singapore presence, the tech giants are hedging their bets in case frictions with the West hit a new nadir, analysts say.Chen of INSEAD said Chinese companies needed a \u201cplan B\u201d in case they had to separate their global and Chinese operations, in which case Singapore could become their international hub.However, a major challenge in expanding in the city, with a population of just 5.7 million, is recruiting workers with the correct skills.\u201cTechnology is developing and accelerating at a speed that far surpasses the supply of talent needed to scale,\u201d said Daljit Sall, senior director for information technology at the Singapore office of global recruitment firm Randstad.Singapore is trying to attract overseas talent, although that may cause unease in a country where there are already concerns about the large foreign population, while schools are offering courses to prepare youngsters for tech jobs.Nevertheless, \u201cthere still remains an urgent need to fill these skills gaps now,\u201d Sall said.",

REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights(Reuters) - Chinese tech giant Tencent's Timi Studios, maker of popular video games Honor of Kings and Call of Duty Mobile, generated revenue of $10 billion last year, two people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.The $10 billion would make Timi the world's largest developer, the sources say, which many industry watchers had suspected to be the case.It also provides a hefty basis for its ambitions to move beyond mobile games and compete directly with global heavyweights developing expensive \"AAA\" titles on platforms such as desktop computers, Sony's PlayStation, Nintendo's Switch and Microsoft's Xbox.In a recruitment notice last month, a Timi engineer wrote that the company aims to create a new AAA game that resembles the virtual community from the movie Ready Player One, and will \"compete head-to-head against big powers from Japan, Korea, Europe and U.S.\"Tencent is building studios overseas, including one for Timi and one for Lightspeed and Quantum, both in Los Angeles, with the goal of creating content with original intellectual property that has global appeal.Tencent aims eventually to derive half its game revenue from overseas, from 23 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019, the most recently available figure.Many major studios are turning to Tencent for support to convert their \"hardcore\" desktop or console games to mobile. Such games feature long sessions and in-depth storytelling or battles, with some including multiplayer online role-playing or online battle arenas.Last week, Tencent reported 156.1 billion yuan ($23.79 billion) in overall online game revenues for 2020 but did not break down revenue for individual studios, which are run independently and compete with each other.Timi's proceeds accounted for 40% of the game revenue, said the two people.Of Tencent's remaining gaming revenue last year, its Lightspeed and Quantum studio, the developer of PUBG Mobile, another top-grossing game, contributed 29%, the people said, while 26% was proceeds from publishing for other developers. Aurora Studios Group, boosted by its Moonlight Blade Mobile title, contributed 3%, the people said.The sources declined to be identified because the information is not public.Tencent did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment.Tencent, which has benefited from a surge in paying gamers, said last week its online games revenue rose 29% to 39.1 billion yuan in the fourth quarter.($1 = 6.5619 Chinese yuan renminbi)Reporting by Pei Li and Tony Munroe.

            "description": "LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Naspers\u2019 Tencent problem is as big as ever. The $100 billion South African company has long traded at a hefty discount to the value of its 31% stake in the Chinese internet giant, which is currently worth around $239 billion. The three basic causes remain the same: Naspers\u2019 inability to easily sell the shares, its reluctance to do so, and its outsized weighting on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The last one looks the easiest to fix.It\u2019s two decades since Koos Bekker, then chief executive of a mostly domestic media group, spent $36 million buying a third of the Chinese tech startup. It proved to be one of the most lucrative investments in history, on a par with SoftBank boss Masayoshi Son\u2019s purchase of a similar chunk of Chinese e-commerce group Alibaba, two years earlier. Since it bought the stake Naspers has delivered a total return to shareholders, including dividends, of nearly 12,000% in U.S. dollar terms.Even then, however, Naspers has lagged Tencent\u2019s runaway value. In 2019 the South African group attempted to close that discount by moving its Tencent stake, along with investments in startups like Russia\u2019s Mail.ru and German takeaway group Delivery Hero, into an Amsterdam-listed subsidiary called Prosus. The idea was that investors who wanted exposure to Naspers\u2019 assets but were unwilling or unable to invest in a South African group could buy stock in the Dutch company instead.Though the move initially helped, the gap has widened again recently. Prosus holds assets worth a combined $273 billion, using current share prices and Bank of America\u2019s analysis of its unlisted investments. That\u2019s well in excess of the company\u2019s $181 billion market value. Meanwhile, Naspers\u2019 market capitalisation is $31 billion less than the implied value of its 73% shareholding in Prosus. Put it all together and Naspers trades at a 49% discount to the underlying value of its share of the Dutch company\u2019s assets.The simplest way to address this would be for Prosus to sell its Tencent shares and distribute the cash to its investors, including Naspers. Yet this underestimates the difficulties of offloading a shareholding worth almost as much as South Africa\u2019s gross domestic product. When Naspers trimmed its stake from 33% to 31% in 2018, Tencent\u2019s share price nearly halved in the following six months. Cashing in such a profitable investment would also land Naspers with a South African tax bill for as much as $50 billion. Other potential ideas, such as distributing Hong Kong-listed Tencent stock to Naspers and Prosus shareholders, would also trigger big tax liabilities.Another obstacle to a sale is Bob van Dijk, who replaced Bekker as Naspers chief executive. The Dutchman remains wedded to the Tencent stake. Besides its financial clout, the shareholding gives Naspers insight into the development of new tech businesses in the People\u2019s Republic, which inform its investments elsewhere in the world. Though the company is in theory free to sell more Tencent shares after a three-year lockup expires on Sunday, it\u2019s unlikely to do so.And even if other shareholders disagree, there\u2019s not much they can do about it. Naspers\u2019 independence is guaranteed via two separate unlisted South African companies which hold a majority of super-voting stock. Prosus has a similar structure which kicks in if its parent\u2019s stake in the Dutch subsidiary ever falls below 50%. These defences are another reason for external investors to mark down Naspers and Prosus shares.That leaves the final problem: Naspers\u2019 size relative to Johannesburg\u2019s stock market. The company has long been the biggest constituent of the local exchange, with a weighting so substantial that local funds are periodically forced to sell shares to reduce their exposure to a single company. The Prosus spinoff addressed that problem by transferring a chunk of value to Amsterdam. But Tencent\u2019s strong performance since \u2013 the Chinese company\u2019s share price has almost doubled in the past two years - has dragged up the value of its largest shareholder. As of the end of February, Naspers accounted for almost a fifth of the local bourse, according to FTSE Russell data. That is once again weighing on its price.Last October Prosus attempted to address the problem by announcing it would spend $5 billion buying back its own shares and those of its parent. A more dramatic option would be to swap more of Naspers for Prosus, offering South African investors shares in the Amsterdam-listed company at a discount of, say, 10%. If Naspers lowered its stake in Prosus from 73% to 65% in this way, $13 billion of value would shift from Johannesburg to Amsterdam. That would provide Naspers with some headroom on its local bourse and give investors an incentive to close the valuation gap between the two companies, especially if there was a chance of van Dijk repeating the exercise in the future. Provided Naspers hangs on to more than 50% of Prosus, its overall control and tax status should remain unchanged.Such a reshuffle would not address the two biggest factors discouraging Naspers investors from attaching a higher value to the company: its inability to realise the full value of the Tencent stake, and its reluctance to do so. But tackling the South African overhang could help solve one-third of the problem.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Opinions expressed are those of the author.

            "description": "ByteDance has been boosting its gaming arm Nuverse through a hiring spree and in March acquired gaming studio Moonton. Getty ImagesGUANGZHOU, China \u2014 ByteDance has acquired major mobile gaming studio Moonton, highlighting its ambitions in the video game industry and pitting it against Chinese giant Tencent . Known as the owner of TikTok or Douyin in China, ByteDance is looking to diversify beyond advertising and take a slice of the $86 billion mobile gaming market as well as expand its footprint internationally. ByteDance's gaming arm Nuverse, founded in 2019, was behind the acquisition. \"Moonton is the perfect partner to help expand our gaming strategy in international markets,\" ByteDance said in a statement. Reuters reported that the deal valued Moonton at $4 billion, citing two unnamed sources. ByteDance declined to comment on the value of the deal.\"This is a mega deal in the global gaming industry, not only within China. So the M&A craze in the gaming sector continues, and I believe ByteDance is still on the lookout for other studios,\" Serkan Toto, CEO of consultancy Kantan Games, told CNBC. \"Be prepared for a long war between Tencent and ByteDance for acquiring game content.\"ByteDance's international pushTencent is a world leader in mobile gaming and behind some of the top titles. It has managed to do this over the past few years via acquisitions and taking strategic stakes in smaller companies as well as developing its own titles. This has allowed Tencent to have an extensive portfolio of games that continue to rake in money for the company. It has also allowed Tencent to expand internationally, a feat that ByteDance is also hoping to achieve. Moonton is famous for \"Mobile Legends\" a so-called multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game where teams fight each other in large virtual arenas. Popular titles in this category include Tencent's \"Honor of Kings\" and \"League of Legends\" which was developed by Riot Games. \"Mobile Legends\" is popular in southeast Asia. And ByteDance last year partnered with gaming firm Gravity to release \"Ragnarok X: Next Generation\" in the region. \"Bytedance is taking a global approach to its video game business from day one,\" gaming analyst firm Niko Partners wrote in a note to clients.TikTok leverageByteDance operates short video app Douyin in China and TikTok in international markets. Last year, ByteDance said Douyin had 600 million daily active users and that TikTok had 700 million monthly active users. The company could use the social media platform to promote games and attract users. \"With Bytedance at the helm, the two firms (Moonton and ByteDance) could leverage TikTok / Douyin to promote Mobile Legends in markets such as China and the US where Tencent's Honor of Kings and Riots' League of Legends: Wild Rift are the dominant mobile MOBA titles,\" Niko Partners said. But ByteDance may not be able to rely on acquisitions alone to be successful in gaming. \"The biggest challenge for Bytedance will be to create a self-developed hit that it can operate over the long term. Hence why it is signing publishing deals to publish games based on popular IP and acquiring game development firms with a proven record of success,\" Niko Partners added.",

            "description": "March 24 (Reuters) - Pony Ma, the founder of Tencent Holdings, China's biggest social media and video games company, met with antitrust watchdog officials this month to discuss compliance at his group, three people with direct knowledge of the matter said.The meeting is the most concrete indication yet that China's unprecedented antitrust crackdown, which started late last year with billionaire Jack Ma's Alibaba business empire, could soon target other internet behemoths.Beijing has vowed to strengthen oversight of its big tech firms, which rank among the world's largest and most valuable, citing concerns that they have built market power that stifles competition, misused consumer data and violated consumer rights.Tencent, whose WeChat messaging and payment mobile app is ubiquitous in China, is expected to be the next in line for sharper antitrust regulatory inquiries, said the three people.News of the meeting, which has not been reported, came ahead of Tencent's December quarter results on Wednesday, in which the company reported a forecast-beating 175% rise in quarterly profit, helped by a surge in gaming revenues.Pony Ma, who seldom gives media interviews and had been out of the public eye for more than a year, was in Beijing this month for China's annual parliamentary meeting and visited the State Administration of Market Regulation (SAMR) office the week before last, said the people.The Tencent founder, ranked this month as China's second-richest person with a $74 billion fortune, is a parliamentary delegate with Guangdong province, where the company is headquartered.Tencent requested the meeting with SAMR deputy head Gan Lin and other senior officials, said the three people.Tencent and SAMR did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.At the meeting, the two parties discussed how Tencent could better comply with antitrust rules, two of the people said.Wu Zhenguo, the head of SAMR's anti-monopoly bureau, who was also at the meeting, expressed concern about some of Tencent's business practices, and asked the group to comply with antitrust rules, one of them said.SAMR is currently gathering information and looking into monopolistic practices by WeChat, and how the super app has possibly squashed fair competition and squeezed smaller rivals, two of the people said.All the sources declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.Tencent shares dropped as much as 1.7% in a weaker Hong Kong market to touch the day's lowest level after the Reuters report. The stock ended down 0.8%.CORRECTIVE ACTIONThe meeting between Pony Ma, who is also Tencent's chairman and chief executive, and the antitrust officials came a few days after he called for tighter governance of the internet economy at China's parliamentary meeting in Beijing.Pony Ma's discreet public profile is in sharp contrast to that of unrelated fellow entrepreneur Jack Ma at Alibaba, whose public criticism of China's regulators triggered a chain of events that resulted in the last minute halting of fintech affiliate Ant Group's $37 billion IPO last November.One of the people said that Tencent had not been officially notified by SAMR of any investigation into its activities, but is expecting to hear from the regulator soon.\"As one of China's big two, it's perfectly normal that Tencent felt anxiety about being targeted,\" said You Yunting, a lawyer with Shanghai-based DeBund Law Offices, referring to Pony Ma's meeting with the regulatory officials.\"There are two worries for Tencent, a concentration of undertakings review could impact acquisition deals, while investigations and litigations on abuse of dominant market positions could hurt the advantage of its platforms.\"To cushion the impact of any potential moves against it, Tencent has been scrambling to take corrective action.Tencent is having to offer concessions in a plan to merge the country's top two videogame live-streaming sites in order to resolve antitrust concerns, Reuters reported on Tuesday.In a separate deal, the firm, which held a 5% stake in local gaming firm Zhejiang Century Huatong Group, had also planned to buy another 10%, said one of the people and another person with direct knowledge, making it the largest shareholder.Earlier this month, however, Tencent acquired 5% of Century Huatong and became the second-largest shareholder instead, looking to avoid a potentially lengthy and complicated antitrust approval process, the two people said.Reporting by Pei Li, Cheng Leng and Julie Zhu; Editing by Sumeet Chatterjee, Richard Pullin and Jan HarveyOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "description": "At the start of this year, an inconspicuous German fintech announced it had raised \u20ac69m led by Tencent, one of Beijing\u2019s most preeminent tech groups.In the same breath, it was reported that China\u2019s Ant was setting up a $100m fund in Berlin to invest in Europe\u2019s fintech and blockchain startups.But these aren\u2019t one-offs. They\u2019re part of a growing trend of Chinese investors embedded in Europe\u2019s fintech story, having already funded top players like Klarna, N26 and WeFox.AdvertisementWe\u2019ve taken a deep dive into China\u2019s growing love affair with the continent, and what to expect next.We also look into which investors are leading thlile charge, and what this means for the ecosystem.Top investorsSo far, Europe\u2019s fintechs have attracted a small but powerful pool of Chinese strategic investors.The following list showcases the investors that have been the most active among European fintechs since 2010. This is based on how many rounds they\u2019ve participated in (as opposed to total amounts invested or the number of individual companies invested in).Source: Pitchbook. \u201cFintech\u201d is used here to include everything from payments, banking, investing, mortgages and lending, to cryptocurrency/blockchain.The list broadly falls into two camps: corporate VCs and crypto funds.Leading the pack is Tencent \u2014 one of China\u2019s biggest tech companies.Like Google, Tencent has a prominent venture arm, boasting over 100 unicorns globally. In Europe, it\u2019s managed by Ling Ge and Alex Leung. Tencent\u2019s most recent European fintech investment was in the German insurtech, Clark, which raised a \u20ac69m round in January.In addition, there are also countless Chinese angels, VCs and private equity firms who back fintechs indirectly, such as LPs in large European tech funds like Firstminute and Atomico. Sources say China\u2019s sovereign wealth fund has also considered becoming an LP in Europe.Chinese financiers are also linked to several key Hong Kong\u2019s investors. Among them are QBN Capital, Horizon Ventures (which backed N26 and WeFox) and Convoy, (investor in Tandem and Nutmeg).More to comeAnalysts now expect a boom in Chinese capital into the sector \u2014 fuelled by changing political and regulatory tides.\u201cThe geopolitical tension with Trump has led Chinese investors to look further afield in international markets...The investment agreement between Europe and China looks like it could open a lot of doors for investment firms,\u201d Lillian Li, a former investor at Eight Roads and a UK-China specialist, tells Sifted.Europe\u2019s strengths include strong regulators and EU rules around licence passporting, says Tao Tao, a former lead for Chinese tech giant Ant in Europe. He too predicts that tension with the US \u201cwill further benefit European fintech.\u201dEuropean fintech also offers an attractive hedge amid growing pressure at home from Chinese regulators, according to fintech analyst Alessadro Hatami.\u201cChina is going through a big moment with everything happening with Jack Ma [Ant\u2019s CEO] and an unpredictable regulator,\u201d he tells Sifted. \u201cExports are China\u2019s whole economy...they want customers...Europe is big, it\u2019s developed, and it\u2019s regulated centrally.\u201dAdvertisementEarly signsData shows that Chinese investors have already started doubling down on the sector, while diverting funding away from the US.GP BullHound found that fintech was China\u2019s top investment focus in Europe for Q1 2020.Source: GP HoundThis has been driven by the likes of Chinese fintech specialists Lingfeng Capital, who have also recently announced a \u20ac150m fund focused on Europe.The Chinese are also starting to sit in on later-stage deals in Europe, injecting tens of millions in one go. By extension, last year, Chinese investors partook in deals that provided 19% of the total raised by European fintechs, according to Pitchbook.The funding graph below also suggests that cumulatively, Chinese influence has bloomed in European fintech over the last five years \u2014 with more funding on the way.It\u2019s worth stressing however, that the Chinese still write far fewer cheques than their US counterparts. Last year, Chinese investors took part in just 2.2% of European fintech deals, albeit very important ones.Chinese investors may still be minor players in Europe, but that\u2019s set to changeThe opportunity calculusWhen it comes to fintech, China is the world leader, meaning Beijing investors aren\u2019t short of local talent.So why are they looking for here, and who will they target next?The existing pool of European fintechs with Chinese backers provides some insight into their interest.Within this, payments startups have boasted the biggest deals.\u201cPayments is the biggest focus,\u201d says Zennon Kapron, a Singapore-based finance analyst. \"The market in China is a red ocean. It's super competitive and the margins are very thin. But if you look at mature markets like Europe, the margins are much bigger,\u201d he told Sifted.Within this, Chinese investors have also learned towards Europe\u2019s consumer offering, with one exception \u2014 the UK\u2019s top digital banks.Nonetheless, infrastructure and B2B startups could be the next target. In 2019 Tencent invested in open-banking startup TrueLayer. Meanwhile, Ping An Ventures\u2019 $1bn fund pumped \u20ac41m into troubled German incubator, Finleap, as well as core banking startup 10X.Tencent declined to comment on their ambitions in Europe.In terms of geography, Kapron also predicted that Eastern Europe is deemed a welcome refuge for Chinese funds.Influencing from afarIt\u2019s little surprise that the world\u2019s second-largest economy is looking to plunge its capital into Europe tech.But China\u2019s growing influence in European tech has split opinion.In the UK, there are now calls for tougher \u2018screening processes\u2019 for Chinese investors. This builds on the dispute in the US around TikTok\u2019s use of consumer data, and fed into the government\u2019s decision to ban Ant\u2019s acquisition of MoneyGram in 2018.\u201cIt\u2019s a trojan horse,\u201d says analyst Spiros Margaris, arguing that Chinese funding in Europe is a vehicle for soft power.In a similar vein, after Ant invested in Klarna last year and took a 1% stake, The Times asked: \u201cDo we really want the Chinese accessing so much data about our spending?\u201dPolitics aside, there are also concerns about Chinese investors\u2019 protocol. London founders say they carry a reputation for \u201cpulling term sheets.\u201d The hyped \u00a3500m Chinese incubator Cocoon also quietly closed in the UK without any serious investments.Meanwhile, London fintech LendInvest mysteriously bought back its \u00a322m stake from Chinese billionaire Zhou Yahi in 2016.Still, others hail the Chinese as the key to fixing Europe\u2019s \u201cfunding gap\u201d and a way to boost valuations. A recent report estimated the UK has a \u00a32bn venture gap for scaleups, which Chinese funds could help bridge.More broadly, UK fintech champion and founder of Level 39 Eric Van der Kleij says investment deals are an opportunity for Europe to create stability with China.\u201cInvestment creates mutual dependency \u2014 it\u2019s an exchange of culture and an exchange of prosperity,\u201d he told Sifted. \u201cWe\u2019re also less likely to see copycats if the Chinese have skin in the game, and they\u2019re more likely to help European fintechs over in China, even as LPs.\u2019If that\u2019s the case however, regulators will need to get their story straight when it comes to China, says Hatami.\u201cIt\u2019s ok to have Chinese money, but not Chinese technology?\u201d",

            "description": "We have a good sense of what projects U.S. companies open source but when it comes to Chinese webscale companies, most notably the big three\u2014Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent\u2014that ecosystem is less public and not often discussed.For instance, even if you work in open source at a large company, it is unlikely you\u2019ve head of projects like X-Deep Learning, which is Alibaba\u2019s production ML framework for sparse datasets or the Mars cross-platform network component developed at Tencent. Conversely, most of our readers will have heard of open source efforts from companies including Tensorflow, which started inside Google or from Facebook with well-known projects like Hydra for application configuration or Hermes for mobile, or at AWS with its boatload of tools and platforms built internally before being released into the open source wild.There are occasional announcements from some of China\u2019s majors that cross the U.S./China divide and garner interest like Alibaba\u2019s \u201cAlink\u201d platform for machine learning data collation, for instance, but news like this is a once-per-year event at most.In short, U.S. webscale companies have been leaders in open sourcing their own tooling but the view into how similarly sized (if not larger) companies in China has been muddled. Transparency has been granted at least in part following a multi-university study that focused on China\u2019s big three tech companies and their various open source undertakings.Although it is based on a relatively small sample size for the qualitative section, it does reveal something that might be lost on us here in the U.S. China\u2019s largest web companies are emulating the West\u2019s emphasis on open source as beneficial for a host of reasons but where these companies choose to put their open source foot forward is different, as highlighted below. For instance, take a look at Google\u2019s list of open source machine learning tools or even its list for networking as part of its 1957 repositories on GitHub to Alibaba\u2019s 428 repositories for cloud-focused efforts.Work began with a collection of 1,000 open source projects from those companies with a survey from internal developers working on those projects and examined both the technical rollout of these open source initiatives and how developers at the Chinese webscale giants perceived open versus closed source development.The chart below provides a summary of where open source innovation is most rooted, but there were some other nuanced findings about how these developers undertake the open source effort, more on that momentarily. Of the 1,000 open source projects, the majority were at Alibaba (520) with 380 from Baidu and only 100 from Tencent.The dominant category of projects that were open sourced by BAT is frontend development, which accounts for 71.8% of the total. The second most common category is backend development, which takes up 10.2% of the total. Although the backend development category accounts for the second highest number of occurrences, the number of such projects is far less than the frontend development category. Conversely, operating system and management and monitoring categories have the least occurrence in our studied projects, which only account for 1.1% and 1.6% of the total, respectively.Some of the key findings include the idea that frontend projects were more likely to be open sourced and of those, most fell into the tooling and frameworks category. When it came to rationale for open sourcing, gaining \u201cfame\u201d and expanding influence and recruitment advantages were at the top of the list. Perhaps most interesting was that respondents with the most experience inside these companies were less positive about open sourcing software projects, but this response was in the minority (88% of respondents were positive about open sourcing software efforts).\u201c88% of respondents are positive towards open sourcing software projects, respondents with high experience are more negative to open sourcing, while respondents with low experience are more positive. There is also room for future research to dig in-depth on why participants with different demographics show different attitudes towards open sourcing effort, why Chinese companies prefer to open source frontend development projects, etc.\u201dAlso noteworthy is that respondents found that having an English version of the readme and in the code comments was key to internationalization and this push to make these projects international in reach is keenly felt. \u201dResults show 73% of the respondents said that they had considered internationalization of open source projects in our survey, while our project analysis shows that only 552 out of 1,000 (55.2%) open source projects have considered internationalization (i.e., including English readme files).\u201d\u201cIt implies that companies and developers need to do more things to improve open source projects\u2019 internationalization process in practice. Meanwhile, our results show that open source projects with high internationalization effort show higher popularity than projects with low internationalization effort. It also highlights the value that Chinese technology companies can reap to pursue internationalization.\u201dIf you follow open source software for cloud platforms and webscale infrastructures, test yourself: how many of these projects have you ever heard of from Alibaba versus Google\u2019s list or that from Facebook? Is it just a lack of cultural exchange/language barriers or is there something else preventing a freer exchange between open source communities among top cloud contenders?

Both mini apps have been made available on Yingyongbao, an app marketplace operated by Tencent.\u201cCloud gaming will inevitably become mainstream as 5G network coverage expands,\u201d a gaming R&D expert surnamed Yang told KrASIA on Tuesday. \u201cThis can enable game developers as they can come up with even more sophisticated pieces without worrying about the capability of players\u2019 phones.\u201dKe Yan, lead analyst at DZT Research, thinks that this new form of gaming lowers the barriers to entry. \u201cBut gaming companies need to invest in hardware for the cloud platform, so the cost for them is high,\u201d he said.Game research firm Newzoo predicts that cloud gaming will be as transformative as mobile gaming. In a report from April 2020, the firm said that the sector generated USD 158 million in global revenue for 2019 and that the market value will skyrocket to USD 5.1 billion by 2023.While Yang believes that the launch of the two cloud gaming apps is actually Tencent\u2019s early stage preparation for the future, Ming Lu, head of China Equity at Aequitas Research, considers the move to be a defensive maneuver from the Shenzhen-based gaming giant.\u201cSeveral unlisted game companies pose a certain threat to Tencent, and the most convenient way to fight back is to do full justice to its blockbusters,\u201d the analyst said.

            "description": "In late January, when the \"Nerds vs Wall Street\" battle was at its most intense on the New York Stock Exchange, one of China's most promising technology entrepreneurs was catching very few winks 13 hours away in Shenzhen.Li Hua, who also goes by \"Leaf\", personally negotiated with his dealers in the United States to unfreeze transactions so that customers of Futu Holdings' internet-only trading platform in mainland China and Hong Kong could join in the chase for the shares of GameStop, an unprofitable retailer of speciality electronic games in Grapevine, Texas.The GameStop mania wiped out US$27 billion of value in a boom-to-bust cycle in less than a month. It dragged Futu into the limelight along with the largest no-commission online broker Robinhood, when Li's customers were barred from buying additional shares in GameStop and AMC Entertainment Holdings. Even though the suspension was eased within 24 hours, the episode drew an uncomfortable comparison with Robinhood, which sells customers' online orders to high-frequency brokers or market makers like Citadel Securities. Li, founder of Futu, had envisioned creating China's Charles Schwab when he established the online broker in 2012.Get the latest insights and analysis from our Global Impact newsletter on the big stories originating in China.\"We are not like [Robinhood] because they sell order flows in exchange for letting customers trade for free,\" Li said in an interview with South China Morning Post in Shenzhen. \"That's not a business [model] that we are getting involved in, at least for now.\"Futu Holdings founder and chairman Leaf Li Hua poses for a picture at the company's head office in Shenzhen on December 9, 2020.

The number of China's share-trading accounts ballooned to 178 million in December, according to China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation, making this the world's eighth-largest cluster of people behind Nigeria's population.Story continues\"Online stock trading in China topped the world in 2018 with 31 per cent of the market, showing the steadily rising demand of investors using online channels for their transactions,\" according to First Shanghai Securities' analyst Li Jinglin, in a January 22 report. \"Compared with traditional brokerages with bricks-and-mortar shops, online brokers that focus on online trading have improved efficiency, relatively lower commission rates and fees after they cut their overheads, and they are better able to win over loyal customers with their cost advantage.\"Headquarter of Futu Holdings in Shenzhen on December 9, 2020. Photo: Iris OuyangComprising mostly millennials who came of age in 2000 or even some Gen Z traders born in the 21st century, these young customers prefer simple, do-it-yourself systems that let them trade from the convenience of their ubiquitous smartphones. Lower transaction fees were also a big plus, encouraging more traders to get in and out of positions more frequently, even with smaller wins.\"The simplicity of our service enables us to cater to all levels of customers, whether they are beginners, or experienced investors who require more in-depth features and analysis,\" Li said at his head office on Yuehai Street, one of China's wealthiest neighbourhoods measured by gross domestic product.The street, cutting through the Nanshan district in the heart of what is dubbed \"China's Silicon Valley,\" is the marquee address for the technology industry, home to such home-grown champions as Huawei Technologies, ZTE, Tencent Holdings and the drone maker DJI.A night view of Nanshan district in Shenzhen, with Tencent Holdings' building in the centre, on October 7, 2020. Photo: XinhuaThe simplicity of the model served Li well, helping Futu chalk up 10.4 million user accounts as of September 30, 10 times larger than Tiger Brokers - backed by one of China's largest smartphone makers Xiaomi - with 1 million user accounts at the end of November.Futu's commission is 0.05 per cent, with the minimum amount set at HK$50 (US$6.4) except for new users in certain periods, compared with 0.03 per cent in commission fees plus 0.03 per cent platform fees by Tiger Brokers, and 0.25 per cent by Huatai International with a minimum amount of HK$100.A decade earlier, when Li had just struck out on his own, stockbroking was a different business. Dominated by brokerages affiliated with large state-owned banks, the industry was a tightly regulated market heavily ring-fenced by rules to damp price swings, prevent capital flight and provide the population a one-way bet for ever higher prices.It was also a business that was in no rush to innovate. Investors domiciled in mainland China, collectively sitting on the world's largest currency reserves, had few avenues for trading offshore due to the nation's tightly controlled capital accounts. Until a cross-border investment channel called the Connect was established with Hong Kong in 2014, they could not trade any of the Chinese companies listed on the city's exchange, from state companies such as China Mobile Limited to tech champions such as Tencent. Trading of US-listed stocks was off-limits.Such was the market situation that drew Li, who turns 44 this year, to abandon a promising career in what would become China's most valuable company to strike out on his own.Li, who studied computer science, joined Tencent in 2000, two years after graduating from Hunan University in central China. His English name Leaf is a homophone of his Chinese name in his native Changsha dialect.Joining the then start-up, Li worked alongside Tencent's founder Pony Ma Huateng, helping to develop the QQ messaging service that helped to connect people from far-flung regions around China. QQ, still in use today by 600 million active users every month, would turn out to be one of Tencent's most successful products. After two years of working on QQ, Li was promoted to head a division at Tencent charged with creating video content.Tencent went public in 2004, raising HK$1.79 billion in an initial public offering on the Hong Kong stock exchange. The company's shares have jumped almost 200 times since going public, valuing Tencent at HK$7.08 trillion as the sixth-largest publicly traded company on earth.As a middle-ranking manager and one of the earliest employees - he was staff No. 18 - Li was rewarded with share options that turned into instant wealth. Tencent's listing in Hong Kong also gave Li an early peek at how the stock market worked, giving him first-hand experience of investing across different currencies and markets, as well as having to navigate different regulatory requirements.Frustrated with the prevailing stockbrokerage services that were cumbersome, expensive and inefficient, Li struck out to develop his own trading platform. He wanted to create a Chinese version of Charles Schwab, the pioneer of electronic trading platforms, discount brokers and no-fee trading that is now the world's third-largest asset manager behind BlackRock and Vanguard.He left Tencent in 2008 to focus on his venture, picking the date - four days after Valentine's Day - of his eighth anniversary as his last day at the company, according to his blog. He had not even told his parents about his resignation, causing them to wonder if he had been fired for misconduct, he wrote.The early days were hard, as he struggled to raise capital and to navigate the underdeveloped market for online stockbroking.\"If I was given another chance, I may not choose to start my own business,\" Li said. \"That's not to say I regret becoming an entrepreneur, but many things were far more difficult than I originally thought.\"Three years would go by, before his product was ready to launch. For Futu to progress from vision to reality, Li said he had Tencent to thank, both for eight years of working in one of China's largest technology companies, and for its financial backing.The viewing gallery of a typical stockbroking firm in Shanghai on August 2, 2019. Contrary to global conventions, China uses green to denote losses and declines, using red colour to represent gains and advances. Photo: EPA-EFE\"Most people lack the ability to believe, especially the ability to believe in the future ... Many people believe it after they see it happen,\" he said, adding that his experience at Tencent made it \"very easy\" for him to believe the future.Tencent also became one of the earliest investors in Li's start-up. China's largest publicly traded company is now Futu's second-largest shareholder, owning 18.9 per cent of its class A shares an 25.9 per cent of Class B shares.Futu is the largest of a new crop of online brokerages that embraced the constantly changing needs of their users. Besides Xiaomi-backed Tiger Brokers, Ant Group - an affiliate of this newspaper's owner Alibaba Group Holding - also has an investment in Snowball Securities.Online brokers have disrupted the traditional brokerage segment over the years, benefiting from a surge in direct financing. China recorded double-digit growth in the number of securities apps users between December 2016 and July 2020, according to iMedia Research.SCMP GraphicsFintech institutions - those technology behemoths that are venturing into financial services, like Ant Group, Xiaomi and Tencent itself - will record a bigger growth as the trading volume of global capital markets grows, while people increasingly accept online trading amid technology development, said First Securities' Li.A lower growth of new users, lower-than-expected market activities and possibly tighter regulation could pose risks for Futu, the analyst said.\"Online brokers have the advantage in costs, so traditional brokers will lose their competence if they don't diversify their businesses,\" Futu's founder said. \"Their brand franchise, experience and the accumulation of human relations should be what they must focus on.\"Futu now employs more than 1,300 around the world. Its stock has risen 15-fold since its 2019 initial public offering in New York, valuing the company at US$24.5 billion, about a fifth the capitalisation of Charles Schwab, founded half a century ago in 1971. The company's own fund, Futu Money Plus, managed more than HK$10 billion in capital at the end of 2020.GameStop's journey from boom to bust took less than a month. SCMP GraphicsThe company is making a push into the Singapore, using the country as its stepping stone to tap Southeast Asia, allowing Chinese investors to trade the region's stocks.Futu's growth has turned Li into China's 66th-weathiest billionaire, according to Bloomberg, estimating his fortunes at US$9.3 billion through a 40-per cent stake in Futu, making him the stockbroking industry's 11th-richest broker.Recriminations continue in the United States over the GameStop mania, with Robinhood's 34-year-old chief executive Vlad Tenev being called to testify to the US Congress this week about the temporary trading restriction placed on the stock. Thankfully for Li, Futu is spared the scrutiny.\"Futu is actively communicating with upstream channels to enhance trading channel capacity,\" Li said two weeks ago when the Chinese broker had to follow its US dealers in restricting transactions, adding that the company will continue to vet new customers before opening accounts and increase risk alerts to users. \"We are also planning a new round of capacity expansion in the Hong Kong market to ensure customers' orders are processed quickly and smoothly.\"This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

            "description": "HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese car maintenance service start-up Tuhu is considering a U.S. initial public offering this year, after raising up to $400 million from a funding round earlier this month, people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.Investment banks have been pitching to the company in recent weeks for the potential IPO, said five people. The company will likely opt for a U.S. stock listing as there is more liquidity and more comparable companies trading on U.S. exchanges, said three of the people.Two separate sources, however, cautioned the company, which provides services via its website, mobile app, call centre and third-party platforms, has not yet made a final decision on the IPO plan.The plan, if finalised, will add to a growing list of Chinese companies, mainly from the technology sector, launching IPOs in the United States in the past year lured by higher valuations and strong liquidity in the world's largest economy.Thirty Chinese companies listed in the United States in 2020 in deals worth $11.7 billion, a six-year high, according to Refinitiv data.There have been $2.3 billion worth of listings so far in 2021.Founded 10 years ago in Shanghai, Tuhu provides car repair and maintenance services via an online-to-offline business model. Its app links customers with over 2,400 car repair centres and 13,000 partner centres in 405 cities in China, according to Tuhu's website.Tuhu raised $300 million to $400 million from its latest fundraising at a valuation of $3.8 billion, which was led by existing investors Tencent Holdings and Sequoia Capital China, said two of the people.All the sources declined to be named as the information is confidential.A Tuhu spokesman said the company's fundraising is still ongoing and that there is still uncertainty around the plans. He added that the company has ample capital and has no clear listing plans. Tencent and Sequoia declined to comment.Tuhu raised $450 million in a funding round in 2018, which was led by Tencent, Carlyle Group and Sequoia, according to a company statement at the time. It also counts Goldman Sachs and Baidu Inc as early investors.Private equity firm FountainVest Partners is among investors in the latest fundraising, said one of the people.

Founder and CEO Rasty Turek told me that while the product has evolved from what he described as \u201ca Google-like search engine for rightsholders to find copyright infringement\u201d into a broader platform, the vision of creating a better system of managing copyright and payments online has remained the same.The startup describes its Attribution Engine as the \u201clicensing infrastructure for the Internet,\u201d bringing together the individuals and companies who own content rights, creators who might want to license and remix that content, the big digital platforms where content gets shared and the law enforcement agencies that want to monitor all of this.The product includes six modules \u2014 an asset registry, a system for identifying those assets when they\u2019re used in new content, a licensing system, a dispute resolution system, a payment system and data and reporting to see how your content is being used.Turek said that while Pex is being used by \u201cmost of the largest rightsholders in the world,\u201d the system was built to be accessible to \u201ca struggling musician out on the streets of Los Angeles\u201d who doesn\u2019t have the resources to \u201cpolice all of this content\u201d online.He also suggested that the broader regulatory environment is calling for a solution like Pex, with the European Union passing a new copyright directive that\u2019s set to take effect this year, and new copyright legislation also on the table in the United States. The EU bill was criticized for potentially prompting larger platforms to preemptively block broad swaths of content, but Turek argued, \u201cThere\u2019s so much content out there in search of an audience that this is going to be the opposite of overblocking.\u201dNot that Pex is relying entirely on regulators. Turek also said the platform is structured to balance the needs of the different groups using it \u2014 and that it has an incentive to strike that balance because its revenue comes from licensing deals, so it\u2019s focused on \u201creally being the Switzerland, really being the neutral party.\u201d\u201cWe designed all of our business around the idea that if we try to abuse the system, we lose, too,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t make money [when someone] abuses the system, we only make money when everybody plays nice.\u201dTurek also claimed that public domain and Creative Commons licenses are \u201cfirst-class citizens\u201d on the platform, and that many of the rightsholders using the Attribution Engine don\u2019t necessarily want monetary compensation: \u201cA lot of people are happy to do this for recognition. We are social animals.\u201d (Plus, recognition can lead to moneymaking opportunities.)Pex says the new funding will allow it to continue scaling the Attribution Engine.\u201cI don\u2019t believe investments are validation,\u201d Turek added. \u201cI believe they\u2019re more obligation than validation, but they do prove you are directionally correct.\u201d",

The revenue estimates were collated from data obtained from the App Store and Google Play worldwide between January 1, 2020, and January 31, 2021, and represent gross user spending.The data shows that Tencent\u2019s Honor of Kings was the top earner with a revenue of $267.3 million spent by players. The figure represents almost 22% growth from January 2020. It should be noted that most of the game\u2019s revenue emanated from China, put at a whopping 97% while Thailand contributed 1% of the game\u2019s revenue for January.The second top-earner is unsurprisingly PUBG Mobile, yet another game distributed by Tencent. The game raked in more than $259 million in gross revenue, a 26 percent year-over-year growth when compared to January 2020. About 60% of PUBG Mobile\u2019s revenue were from players in China where the game is known as Game For Peace. The United States contributed 9.8%. PUBG Mobile is still banned in India so the revenue from India would have dropped drastically.The third-highest grossing game is Fate/Grand Order from Sony\u2019s Aniplex, while the fourth spot is occupied by Genshin Impact from miHoYo. Completing the top 5 is Roblox from Roblox Corporation.Professional Baseball Spirits A from Konami was a new entrant to the overall top 10 grossing mobile games in January. The title had its best month ever, racking up $112.5 million, a more than three times increase from January 2020. By January 31, 2021, lifetime revenue had reached $1.3 billion, with Japan accounting for all player spending.

Last month, it said it would set up a smart electric vehicle (EV) company with Geely.\"Our partnership is based on the belief that end-to-end integration of hardware and software will provide the best experience for autonomous driving,\" Baidu Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Robin Li said in a conference call.Li also said Baidu has decided a CEO and brand for the EV venture, adding that the company would try to launch a new EV model in about three years.As the domestic economy recovers, the Beijing-based company's investments in non-core businesses is also helping it fend off competition to its core search platform from rivals Alibaba, Tencent Holdings and ByteDance, whose products are equally popular.Baidu said it expects current-quarter revenue between 26 billion yuan and 28.5 billion yuan, above expectations of 25.79 billion yuan.Its total revenue rose 5% to 30.26 billion yuan ($4.69 billion) in the fourth quarter, topping analysts' average estimate of 30.06 billion yuan, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Excluding items, Baidu earned 20.08 yuan per ADS, beating estimates of 16.89 yuan.Its U.S.-listed shares, which have gained more than 70% in 2020, rose 3.4% to $317 in after-market trading.However, Baidu's streaming affiliate, iQIYI, saw subscribers fall by 3.1 million to 101.7 million by December, when compared with the third quarter.The Netflix-like video-streaming website is facing competition from Tencent Video and Alibaba's Youku, calling for heavy investments on content to retain consumers.($1 = 6.4542 Chinese yuan)Reporting by Eva Mathews in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun KoyyurOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "description": "Trump\u2019s four-year stint in the White House was marked by a deterioration in relations with Beijing.The Biden administration\u2019s recent decisions to review the policies of Donald Trump toward certain Chinese companies have laid the groundwork for a step change in how Washington deals with the perceived threats posed by the Asian nation\u2019s tech firms.Under President Trump, the country aggressively sanctioned companies like Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., ByteDance Inc.\u2019s short-video app TikTok and Tencent Holdings Ltd.\u2019s social messaging app WeChat, as part of a broader effort to unwind some of the complex supply chains linking the world\u2019s two largest economies.The strategy, known as \u201cdecoupling,\u201d roiled the global tech sector. Now, however, the Biden administration seems to be signaling support for a more agile policy dubbed \u201csmall yard, high fence.\u201dThe approach, which has circulated among Beltway policy wonks for some time, does not completely reject the need to exclude some Chinese tech firms from U.S. markets. But instead of adopting Trump\u2019s scorched-earth tactics, it calls for defining in precise terms which technologies are key to American national interests and taking action to protect them from excessive Chinese influence.Which technologies are considered worthy of such protection has not been disclosed, but could include innovations like 5G and advanced semiconductors. Last week, Biden announced the creation of a military task force that will review Washington\u2019s policy toward China, including in the technology sphere.Some factors behind the shortage are related to the global economy, including a stronger-than-expected rebound of the auto sector and supply-chain issues related to the Covid-19 pandemic. But Trump\u2019s export restrictions may have also made it more difficult for chip makers both inside and sometimes even outside China to get the materials and equipment they needed to ramp up for the increased demand, exacerbating the shortage.At a press conference earlier this month, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki noted that the chip shortage was one of the specific catalysts that had prompted Biden to call for a review of Trump\u2019s policies. She said the White House would determine the source of the bottlenecks behind the shortage and work with industry to correct it to avoid hurting American workers and the country\u2019s allies.Her mention of American workers and allies disappointed some in China who had begun to speculate that the upcoming review could lead to some relief for Huawei \u2013 one of the biggest targets of Trump\u2019s assault. The former president\u2019s sanctions had taken special aim at Huawei\u2019s chip-making unit that provides core components for the smartphones and networking equipment that are its main products.Trump\u2019s four-year stint in the White House was marked by a deterioration in relations with Beijing, with the president wielding three main weapons to bash Chinese tech firms.Citing national security concerns, his administration added companies to the \u201cEntity List,\u201d which curtails access to U.S. suppliers, and to a list of firms with ties to the Chinese military that prevents them from trading their securities on American bourses.The tactic was disastrous for Huawei, whose smartphone sales have plunged since its inclusion on the Entity List in May 2019 rendered the company unable to maintain its supply of advanced microchips.In other cases, Trump targeted Chinese tech firms through executive orders. Two such proclamations taking aim at TikTok and WeChat led to long-running court battles that have so far failed to significantly restrict the platforms\u2019 operations in the United States.Finally, Trump announced a flurry of policies in the 5G and telecommunications sectors. The Clean Network Initiative, for instance, seeks to excise Chinese telecoms firms from American networks and convince like-minded governments to do the same.While the Biden administration has said it will reconsider its stance on some of the above issues, Washington\u2019s stance on Chinese tech firms will continue to center on two core interests: revitalizing domestic industry and managing national security concerns.During his election campaign, Biden pledged to take action to ensure that the U.S. would not face shortages of critical products during times of crisis. He has called for \u201cstronger, more resilient\u201d domestic supply chains in areas including energy, semiconductors, \u201ckey electronics,\u201d telecoms infrastructure and \u201ckey raw materials.\u201dOn national security, Biden appears to agree with Trump\u2019s reasoning for slapping sanctions on Chinese tech firms: namely, that foreign tech products used by large numbers of American citizens pose a potential national security threat. Where the two men differ is on how to manage that threat.On Wednesday, the Biden administration asked a federal judge to pause a lawsuit over Trump\u2019s TikTok ban while Washington reviews its China policy. The following day, the government made a similar request in a case on Trump\u2019s attempted WeChat ban. Although those lawsuits may yet proceed, the requests bode well for the future operations of Chinese social media platforms in the United States.But the outlook for Huawei, which has long defended itself against allegations that its gear may facilitate Beijing\u2019s infiltration into American telecoms networks, is less optimistic. So far, the Biden administration has said only that the Chinese tech giant\u2019s inclusion on government blacklists is subject to \u201creview,\u201d ruling out an easing of sanctions in the short term.The moves bear the hallmarks of the emerging \u201csmall yard, high fence\u201d doctrine. Washington might give a free pass to Chinese apps that let you chat to friends or scroll through cat videos. But companies with products related to critical tech infrastructure may get kicked into the wilderness.Contact reporter Matthew Walsh (matthewwalsh@caixin.com) and editor Joshua Dummer (joshuadummer@caixin.com)Download our app to receive breaking news alerts and read the news on the go.",

            "description": "ByteDance is bringing its battle with archrival Tencent to the court at a time when the Chinese government moves to curve the power of the country\u2019s internet behemoths.The Beijing Intellectual Property Court has permitted a ByteDance lawsuit brought against Tencent to proceed, a ByteDance spokesperson confirmed with TechCrunch. Upstart new media company ByteDance alleged that Tencent\u2019s restrictions on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, are in violation of China\u2019s anti-monopoly draft rules. Douyin is headquartered in Beijing while Tencent\u2019s base is in Shenzhen.For three years, Tencent has blocked Douyin from its flagship networking apps WeChat and QQ, which bans users from viewing or sharing content from the short video app. Tencent\u2019s behavior \u201cno doubt\u201d constitutes \u201cmonopolistic behavior achieved by abusing market domination to exclude and limit competition,\u201d which the proposed anti-monopoly law prohibits, Douyin, said.\u201cWe believe that competition is better for consumers and promotes innovation. We have filed this lawsuit to protect our rights and those of our users.\u201dTencent said in response the accusation is false and malicious defamation. It further asserted that Douyin, which is used by 600 million users every day, uses illegal and anti-competitive methods to access WeChat\u2019s user data, and it\u2019s planning to sue ByteDance for harming its platform ecosystem and user rights.ByteDance and Tencent each covet the other\u2019s turf. ByteDance debuted a chat app to take on Tencent\u2019s dominance in social networking, while Tencent countered Douyin\u2019s popularity by introducing a slew of short video apps. Neither has managed to threaten the other\u2019s dominance in their respective field.Early signs show that the Chinese government is increasingly willing to rein in monopolistic behavior on the Chinese internet following two decades of relatively lax regulations.In November, the country\u2019s top market regulator unveiled the draft version of its first anti-monopoly law, opening a floodgate to lawsuits and investigations. In December, regulators launched an antitrust probe into Alibaba for forcing vendors to sell exclusively on its platform. Just this month, a court in Beijing imposed a 3 million yuan ($464,000) fine on fashion e-commerce site Vipshop over anti-competitive behavior. It won\u2019t be surprising to see more Chinese internet giants getting hit by anti-trust actions in the upcoming months.",

            "description": "Tencent Holdings Ltd may be the world's largest gaming company and a Chinese internet powerhouse worth more than $900 billion, but it's also spooked. Rapidly growing ByteDance, the owner of TikTok and the similar Chinese short video platform Douyin, has made sizeable inroads into business areas Tencent holds dear - including ads, gaming, livestreaming, social media and office software.That has forced Tencent over the past year to become less of absent parent and much more hands-on with some of the 800-plus companies it has invested in, sources at Tencent and its portfolio firms told Reuters. It is now helping key firms revamp their business models to head off ByteDance while coaxing them to stop competing with each other, the sources said.To buttress its core gaming division, the Shenzhen-based company has also stepped up acquisitions and the development of casual games. \"ByteDance is pressing hard so as a defensive strategy, Tencent has to go on the offensive and at the same time exert more influence on portfolio companies to form a line of defence,\" said a Tencent executive.The executive, like other sources for this article, declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to media on the matter.NO LOVE LOSTIn 2018, ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming traded barbs with Tencent founder Pony Ma, accusing Tencent of blocking and copying Douyin, and the feud has since escalated into a volley of lawsuits. That includes a suit from Douyin last week accusing Tencent of monopolistic behaviour. Tencent said the claims were false, accused Douyin of illegally gaining user information and vowed to file more suits against ByteDance.Asked to comment on changes to its strategies and the feud, Tencent said in a statement to Reuters that ByteDance and related companies have hurt the interests of its partners and rights of its users. \"We are committed and will take legal action to protect our healthy ecosystem,\" it said.ByteDance argues WeChat users should have control of their data and the data isn't owned by Tencent. It said in a statement it was seeking to protect its rights and those of its users and that \"competition is better for consumers and promotes innovation\". Established only in 2012, Beijing-based ByteDance has become a prolific 'app factory' valued at some $180 billion. It is now 22-year-old Tencent's biggest threat, eclipsing long-time rivals Alibaba Group Holding and Baidu Inc, Tencent sources said.In 2019, ByteDance became China's second largest digital ad player behind Alibaba, leapfrogging Tencent and Baidu in the process. Its share of Chinese app users' screen time has also grown, to 15% as of end-September from 12% a year earlier, while Tencent's share fell to 41% from 45%, according to analytics firm QuestMobile.The potential for ByteDance to use Douyin and other apps to direct traffic to new business lines, similar to how Tencent leveraged its WeChat and QQ social media products, has pushed Tencent to formulate new strategies, the sources added.MAKING IT HARD FOR BYTEDANCEBest known for more sophisticated money-making titles like \"Honor of Kings\", Tencent is also now churning out simple casual games typically played on mobile phones - a segment it was once dismissive of as not very profitable, sources said. The reason? ByteDance's growing library of such games, currently over 150, that include notable hits like \"My Kungfu is Special\" and \"Rooster Defense\".Tencent has boosted its line-up with an investment last year in France's Voodoo, which already had a presence in China. Tencent then acquired Chinese firm Leyou, known for the action game \"Warframe\", but which also has many simple casual games. \"Obviously these games don't bring Tencent much revenue. The sole purpose is to just make it hard for ByteDance to succeed,\" said a ByteDance gaming executive.Tencent invested in 30 gaming firms last year compared to its usual practice of about 10 per year - a strategy aimed at preventing ByteDance, which has been working on more sophisticated games, from gaining a greater foothold in the industry, sources said. Tencent is also responsible for game-streaming firm Huya Inc's plans to acquire DouYu International Holdings - putting an end to a destructive rivalry that saw regular poaching of each other's celebrities, sources familiar with the matter said.It took action after Douyin and another rival Bilibili began gaining traction in games livestreaming services, they added. In other business areas, ByteDance's development of a search engine was a factor behind Tencent's plans to buy out the rest of search engine Sogou for $3.5 billion and take it private, one of the sources said.For majority-owned China Literature, Tencent sent one of its senior executives to lead the online reading platform and made most of its content free - moves analysts have said were made in response to the success of a rival offering launched by ByteDance. Attempts by Tencent to ward off ByteDance's encroachment of its territory could, however, become complicated by a recent antitrust review by Chinese regulators of internet firms.The gaming market remains fragmented and Tencent is less vulnerable to regulatory action there, but the overwhelming dominance of WeChat as a social media forum in China - the basis for ByteDance's latest suit - is hard to deny, lawyers say. Regulatory approval of the Huya-DouYu deal might come with the condition that other platforms be allowed to livestream Tencent-owned games, said You Yunting, a lawyer with Shanghai-based The Bund Law Office.Sources with direct knowledge of the matter have also said Tencent's Sogou deal will face a thorough review and there is a good chance it may not close as planned.Also read: Tencent sacks 100 employees, blacklists 37 firms over embezzelement, bribery incidents",

            "description": "The Ant Group is planning a major revamp in response to pressure from Chinese financial regulators, just three months after Jack Ma\u2019s outspoken remarks against them. New antitrust rules concerning tech firms went into effect on Sunday.While Ma\u2019s critical speech may have been the tipping point for the government to rein in Big Tech, there have been long-standing economic, social, and industrial policy issues that merit the government\u2019s action.In fact, Beijing\u2019s recent efforts to strengthen antitrust regulation in the tech sector are motivated by a larger goal: to become a technology superpower and achieve self-sufficiency so that China no longer needs to rely on the West.In this regard, how China handles antitrust law offers it a distinct competitive advantage, particularly compared with the U.S., which is also grappling with how to handle tech giants. Even though efforts to rein in companies such as Google and Facebook have gathered momentum, the U.S. government has significantly less leverage than China when it comes to antitrust law. Indeed, any U.S. legislative changes will take years to enact, and existing antitrust cases brought against Big Tech also face uphill battles in U.S. courts.China shares some of the same concerns as the U.S. over increasing market concentration in the tech sector. Moreover, the enormous commercial success of Chinese online tech businesses such as Alibaba and Tencent have resulted in a high concentration of wealth\u2014there are 878 billionaires in China, the highest number in the world.However, these companies do not thrive because they develop innovative technologies. Rather, they build smart apps that make it easier for consumers to connect with merchants. Even though China has emerged at the forefront of e-commerce and digital payment, Chinese Big Tech still owes its success, to a large extent, to China\u2019s vast consumer market.This ferocious competition between Chinese tech firms trying to grab larger shares of the Chinese consumer market has led to many social problems. By setting tight delivery times, the algorithms of Chinese online delivery apps encourage their drivers to speed dangerously, resulting in more traffic accidents. The recent deaths of two young employees at Pinduoduo, a rising Chinese e-retailer and formidable competitor to Alibaba, have sparked a heated debate about the culture of overworking at Chinese tech firms.What\u2019s more, despite their sophisticated software development capabilities, companies such as Tencent and Alibaba have yet to develop foundational technologies. China\u2019s fragility in technological innovation was clearly exposed during the Sino-American trade war\u2014the operations of national champions such as ZTE and Huawei could be easily interrupted if the U.S. government withheld the supply of key components such as semiconductors.China\u2019s weakness in technological innovation explains Beijing\u2019s recent emphasis on achieving technological self-reliance and its desire to push Chinese tech giants in this direction. Since China is the only country apart from the U.S. to have Internet giants, these tech firms are in a good position to develop digital technologies for the country. In some ways, Chinese tech giants have responded to the government\u2019s call. Tencent has promised to invest $70 billion in new digital infrastructure. In 2019, Alibaba unveiled its first chip to power artificial intelligence. Baidu is betting heavily on driverless cars.But Beijing wants more. Its intentions were clearly revealed in a recent editorial by the People\u2019s Daily, a Communist Party mouthpiece, which chided tech firms for investing in the \u201ccommunity group-buying\u201d market. The commentator instead urged Chinese Internet giants to forge ahead with higher ambitions, such as advancing technological innovations to clear China\u2019s bottleneck in the intensive Sino-American rivalry, rather than focusing on selling cabbages.In the meantime, antitrust law enforcement gives Beijing significant regulatory leverage to push its tech firms in the direction it desires. Antitrust law grants the central government strong sanctioning powers, allowing it to impose anything from astronomical monetary fines to severe structural remedies. The Chinese antitrust regulator also possesses vast administrative discretion while being subject to little judicial oversight. Furthermore, Chinese antitrust law enforcement is spearheaded by a central ministry that follows the central government\u2019s directives carefully.As Chinese tech giants have amassed significant market power, they have become vulnerable to antitrust regulatory attacks. And just as U.S. and EU regulators are tightening their antitrust scrutiny over Big Tech, the Chinese antitrust authority also has perfectly legitimate reasons to do so. The regulatory vulnerability of Chinese Big Tech, in turn, facilitates their cooperation with Beijing to help the latter achieve its goals, be it in antitrust or other industrial policy matters.Indeed, the Chinese government views antitrust law as a powerful multipurpose tool not only for tackling monopolies, but also for achieving a wide variety of policy objectives, such as maintaining price stability, industrial planning, and trade and foreign policy. Thus, the absence of checks and balances in Chinese antitrust enforcement, supposedly an institutional weakness, could actually be a strength for Beijing as it pushes tech giants and the country toward achieving technological self-sufficiency.Angela Huyue Zhang is the director of the Center for Chinese Law at the University of Hong Kong.

They will also cover payment services like Ant Group's Alipay or Tencent Holding's WeChat Pay.The new rules formalize an earlier anti-monopoly draft law released in November and clarify a series of monopolistic practices that regulators plan to crack down on.China's market regulator released new anti-monopoly guidelines on Sunday that target internet platforms, tightening existing restrictions faced by the country's tech giants.The rules, issued by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) on its website, bar companies from a range of behavior, including forcing merchants to choose between the country's top internet players, a long-time practice in the market.SAMR said the latest guidelines would \"stop monopolistic behaviors in the platform economy and protect fair competition in the market.\"The notice also said it will stop companies from price fixing, restricting technologies and using data and algorithms to manipulate the market.In a Q&A accompanying the notice, SAMR said reports of internet-related anti-monopoly behaviour had been increasing, and that it was facing challenges regulating the industry.\"The behaviour is more concealed, the use of data, algorithms, platform rules and so on make it more difficult to discover and determine what are monopoly agreements,\" it said.China has in recent months started to tighten scrutiny of its tech giants, reversing a once laissez-faire approach.In December, regulators launched an antitrust investigation into Alibaba Group following the dramatic suspension of the $37 billion initial public offering plan of its payment affiliate, Ant Group.At the time, regulators warned the company over practices including forcing merchants to sign exclusive cooperation pacts at the expense of other internet platforms.",

REUTERS/Tingshu Wang Acquire Licensing Rights(Reuters) - Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd said a company executive is being investigated by authorities over allegations of \"personal corruption\", after a media report said the move was linked to sharing of personal data from its popular WeChat app.The move comes amid Beijing's unprecedented crackdown on its home-grown internet platforms, which has ensnared some of its best technology innovators and private-sector champions over violations of anti-trust and data privacy rules.Any violation of customer data protection rules would pile more pressure on the local technology companies, already dealing with heightened regulatory scrutiny after years of a laissez-faire approach.The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that a Tencent executive has been held by Chinese authorities as part of an inquiry into a high-profile corruption case involving one of the country's former top law-enforcement officials.\"We can confirm that case relates to allegations of personal corruption and has no relation to Weixin or WeChat,\" Tencent said in a statement to Reuters.Citing people familiar with the matter, the Journal reported that the executive, Zhang Feng, has been under investigation by China's anti-graft inspector since last year over alleged unauthorized sharing of personal data collected by Tencent's social-media app WeChat.Tencent said in statement to Reuters that Zhang's case was not related to its international WeChat app or domestic Weixin platform. It declined to elaborate further.\"This is just one more instance of Beijing entrenching control over the large and powerful tech giants under its purview,\" LightSTream Research analyst Mio Kato, who publishes on Smartkarma, told Reuters.\"This seems like an extension of the previous anti-corruption campaign that was focused on the political structure.\"The Journal report said Zhang was suspected of turning over WeChat data to former vice public security minister Sun Lijun, who is being investigated by Beijing for undisclosed violations of Communist Party rules. (on.wsj.com/2NdMuv9)Investigators were looking at what type of data Zhang might have shared with Sun and what Sun might have done with it, the report said.ANTI-GRAFT DRIVEThe report comes as Chinese regulators and state media are becoming increasingly vocal about infringement of consumer rights by tech companies, which use personal data to drive businesses - from selling products to acquiring customers.Chinese technology companies have also come under pressure to double down on corruption investigations in recent years, as a result of President Xi Jinping's year-long anti-graft drive.Tencent said earlier this month it had fired more than 100 staff over embezzlement and bribery incidents.Shares in Tencent, which is the most valuable company in Hong Kong with more than $900 billion in market capitalization, fell as much as 1.6% after the Journal report but pulled back later to end down 0.5% in a positive broader market.Zhang was referred to as a Tencent vice president in a 2018 statement released by the municipal government of Zhangjiakou, a city near Beijing. Tencent, however, told Reuters he was not a vice president or a senior executive, without elaborating.The Journal said Zhang could not be reached for comment, and Sun didn't respond to a comment request sent through anti-graft inspectors, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) and the State Council Information Office (SCIO).The CCDI and SCIO did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.($1 = 7.7527 Hong Kong dollars)Reporting by Pei Li, Engen Tham, Donny Kwok, Scott Murdoch, Rama Venkat; Writing by Sumeet Chatterjee; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta, Simon Cameron-Moore, Gerry Doyle and Kim CoghillOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

There is reason to believe that Tencent still has a significant growth runway left, and has demonstrated resilience against a backdrop of continued US-China tensions.But the question remains whether investors recognise this potential and reward its performance thus far.DIVERSIFIED REVENUE SOURCESTencent\u2019s business is more diversified than most people think. A large portion of its revenue still comes from its online gaming arm - roughly 30 per cent, but this is down from over 50 per cent just five years ago.Today, around a quarter of Tencent\u2019s revenue comes from FinTech and business services. Roughly one-fifth comes from social network-driven entertainment like Tencent Video and WeChat Reader, and the last one-fifth comes from advertisement.Tencent is certainly more diversified than other tech giants, such as Facebook. This allows it to avoid relying on one business amid an economic slowdown or in the face of a (geopolitical) crisis.",

Tencent and the consortium members are delighted to support UMG\u2019s growth through this additional investment.\u201cTogether with Vivendi, Tencent and Tencent Music Entertainment will continue to work to broaden artist opportunities and to enrich experiences for music fans, further promoting a thriving music and entertainment industry.\u201dA separate agreement has enabled Tencent Music Entertainment to acquire a minority stake in the capital of the UMG subsidiary owning its Greater China operations.The Universal Music Group IPO seems to be on the cards within the next 12 months.\u201cFollowing the success of this significant strategic transaction, a UMG listing is planned in early 2022 at the latest. The cash generated by these transactions may be used by Vivendi to reduce its financial debt and to finance acquisitions,\u201d Vivendi said.More minority shares are expected to be sold before then.UMG\u2019s entry onto the stock market is expected to give it greater financial muscle to compete with its two major rivals, Warner Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment.In early 2020, Universal claimed it was #1 in five of the world\u2019s major music markets \u2013 the US, Japan, UK, Germany and France.It was the first time it topped Japan, significantly home of Sony Corp and parent of Sony Music.For the week of August 21 to August 27, Universal had nine of the Top 10 albums in the US on the Billboard 200. It was only the fourth time that has happened in the chart\u2019s 64-year history and all four times involved Universal.An analysis by MIDiA found that of the US$18.8 billion (A$24.5 billion) generated by the global recording industry in 2018, Universal\u2019s market share was 30.3%, Sony at 21%, Warner Music at 18.3%, and independents at 27%.Vivendi\u2019s Q3 2020 results showed that UMG\u2019s revenues, combining recorded music, publishing and merch were up 6.1% to \u20ac1.855bn ($2.94 billion).For Tencent, the increased stake will help it continue to diversify a business that\u2019s heavily focused on gaming and the Chinese market and, with various recent acquisitions, currently has a market value of more than US$11 billion (A$14.3 billion).",

The company rose to prominence that same year with the release of Don\u2019t Starve, a quirky survival game with a playful art style. The game eventually evolved into Don\u2019t Starve Together, which added multiplayer and other features to the experience. Cheng founded Klei in 2005 in Vancouver, British Columbia; the studio\u2019s other games include 2010\u2019s Shank and 2012\u2019s Mark of the Ninja.Don\u2019t Starve Together is actually where Klei\u2019s relationship with Tencent began. In 2016, Klei partnered with the company to bring Don\u2019t Starve Together to China, where the game has been wildly successful. Notably, it was the very first game to launch on the WeGame platform, Tencent\u2019s equivalent of Steam.\u201cWe looked at a lot of different companies,\u201d Cheng said in the post, \u201cand over the years, we\u2019ve worked with a large number of publishers and distributors.

            "description": "Canadian studio Klei Entertainment, the developer of indie hits including Mark of the Ninja, Don't Starve, Oxygen Not Included, and Griftlands, is indie no more. The studio announced today that Chinese gaming giant Tencent has acquired a majority stage in the company, a deal that founder Jaime \"Bigfoot\" Cheng said \"helps us navigate a changing industry, and helps us focus on what we do best: making unique experiences that no one else can.\"\"As part of this agreement, Klei retains full autonomy of creative and operations across all aspects of the studio, including projects, talent, and more,\" Cheng said on the Klei forums. \"There are some boring accounting changes that we will need to adjust to. Other than that, I will continue running the studio as before, with no changes to staffing, projects or other operations.\"Tencent is China's largest tech conglomerate, and a game industry powerhouse: It owns League of Legends studio Riot Games outright, holds a 40 percent stake in Epic Games, and has smaller stakes in Activision, Ubisoft, Paradox Interacitve, Frontier Developments, Funcom, Fatshark, and many others. It invested in 31 gaming companies in 2020, and while many were based in China the moves gave the company control over a number of studios that will be familiar to Western gamers. It acquired Leyou Technology for $1.5 billion in August 2020, for instance, which owns Warframe developer Digital Extremes and Gears Tactics studio Splash Damage, among others. The deal means that they are now all owned by Tencent.Despite its massive size, Cheng said that \"Tencent is the only company that we felt would let us retain the level of control that we demand.\" He also noted that Klei has previously worked with Tencent on all of its game releases in China since Don't Starve Together in 2016.\"Players in China make up a large proportion of the players of our games, and we have been supporting them alongside our North American operation for several years,\" he said. \"We don\u2019t expect significant operational changes for China or anywhere else in the world, but we do expect that this partnership will help us to better support our players in China.\"A September 2020 report said that after banning the WeChat app, the US government was considering similar action against Tencent. In January, however, Reuters reported that the plan, which also included Alibaba and Baidu, had been put on hold. Klei's latest game, the deck-building roguelite Griftlands, is now in Early Access on Steam and expected to go into full release later this year.Thanks, Gamasutra.",

The majority -- 23 out of 31 -- involved other Chinese companies, but there were a number of notable Western deals as well.By far, the biggest investment was the $1.5 billion acquisition of Leyou Technologies, the Chinese firm that owns Splash Damage and Warframe developer Digital Extremes.Niko notes that this past year also marked a change in Tencent's M&A strategy.\"Tencent's approach to M&A can be traditionally characterised as somewhat conservative, investing primarily in firms that have a proven hit or established product or service,\" the firm wrote.\"This year, the company has been more proactive with its investments in the gaming space.\"The report adds that Tencent has been investing in companies that are often smaller than past deals, and ones at a much earlier stage.This was attributed to increasing competition in the games space from rivals such as Alibaba and TikTok owner Bytedance -- the latter of which recently launched a games publishing arm.\"Tencent is in no danger of losing its No.1 position in the games market, but it is beginning to feel some pressure as other companies have been able to disrupt its grip on the top ten grossing games chart.\"Tencent's 2020 deals included (in chronological order):",

            "description": "Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories SaveA group of California plaintiffs has filed a lawsuit against Chinese tech giant Tencent in state court, alleging that the company\u2019s WeChat mobile app has censored and surveilled them and shared their data with Chinese authorities. Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter. ArrowRight The lawsuit, which seeks class-action status, claims that the company\u2019s practices violate the plaintiffs\u2019 free-speech and privacy rights and \u201cunjustly enrich Tencent at the expense of California WeChat users.\u201dThe case is another sign of the mounting scrutiny of WeChat, a popular communication tool in China that is also used by millions of Mandarin speakers around the globe. The Trump administration tried to ban the app in the fall, saying it posed threats to national security because it collects \u201cvast swaths\u201d of data on users and offers the Chinese Communist Party an avenue for censoring or distorting information. A federal court issued a preliminary injunction halting that ban, in response to a separate lawsuit saying the ban would harm plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment rights.In the latest lawsuit, filed in the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara County, the plaintiffs seek court injunctions to halt Tencent\u2019s alleged actions and ask that the company be ordered to pay damages to compensate them for financial loss, emotional trauma and psychological stress. Tencent subsidiaries in the United States and Singapore are named as the defendants.AdvertisementTencent\u2019s behavior \u201cchills constitutionally protected speech,\u201d the plaintiffs, including six anonymous California residents and the nonprofit group Citizen Power Initiatives for China (CPIFC), wrote in the lawsuit. \u201cIndeed, many WeChat users have told CPIFC that they feel real fear that the Party-state or its agents will retaliate against them or their family, and that, as a result, they self-censor \u2014 despite the fact that they live in California.\u201dTencent declined to comment on the lawsuit, pointing to past remarks the company has made about its WeChat operations, including that Tencent \u201coperates in a complex regulatory environment, both in China and elsewhere,\u201d and complies \u201cwith local laws and regulations in the markets where we operate.\u201dTencent is a large global company, with annual revenue of more than $50 billion. It is the world\u2019s biggest online gaming company, with large ownership stakes in U.S. companies such as Epic Games. Last year, it led a consortium that bought 10 percent of Universal Music Group.AdvertisementThe lead counsel for the plaintiffs, Times Wang of North River Law in D.C., said most of his clients had requested anonymity in the lawsuit because they fear retaliation by Chinese authorities or others. The complaint refers to them as \u201cDoe Plaintiffs 1-6\u201d and describes them as a mix of U.S. and Chinese citizens with professions including a translator, an entrepreneur and an installer of home security systems.The seventh plaintiff, CPIFC, helped organize the lawsuit after spending nearly a year interviewing WeChat users in the United States. Yang Jianli, a Chinese dissident and founder of the group, said in an interview that CPIFC, which aims to promote a transition to democracy in China, started thinking about a lawsuit after hearing frequent complaints from WeChat users in China and the United States that they were being censored or locked out of their accounts after expressing criticism of China.Yang said he views the lawsuit as a more effective way to counter Tencent than the Trump administration\u2019s proposed ban, which he said could be difficult to pull off under U.S. law.AdvertisementWang, the son of Chinese political prisoner Wang Bingzhang, specializes in legal cases involving human rights in China. Also representing the plaintiffs are civil rights lawyer Paul L. Hoffman and half a dozen lawyers from the Lanier Law Firm in Houston, including Kenneth W. Starr, independent counsel during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton.Among other things, the lawsuit alleges that Tencent has turned over California WeChat users\u2019 data and communications to Chinese authorities, censored and surveilled WeChat users in the state, suspended and blocked their accounts after they have posted material critical of China, and profited by using their data and communications to improve the company\u2019s censorship and surveillance algorithms.Share this article ShareAs on Facebook, WeChat users can send direct messages, chat in groups or post updates on their timelines. One plaintiff, who created a WeChat account using his U.S. phone number, said Tencent suspended his account after he posted \u201cpolitically sensitive information.\u201d Later, he was able to read other people\u2019s timeline posts but was not able to post updates of his own.AdvertisementWeChat also repeatedly shut down a chat group he helped set up with his fellow Chinese university alumni, the plaintiff said. One of his classmates, still living in China, said security agents there summoned him to discuss the group\u2019s activities and asked him about the group\u2019s overseas members, the lawsuit says.Another plaintiff, who works as a massage therapist, said his account was suspended for 42 days in early 2020 after he posted messages about the coronavirus pandemic. As a result he was unable to communicate with clients and lost about $500 a day in business, he said. A third plaintiff, who runs a jewelry business, said that after she made political comments on WeChat, she was locked out of a group she created to discuss jewelry with clients, causing her to lose business.Plaintiff No. 4 said some of her posts have prompted Tencent to send her warnings that \u201ccontinued posting will lead to adverse actions being taken against her account.\u201d For example, in 2020 \u201cshe received warnings against posting and forwarding content relating to the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d the lawsuit says. And several of the chat groups to which she belongs have been suspended by WeChat \u201cbecause of their content, which Tencent monitors, censors, and surveils,\u201d the lawsuit says.AdvertisementPlaintiff No. 6 said he created a WeChat account using a U.S. phone number \u201cbecause his understanding was that doing so would avoid censorship and surveillance. Yet, to his chagrin, that wasn\u2019t true,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. After posting \u201canti-CCP content,\u201d his account has been suspended several times. And although it is currently unblocked, his friends and family in China cannot see his posts or messages. \u201cNo notice was given to Doe Plaintiff 6 that his account was being treated this way,\u201d the lawsuit says.The plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are similar to those that WeChat users in North America shared with The Washington Post recently. Those users, too, complained of being censored and locked out of their U.S.-registered accounts after posting information critical of China.The lawsuit also cites research published last year by the University of Toronto\u2019s Citizen Lab showing that WeChat was subjecting overseas accounts to surveillance to train algorithms used to censor information in China.Advertisement\u201cWe show that files and images shared by WeChat users with accounts outside of China are subject to political surveillance, and this content is used to train and build up the censorship system that WeChat uses to censor China-registered users,\u201d the Citizen Lab researchers wrote.Asked about that report in December, Tencent spokesman Sean Durkin said: \u201cWith regard to the suggestion that we engage in content surveillance of international users, we can confirm that all content shared among international users of WeChat is private.\u201dChinese authorities require Tencent to heavily censor the app inside China. Posts about Chinese politics \u2014 and many other topics \u2014 disappear when they are sent to or from a China-registered account. Chinese authorities have used the app to monitor political dissidents and other critics, some of whom have been detained by police or sentenced to prison for their communications.AdvertisementThat censorship is not limited to China, however. If a Chinese student or worker moves abroad and continues using an account created in China, the censorship will remain, according to Jeffrey Knockel, a research associate at the Citizen Lab, which studies information technology and human rights.Durkin confirmed that an account created in China will always be treated as a Chinese account, even if the user moves abroad and accesses it from an overseas device. He said the company considers accounts created inside and outside China to be \u201cseparate but interoperable\u201d and subject to \u201cdifferent regulatory environments.\u201dYet users who created their accounts in the United States also complain of censorship and inexplicably blocked accounts. Wang, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, said all users in the United States should be free from censorship.\u201cWe\u2019re saying it should be where you physically are that matters,\u201d he said.",

REUTERS/Thomas Suen Acquire Licensing RightsBEIJING (Reuters) - Beijing-based ByteDance recently launched its own third-party payment service for Douyin, the Chinese version of its hit short video app TikTok, as it presses to expand into the e-commerce business in China.\"The set-up of Douyin Pay is to supplement the existing major payment options, and to ultimately enhance user experience on Douyin,\" Douyin said in a statement to Reuters on Tuesday.Users of Douyin, which accumulated 600 million daily active users, previously could use Ant Group's Alipay and Tencent Holdings' WeChat Pay, the country's two ubiquitous third-party mobile payment channels, to buy virtual gifts for livestreamers or items from shops on the platform.Local Chinese media reported on Tuesday that Douyin Pay had been launched.ByteDance founder and Chief Executive Zhang Yiming built up the company's payment capability in China by acquiring Wuhan Hezhong Yibao Technology Co last year. Hezhong Yibao obtained a third-party payment license from the central bank in 2014.ByteDance has been ordered by the outgoing Trump administration to divest TikTok's U.S. assets on national security concerns.The company, which denies the allegation, has been in talks for months with Walmart Inc and Oracle Corp to shift such assets into a new entity.Douyin is the main revenue generator for ByteDance. It provides a glimpse of what TikTok could eventually become, as Douyin started selling merchandise in 2017 and now operates a growing e-commerce operation where hundreds of millions of users shop on a daily basis.ByteDance's expansion comes as China's financial regulators are tightening oversight over financial technology firms, particularly companies such as Ant Group.China's third-party payment sector is dominated by Alipay and WeChat Pay, with the former taking 55.39% of the total market in the second quarter of last year, according to market researcher Analysys. Other players include JD.com's JD Pay, Baidu Wallet and Meituan Pay.Reporting by Yingzhi Yang in Beijing and Brenda Goh in Shanghai; Editing by Steve OrlofskyOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

WhatsApp has amassed over 450 million users in India, its biggest market by users.Mittal described opportunities in building virtual worlds as a \u201cmuch better approach for today\u2019s world that is unconstrained by cheap, fast data and powerful smartphones.\u201dThe end of Hike\u2019s messenger service comes at a time when Signal and Telegram have added tens of millions of users in recent weeks. A planned update to WhatsApp\u2019s data-sharing policy has prompted many of its loyal fans to explore alternatives this month. \u201cBoth [Telegram and Signal] are very good. As entities they have the right incentives (more aligned with consumers) unlike Facebook products,\u201d tweeted Mittal earlier this month.In recent years, Hike made bets on stickers and emojis to cater to the younger population in India. In a meeting with TechCrunch in late 2019, Mittal said that the startup was overwhelmed with the engagement stickers on its platform and was working to automate development of personalized stickers.In a different meeting last year, Mittal showcased emojis that replicated human expressions and a virtual hangout place called HikeLand. Vibe is the rebranded version of HikeLand and the emojis Hike developed will continue to be available to users on both the newer apps, Mittal said earlier this month.Hike, which has raised more than $260 million to date, had enough runway last year, Mittal said, who hinted that the startup may raise more capital a year later.Hike also attempted to build its own operating system through acquisition of a startup called Creo. In 2018, Hike launched Total OS that aimed to cater to users with low-cost Android smartphones and slow internet data.The startup later shut down the project. Mittal told TechCrunch that the arrival of Reliance Jio, which prompted Airtel and Vodafone to lower mobile data tariff on their networks, solved the data issues in the country and Total OS was no longer needed in the market.",

it's also about the concern that he could be a threat to CCP rule,\" he said. \"It's not just about economics; he may be seen as a political threat.\"\"Politics trumps everything, as far as the CCP is concerned; it has always been their top consideration,\" Law said.Feng Chongyi, an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), drew parallels with banking tycoon Xiao Jianhua.\"This is similar to [what happened to] Xiao Jianhua; [like Xiao, Ma] may also be under house arrest,\" Feng said.\"All we can be sure of on the outside is that he is under a travel ban ... but many people think he is under restrictive measures,\" he said. \"If that's the case, then they will be investigating all of Alibaba's finances and operations, shareholders, and so on.\"Investigations under wayIndustry analysts have told RFA they believe that the investigations will result in the nationalization of both Ant Group and Alibaba.Central government investigators had already set up camp in Alibaba headquarters by the end of November, according to industry sources.The company will also be called to follow-up meetings with the People's Bank of China, the China Banking Regulatory Commission, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange after regulators slammed the brakes on Alibaba's New York listing in early November.Investigative teams are also in place at the offices of social media giant Tencent and e-commerce company Meituan.Analysts say the Alibaba investigation will help the CCP to form future policy towards the country's tech giants.State media have been keen to paint the government's targeting of Ma's tech empire as a campaign to subject the nation's super-rich to public scrutiny and regulation.CCP general secretary Xi Jinping unveiled plans at the end of October to move China to a state-controlled, \"circular\" economy based on domestic demand, and away from the export-based model that has fueled rapid growth since 1979, when late supreme leader Deng Xiaoping ushered in four decades of market-based economic policy.Analysts have said there is a widespread expectation that Xi will move to change the current system of property ownership.Reported by Gao Feng for RFA's Mandarin and Cantonese Services.

REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo Acquire Licensing RightsLONDON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - The threat of a $1 trillion U.S. sanctions hit on the Chinese internet giants that have led emerging market stocks to their first record high since 2007 is overshadowing the rally, just as increased scrutiny from Beijing itself squeezes valuations.U.S.-Sino tensions ratcheted up in recent days as outgoing President Donald Trump's administration pushed through a ban on Americans investing in 35 firms it considers to be linked to China's military. read moreSources in Washington last week said Trump was considering adding Alibaba (9988.HK) and Tencent (0700.HK), worth a combined $1.3 trillion, the second and third biggest EM stocks in the world and held by almost every major U.S. investment fund, to the list of banned firms. read moreTargeting China's two most valuable companies would be the most dramatic step yet against the country's firms as Trump seeks to cement his hardline policy against Beijing during his final days in office.Goldman Sachs estimates that U.S. investors hold roughly $1 trillion of Chinese internet and tech stocks, or have U.S. listings known as American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) that Washington has also been clamping down on.\"To unwind 1 trillion of investment (if Alibaba and Tencent were removed) is a lot!\" said Vivian Lin Thurston, a portfolio manager and Chinese equity analyst at William Blair Investment Management.\"It would be unprecedented,\" she added. \"It hasn't happened before in any global market.\"Swiss bank UBS calculates that just over a third of Alibaba's $616 billion market cap is held by U.S. investors, while 12% of Tencent's $35 billion value is.The two firms also account for almost 11% of MSCI's $7 trillion Emerging Market index (.MSCIEF) which they respectively joined in 2015 and 2008. Chinese firms now make up 40% of the index, up from just 17% a decade ago.THE BIG UNWINDGlobal index providers such as MSCI, S&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell as well as the New York Stock Exchange have been forced to eject high profile firms on Trump's list like China Mobile (0941.HK), China Telecom (0728.HK) and semiconductor giant SMIC (0981.HK) from their top benchmarks. read moreWilliam Blair's Lin Thurston explained how those removals then trigger a wave of selling by investment funds that passively track the indexes.\"As soon as it is delisted - bang it's gone,\" she said referring to the need to shed the stocks.While incoming President Joe Biden could reverse the ban, analysts at UBS say the new administration may not want to appear \"soft\" on China.Neither Biden nor his team have commented on the matter, but a reversal still wouldn't undo the billions of dollars of disruption already caused.Chinese investors have swooped in to buy up some of the offloaded shares but may struggle to absorb everything if things snowball. read moreGoldman Sachs (GS.N) estimates there would be a $28 billion selloff if every international fund tracking MSCI's main global (.MIWD00000PUS), emerging market (.MSCIEF) or Asia indexes (.MIAP00000PUS) were to liquidate holdings of the 42 Chinese firms its views as at risk, not including Tencent or Alibaba.It and fellow Wall Street banks JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Morgan Stanley (.MS.N) have also said they will withdraw as many as 500 Hong Kong-listed structured products they had issued linked to the Chinese firms. read moreANT PROBLEMSThe Trump administration has had both Tencent and Alibaba's financial technology affiliate Ant Group in its crosshairs for some time.Just last week, Trump signed an executive order banning U.S. transactions with Alibaba's Alipay mobile payment app and Tencent's WeChat and QQ Wallet over concerns they could be used to \"track the locations of federal employees\" and \"build dossiers of personal information\". read moreChina's foreign ministry responded saying the U.S. was abusing its power and unreasonably suppressing foreign firms with the measures.Tencent and Alibaba have declined to comment.In early November, it was Beijing itself though that rattled investors after the surprise suspension of Ant Group\u2019s $37 billion public listing, set to be the world\u2019s largest stock market debut, with just days to go.Alibaba (9988.HK), which owns about a third of Ant, has seen its market value shrink by more than a quarter since the IPO was shelved and regulators zeroed in on its business model, although it is still among the biggest 10 companies globally with a valuation of more than $600 billion.Some fund managers considered Beijing's move a sensible one as Ant, a major online lender, lacked adequate capital buffers. But others like Aviva Investors' Head of Global Emerging Market Equities Alistair Way are concerned.\"We have become rather more nervous about the regulatory climate in China and the seeming desire to reduce competitive dominance of big e-commerce players such as Alibaba,\" he said.\"In aggregate we have been reducing exposure to Chinese internet firms.\"Standard Life Aberdeen senior investment director Nick Robinson is also unsure.\"It feels unlikely at the moment that they (Alibaba and Tencent) will be added to the blacklist, but so far it hasn't been right to bet on a de-escalation.\"\"So could it happen? Absolutely. And if it does happen it could be quite significant.\"Additional reporting by Alun John in Hong Kong; Editing by Kirsten DonovanOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

The report cited several people familiar with the matter.The U.S. government blacklisted 31 Chinese companies in November over concerns that they support Beijing's military through an executive order. U.S. officials have been discussing expanding the executive order to expand the blacklist, the Journal's sources said.When the Hong Kong stock exchange closed, Tencent's share price was down 4.69% to 568.5 Hong Kong dollars, while Alibaba's share price was down 3.91% to 221 Hong Kong dollars.In premarket trading, U.S.-listed shares of Tencent were down 2.8% and Alibaba 's were slightly in the red.If they do get added to the U.S. blacklist, then American investors won't be able to trade their stocks as on Monday. Those who already own shares in the companies would have until November to unload them.Trump signed an executive order shortly after losing the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden in November and it is already having consequences. The New York Stock Exchange confirmed on Wednesday that it plans to delist China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom.On Tuesday, the Trump administration moved to ban Chinese payments apps including Alipay and WeChat Pay, which are linked to Alibaba and Tencent respectively.In December, the U.S. added Chinese drone company DJI and Semiconductor Manufacturing International to a trade blacklist. The Commerce Department said the action against SMIC \"stems from China's military-civil fusion doctrine and evidence of activities between SMIC and entities of concern in the Chinese military industrial complex.\"Alibaba's battles extend beyond the U.S. and to its home turf, where Chinese regulators have recently launched an antitrust investigation against the company.Jack Ma, Alibaba's founder and CEO, is keeping a low profile and hasn't been seen in public since October after he appeared to criticize Chinese regulators.Tencent declined to comment and Alibaba did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.",

(AFP photo)HONG KONG \u2014 Shares in China's two biggest companies Alibaba and Tencent tumbled in Hong Kong on Thursday in response to media reports that the Trump administration plans to press ahead with a ban on Americans investing in them.E-commerce titan Alibaba sank almost four per cent and internet powerhouse Tencent shed 4.7 in morning trade after the Wall Street Journal said officials in multiple government departments were assessing the impact of an investment ban.Such a move would be another blow to Alibaba, which has come under pressure from Chinese officials as regulators launch an anti-monopoly probe into it, while its fintech giant Ant Group was ordered to drastically change its business model.The moves come as Beijing puts the squeeze on the once unbridled empire of tech tycoon Jack Ma.The Wall Street Journal report came the same day the New York Stock Exchange reversed course for a second time to say it would delist three Chinese telecom equities from trading owing to new US government guidance.Wednesday's announcement capped a dizzying few days of flip-flopping in which the stock exchange announced the removal at the weekend before making a U-turn on Monday, and then saying it would go ahead once more Wednesday.The latest decision came after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin disagreed with Monday's reversal.The three state-owned telecom giants plunged, with China Unicom shedding more than 11 per cent while China Telecom was down more than nine per cent and China Mobile slipped more than seven per cent.Trump issued an executive order in November banning Americans from investing in Chinese companies deemed to be supplying or supporting the country's military and security apparatus, earning a sharp rebuke from Beijing.On Tuesday night he signed an executive order banning transactions involving Alipay, WeChat Pay and other apps linked to Chinese companies, drawing strong criticism from Beijing.Alipay is owned by Alibaba and WeChat is owned by Tencent.The Wall Street Journal reported that officials at the State Department, Department of Defense and Treasury Department had all discussed how to implement an investment ban on the two Chinese e-commerce giants.Any ban could have a profound effect on US markets.While the three Chinese telecoms firms are comparative small fry for the New York Stock Exchange, Alibaba and Tencent are China's two largest companies.At $1.4 trillion, the combined market value of their primary listings is twice the size of Spain's stock market, according to Bloomberg News.\"If the bans are implemented then it'd be a huge thing for the market,\" Steven Leung, executive director at Uob Kay Hian (Hong Kong) told Bloomberg.\"It's still too early to say. After the Biden administration starts, the policy could change again.\"",

            "description": "FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump departs on travel to West Point, New York from the South Lawn at the White House in Washington, U.S., December 12, 2020. REUTERS/Cheriss May//File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights(Reuters) - Outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump has toughened his stance towards Beijing in the final months of his presidency with a slew of measures targeting Chinese companies.Here is an outline of moves so far, the fallout in financial markets and China's response:DELISTING THREAT* Trump signed the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act into law on Dec. 18. It allows U.S. authorities to remove foreign firms from stock exchanges if they fail to comply with U.S. audit rules for three years.* It applies to companies from any country, but can require firms to disclose any Chinese Communist Party members on their boards and is seen aimed at Chinese firms with U.S. listings, such as Alibaba, Pinduoduo, PetroChina, Netease and JD.Com.* Investors have been shifting their holdings in such firms out of the United States, if other listings are available.INVESTMENT BANS* On Nov. 12, Trump signed an executive order barring U.S. investors from buying exposure to firms deemed linked to the Chinese military after November 2021.* The list of \"Communist Chinese Military Companies\" was mandated by a 1999 law requiring the Pentagon to compile a catalogue of companies \"owned or controlled\" by the People's Liberation Army, but it was only drawn up in 2020.* Companies such as SMIC, China's biggest chipmaker, oil company CNOOC and surveillance firm Hikvision are among the 35 on the list, but have denied military links. (See this FACTBOX for others:)* On Jan. 6, sources told Reuters and the Wall Street Journal that the Trump administration was considering adding tech giants Alibaba and Tencent.SOFTWARE BANS* On Jan. 5, Trump signed an executive order banning transactions with eight Chinese software applications, including Ant Group's popular Alipay.* The Commerce Department will define which transactions will be banned within 45 days of Jan. 5.* In August, Trump had sought to ban some transactions with WeChat and the Chinese-owned video app TikTok, although U.S. courts have so far blocked these plans.TRADE RESTRICTIONS* On Dec. 18 the United States added dozens of Chinese firms to an \"entity list\" that restricts their ability to trade with U.S. companies.* SMIC and drone maker SZ DJI Technology were among the additions to a list that since 2019 included Hikvision and Huawei Technologies.MARKET REACTION* Money managers say selling of banned shares by U.S. investors could weigh on prices in the short term, but do not see big consequences yet and say that fine print could allow them to get around some of the trade restrictions.* Index makers FTSE Russell, S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI have removed some of the listed firms from index products, weighing on their share prices as passive investors sell. (See this FACTBOX for details:)* The New York Stock Exchange said it would delist China Mobile, China Telecom Corp and China Unicom on Jan. 11 and index providers say they will delete them, prompting heavy share price drops.* Tencent and Alibaba shares also fell after it was reported that the U.S. may extend investment bans to them.* Investors have shifted holdings of Chinese firms out of U.S. listings, saying there is a risk that more Chinese companies could be affected.* Elsewhere widely-held securities such as SMIC's Hong Kong shares have seen modest price pressure, while others such as Hikvision have gained in recent weeks. CHINA'S RESPONSE* China has described the U.S. moves as wanton oppression of its companies, said they lack evidence and asked the United States to cease abusing the concept of national security.* In response to reports of sanctions extending to Tencent or Alibaba, China said it would take necessary measures to safeguard companies' rights and interests.* Hikvision has called its inclusion on the Defense Department list \"groundless\" and other firms have issued similar strongly-worded statements.Compiled by Tom Westbrook in Singapore; Editing by Alex Richardson and Shailesh KuberOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "description": "It\u2019s no secret that Tencent, the Chinese tech giant behind WeChat and a handful of blockbuster video games, is an aggressive investor. Even during 2020 when the pandemic slowed down economic activity in many parts of the world, Tencent was charging ahead with its investment ambitions.During the year, the company participated in more than 170 funding rounds that amounted to a total of 249.5 million yuan ($38 million), according to the Chinese startup database ITJuzi. That made 2020 the most active year to date for Tencent\u2019s investment team, which had been delivering superior results in the last decade.By January 2020, more than 70 of Tencent\u2019s 800 portfolio companies had gone public and more than 160 of them surpassed $100 million in valuation, Martin Lau, Tencent\u2019s president, told a room of investees at the time. The achievement could well place Tencent side by side with some of the world\u2019s top venture funds.Tencent established an investment and M&A unit back in 2008 and began to seriously ramp up financing around 2012. Since 2015, it has been funding more than 100 companies per year, ITJuzi data shows.The social and entertainment giant has for long kept its funding activity close to its chest and data gleaned by third-party organizations like ITJuzi is often not exhaustive. The company did not immediately respond to TechCrunch\u2019s questions about its investment in 2020, and the story draws mainly from public disclosures and interviews with people of knowledge.B2B interestWhile Tencent\u2019s overall investment strategy has remained consistent \u2014 a diversifying portfolio with a focus on digital entertainment \u2014 it has quietly stepped up efforts in areas outside its main gaming arena. For instance, the firm has paid more attention to enterprise services ever since it announced a B2B pivot in 2018, putting more focus on cloud computing, fintech and the likes. The number of investments it made in enterprise software went from five in 2015 to 28 in 2020, according to ITJuzi.In line with its new focus on enterprise, Tencent has also upped its game in fintech. In 2019 and 2020, it backed 18 and 15 fintech startups, respectively, ITJuzi shows, up from only four in 2015. The rise, though incremental, reflects the firm\u2019s increased interest in an area that\u2019s both hugely lucrative but also comes with many constraints.In China, Tencent has long been competing with Ant Group, the Alibaba fintech affiliate, to court users in payments, lending, wealth management and even insurance. The regulatory troubles facing Ant are not exclusive to the Jack Ma empire and will likely come to daunt its smaller contenders, including Tencent\u2019s fintech segments.That said, Tencent is \u201cnot nearly as aggressive\u201d as Ant when it comes to strengthening its position in China\u2019s financial market, a person who partners with Tencent\u2019s overseas fintech business told TechCrunch.Fintech overseasThe company is also prudent with its fintech expansion overseas in times of geopolitical tensions. So far, it\u2019s mostly limited its ambition to providing cross-border payment services to China\u2019s outbound tourists, rather than serving locals directly.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of scrutiny around what Tencent and Alibaba are doing within the United States and that presents challenges,\u201d said the CEO of a Tencent-backed startup based in the U.S. who declined to be named.Through investments, however, Tencent has familiarized itself with the foreign financial markets. In 2015, the company made one fintech investment outside China. In 2020, it funded eight, according to public data collected by Crunchbase.A considerable portion of Tencent\u2019s outside investments doesn\u2019t bear strategic significance, and the company tends to let its portfolio startups operate autonomously. Partly for that reason, Tencent was slammed for prioritizing investment and financial return over product development and innovation in a viral article in 2018, titled ominously \u201cTencent Has No Dream.\u201d The hands-off attitude is a stark contrast to the stranglehold practice of Alibaba, which prefers buying controlling stakes in businesses and shaking up their top management, as it did for Lazada.But many Tencent investments do add value to its business, even when the press announcements leave out the potential strategic synergies. Over the years, Tencent has made a series of small investments in the U.S. and other Western countries. Few of them appear to bring collaborative opportunities in the near term, but Tencent would still invite executives from these companies to China where they would learn from each other.\u201cTencent made those investments really just to kind of learn what people are doing in the U.S. and how it might be able to be applied in China,\u201d said the executive from the Tencent-backed startup.\u201cWe don\u2019t have any near-term plans to do anything in China. But Tencent is a very reputable name, whether it\u2019s in China or the U.S. And you know, it\u2019s good to have the option to be able to do something more strategic in partnership with Tencent down the road.\u201dTencent\u2019s fintech investments outside China could also be conducive to the firm\u2019s gaming expansion overseas, according to a Hong Kong-based fund manager. The goal is to have half of its gamers to be overseas users, Tencent pledged in 2019.\u201cFor the gaming industry in Latin America and Southeast Asia, the biggest bottleneck is, surprisingly, not hardware but payments,\u201d the fund manager told TechCrunch. \u201cOf course, localization and compatibility are also important.\u201d",

REUTERS/Thomas Peter/File Photo Acquire Licensing RightsWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order banning transactions with eight Chinese software applications, including Ant Group's Alipay mobile payment app, the White House said, escalating tensions with Beijing two weeks before President-elect Joe Biden takes office.The move, first reported by Reuters, is aimed at curbing the threat to Americans posed by Chinese software applications, which have large user bases and access to sensitive data, a senior administration official told Reuters.The order argues that the United States must take \"aggressive action\" against developers of Chinese software applications to protect national security.It tasks the Commerce Department with defining which transactions will be banned under the directive within 45 days and targets Tencent Holdings Ltd's QQ Wallet and WeChat Pay as well.The order also names CamScanner, SHAREit, Tencent QQ, VMate which is published by Alibaba Group subsidiary UCWeb, and Beijing Kingsoft Office Software's WPS Office.\"By accessing personal electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, and computers, Chinese connected software applications can access and capture vast swaths of information from users, including sensitive personally identifiable information and private information,\" the executive order states.Such data collection \"would permit China to track the locations of federal employees and contractors, and build dossiers of personal information,\" the document adds.China will take necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights of companies in view of the Trump order, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular briefing on Wednesday, adding that the U.S. was abusing its national power and unreasonably suppressing foreign companies.In a statement late on Wednesday, China's Ministry of Commerce said the U.S. ban goes against fair competition.It also harms the interests of Chinese companies and their customers, including those in the United States, who had \"widely welcomed\" the apps as a contactless payment option during the pandemic, the ministry added.Kingsoft said in a statement published by Chinese state media that it did not expect Trump's order to substantially impact the company's business in the short term. Ant, the Biden transition team and SHAREit declined to comment.Alibaba, Tencent, CamScanner and the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The order aims to cement Trump's tough-on-China legacy before the Jan. 20 inauguration of Biden, a Democrat, who has said little about how he plans to address specific tech threats from China.Biden could, however, revoke the order on the first day of his presidency, though his transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter.The order will likely ratchet up tensions further between Washington and Beijing, which have been locked in a bitter dispute over the origins of the coronavirus and a Chinese crackdown on Hong Kong.Despite the 45-day time line laid out by the order, the Commerce Department plans to act before Jan. 20 to identify prohibited transactions, another U.S. official told Reuters.The directive mirrors Trump executive orders signed in August directing Commerce to block some U.S. transactions with WeChat and the Chinese-owned video app TikTok.Had those orders gone into effect, they would have effectively banned the Chinese apps' use in the United States and barred Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's app stores from offering them for download for new users.The restrictions, however, were blocked by courts mainly on freedom of speech grounds. The White House is confident the new restrictions will stand up to judicial scrutiny, since applications like Alipay would struggle to bring a First Amendment case, the senior administration official told Reuters.U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said in a statement that he supports Trump's \"commitment to protecting the privacy and security of Americans from threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party.\"Alipay has been in Washington's cross hairs for months.Reuters reported in November that the U.S. State Department had submitted a proposal to add Ant Group to a trade blacklist in order to deter U.S. investors from taking part in its lucrative initial public offering. But the Commerce Department, which oversees the blacklist, shelved the proposal after Alibaba Group Holding Inc President Michael Evans urged Ross to reject the bid.Ant is China's dominant mobile payments company, offering loans, payments, insurance and asset management services via mobile apps. It is 33% owned by Alibaba and controlled by Alibaba founder Jack Ma, but is currently unavailable for American users.Alipay was downloaded from Apple's U.S. app store and Google Play 207,000 times in 2020, while image scanning app CamScanner and office suite app WPS Office were downloaded 4.4 million and 563,000 times respectively, according to research firm SensorTower.Tuesday's move is the latest in a raft of tough new curbs on Chinese companies.The White House unveiled an executive order in November banning U.S. investment in alleged Chinese military companies including China's top chipmaker SMIC and oil giant CNOOC. Last month, the Commerce Department added dozens of Chinese companies, including Chinese drone manufacturer SZ DJI Technology Co Ltd, to a trade blacklist.Reporting by Alexandra Alper and David Shepardson in Washington; Additional reporting by Brenda Goh and Josh Horwitz in Shanghai; Pei Li in Hong Kong and Gabriel Crossley in Beijing; Editing by Matthew Lewis, Leslie Adler, Lincoln Feast and Giles ElgoodOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "description": "DXY, a 20-year-old online healthcare community for Chinese consumers and healthcare organizations like Pfizer, announced this week that it has raised $500 million in its Series E round led by private equity firm Trustbridge Partners.Existing backer Tencent and Hillhouse Capital\u2019s early-stage focused GL Ventures also participated in the round, which lifted the firm\u2019s total funding to over $680 million to date. DXY\u2019s earlier investors include Xiaomi founder Lei Jun\u2019s Shunwei Capital, and DCM.The company started out as a knowledge-sharing platform for doctors and has over time added a consumer-facing aspect by bringing wellness advice and medical consultation services to the public \u2014 that is, steps that patients can take at home before having to go to the hospital.As the pandemic took hold, hospitals and people around the world rushed to shift their activities online, spurring demand for healthcare apps. DXY responded swiftly and was among the first in China to introduce a real-time COVID-19 tracker at the beginning of the outbreak.Today, healthcare organizations can also use DXY as an advertising channel, a learning platform as well as a recruiting site, ways for the company to generate revenue.Since its inception, the site has attracted some 130 million consumers, more than 9,000 medical institutions, and 50,000 doctors who have provided online consultation. The platform has a current user base of 20 million and counts Eli Lilly, Pfizer and AstraZeneca among its major clients.DXY plans to spend its new proceeds on buttressing the two pillars of its business \u2014 support for healthcare professionals and services for consumers. It will do so by strengthening cooperation with hospitals, consumer goods enterprises and pharmaceutical companies, including jointly funding R&D in products or new consumer applications.On the consumer front, the company faces some strong opponents in China including the likes of SoftBank-backed Ping An Good Doctor, Alibaba Health, JD Health and WeDoctor, which is also backed by Tencent.The article updated with more details on the investment. It previously incorrectly stated that Legend Capital was an investor.",

            "description": "\u201cAt the end of the day, it is a competition of technological strength in the EV industry,\u201d said Cao Hua, a partner at the private equity firm Unity Asset Management. \u201cIt is important for them to have powerful backers who can offer both financial and technological support.\u201dBehind this rivalry is an equally intense battle between the country\u2019s top technology companies \u2013 e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding, social media juggernaut Tencent Holdings and search engine Baidu Inc. The trio has financially backed newcomers like NIO, Xpeng and WM Motor, plying them with technology which they hope will create synergies between them and define the future of mobility.China\u2019s electric vehicle (EV) industry may be witnessing intense rivalry among a handful of promising start-ups churning out new models and boosting production to cater to the demands of the world\u2019s largest electric car market.Although none of these EV start-ups has been profitable so far, each has raised billions of dollars from the online tech giants as they look to put their technology in internet of things, 5G, cloud services and artificial intelligence to use in autonomous driving, navigation and in-car entertainment. The race is to define and set the industry standard and generate a steady stream of revenues either through licensing their technology or through digital subscription services.01:21 Nio enhances production efficiency amid rising orders for its electric-powered SUVs Nio enhances production efficiency amid rising orders for its electric-powered SUVsIn this pursuit, the EV makers and their backers have the support of the Chinese government, which wants the country to lead the world in such technologies by 2025 and wants to see 30 per cent of cars sold by then to have smart connectivity.According to a 2019 study by McKinsey & Co, Chinese digital giants will dominate in-car connectivity operating systems, and develop the industry standard.\u201cChinese consumers\u2019 relatively high willingness to try new digital products and mobile services, and the advanced level of China\u2019s mobile payments ecosystem, present a great opportunity for China\u2019s digital giants to dominate in-car connectivity features and operating systems,\u201d it said.These digital services and products targeted at China\u2019s car industry could be worth 1 trillion yuan (US$153 billion) annually, according to a forecast by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which did not say when the milestone would be achieved.\u201cEV is a strategically important industry because it goes beyond carmaking,\u201d said Gao Ting, head of research at Nomura Orient International Securities. \u201cPolicy support to the sector, such as cash subsidy, is expected to have a long-term positive impact [on the economy] as related industries and technologies also develop.\u201dTencent is one of NIO \u2019s early backers, regarded as the bellwether of China\u2019s electric car start-ups. Before NIO\u2019s initial public offering in 2018, the kingmaker in the mainland\u2019s technology sector had invested US$510 million in the company, and followed it up with a raft of additional share purchases. Tencent has successfully backed a slew of tech firms in China, including online food delivery giant MeituanIn June 2019, before NIO\u2019s finances came under strain and put it on the verge of bankruptcy in November, Tencent had invested another US$10 million to show its continued support for the embattled start-up.As of July, Tencent owned a 16.3 per cent stake in NIO, the second-largest shareholder behind founder and chief executive William Li.04:07 China\u2019s automated driving technology speeds ahead with research by search engine giant Baidu China\u2019s automated driving technology speeds ahead with research by search engine giant BaiduNIO\u2019s fortunes have since improved, with sales rebounding in the second half of this year. The surging stock price helped it surpass century-old Ford in terms of valuation last month and secure the No 6 place in the ranking of the world\u2019s most valuable carmakers.Apart from the financial windfall through the paper gains of NIO\u2019s share price, Tencent is hoping that its self-driving system takes off.Tencent is prioritising the development of advanced driver assistant system (ADAS) as it seeks to become a leader in self-driving technologies. ADAS uses automated technologies such as sensors and cameras to detect nearby obstacles or driver errors, and responds promptly to enhance driving safety.Alibaba, the owner of this newspaper, owns the second largest stake in Xpeng . Its connection with the EV start-up dates back to 2014 when it acquired UCWeb, the Chinese mobile internet software and service provider co-founded by He Xiaopeng in 2004.He was named as president of UCWeb and Alibaba Mobile Business Group after the acquisition. The entrepreneur left Alibaba in 2017 and joined Xpeng as chairman of the EV start-up.Alibaba owned 13.3 per cent of Xpeng after its initial public offering in August, when the electric carmaker netted US$1.5 billion from its New York Stock Exchange flotation.Alibaba\u2019s development of the YunOS operating system is likely to help with Xpeng\u2019s progress in making its own self-driving cars in the near future. At present, SAIC\u2019s Roewe RX5 SUV uses YunOS, which includes an intelligent digital map, smart voice control, cameras and internet ID.02:33 Electric cars and Ping Pong: He Xiaopeng, CEO of Chinese electric car start-up Xpeng, on problem solving Electric cars and Ping Pong: He Xiaopeng, CEO of Chinese electric car start-up Xpeng, on problem solvingBaidu is one of the largest shareholders of WM Motor, which is yet to go public. In September, Baidu was among a group of investors that injected 10 billion yuan into the EV start-up in the Series D round of funding.WM is partnering with Baidu on Project Apollo , one of the world\u2019s largest and most diversified open autonomous driving alliance platforms, set up by the Chinese internet search engine in 2017.The tech giants expect to see some returns on their investment and widespread use of their technology eventually before they lose patience with these loss-making EV start-ups, said Ding Haifeng, a consultant with Shanghai-based financial advisory firm Integrity.\u201cIn terms of use of technology in the EVs, those that can race ahead of rivals in making cars smarter will gain an upper hand,\u201d Ding said. \u201cConsequently, interactions with the shareholders in understanding and applying the new technologies will gain greater importance.\u201d",

            "description": "(Nikkei Asia) \u2014 Singapore\u2019s internet services group Sea, Chinese electric-vehicle maker BYD and e-commerce platform Pinduoduo were Asia\u2019s top three gainers in the stock market this year as investors flocked to companies that continued to grow throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.Thanks to worldwide monetary easing and fiscal stimuli that generated money for investment, global stock markets have recovered faster than real economies. Such a development created some high-flying Asian companies that investors hoped would become the next Tencent Holdings or Alibaba Group Holding \u2014 Asia\u2019s two most valuable companies, each now worth around $700 billion.The best example was Sea, known for its Shopee e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia. Its market capitalization grew more than fivefold this year to $102 billion, making it the region\u2019s most valuable listed company. That growth rate is No. 1 among about 500 major Asian companies that had a market cap of over $10 billion at the end of 2019, according to QUICK-FactSet data as of Dec. 22.Sea\u2019s three pillars \u2014 e-commerce, online gaming and e-payment \u2014 all benefited from the pandemic, and it continued aggressive marketing to capture market share. Being a rare Southeast Asian tech startup listed on the New York Stock Exchange, it attracted U.S. investors who see high growth potential in the region.Moreover, Sea won a digital bank license in Singapore earlier this month, which would unlock more fintech opportunities for the company, further boosting its shares.Similarly, Nasdaq-listed Pinduoduo, known for its generous group-buying discounts, is among a handful of Chinese e-commerce companies that benefited from surging demand during the pandemic, with its market cap nearly quadrupling to $170 billion.Online sales for the company remained strong even after the pandemic was largely contained in China. During the July-September quarter, Pinduoduo\u2019s revenue climbed 89% to 14.2 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) from a year earlier, and its net loss narrowed to 784.7 million yuan from 2.34 billion yuan in the same quarter last year.\u201cInformation technology was no doubt the best-performing sector in 2020, and this trend could carry into the next year because consumer behavior has been reshaped by Covid-related travel bans and lockdown measures,\u201d said Margaret Yang, a strategist with DailyFX in Singapore. \u201cThis could have a long-lasting impact on consumer behaviors and preferences.\u201dAsia\u2019s second-biggest gainer, BYD, increased its market capitalization by 333%. The Shenzhen-based automaker, which has had Warren Buffett\u2019s backing since 2008, has significantly improved its deliveries as China recovers strongly from the pandemic. In November, it more than doubled the sales of electric vehicles from a year ago, and now has the largest share in China\u2019s EV market.Investor confidence has also been boosted by a breakthrough in BYD\u2019s battery business. The Blade Battery it had been developing for years was launched in 2020. The battery can increase energy density by at least 30% and reduce costs of raw materials by 30%, according to the company.Other automobile-battery makers also made the list of top winners. China\u2019s Contemporary Amperex Technology had its market cap more than triple to $111 billion, while South Korea\u2019s LG Chem saw its value soar 2.5 times. LG Chem\u2019s market share in EV batteries jumped to 25% this year, from 12% a year ago, as it targeted Europe.Prospects are bright next year for LG Chem because the incoming administration of Joe Biden is expected to focus on the environment, which should raise demand for electric cars in the U.S.Globally, the stock performance of Tesla showed investors\u2019 high expectations of EVs, with its market value rising eightfold to over $600 billion, far exceeding that of Toyota Motor, Japan\u2019s most valuable company.The industrywide rally has also given rise to EV newcomers. The market cap of the Chinese EV startup Nio, which is not among the 500 major Asian companies because its market value was below $10 billion at the end of 2019, increased by 17 times to $74 billion \u2014 higher than General Motors \u2014 as its improved sales and delivery figures helped investor confidence.A few health care-related IT companies also gained significantly this year, with the shares of Hong Kong-listed Alibaba Health Information Technology rising 219% and Japan\u2019s medical information platform M3 soaring 179%.After a plunge in March as the pandemic spread across the world and governments halted economic activities, stock prices have been on an upward trajectory since April after infections peaked in many countries.The Nasdaq composite index climbed 43% this year, while South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei Stock Average rose 24% and 12%. The Shanghai Composite Index also rose, by 10%. The Nikkei Asia300 index, which covers major stocks in Asia outside Japan, gained 17%.However, Southeast Asian markets, which do not hold many high-flying tech listings, generally underperformed, with Thailand\u2019s SET down 10%.Five Asian companies made the list of the world\u2019s 20 most valuable companies: Tencent (No. 7), Alibaba (8), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (12), Samsung Electronics (13) and Chinese liquor maker Kweichow Moutai (17). There were only four Asian companies in the top 20 at the end of 2019. TSMC and Kweichow Moutai are new entrants; Industrial and Commercial Bank of China fell off the list.Some Asian companies rode on the stock market boom to go public this year, making blockbuster initial public offerings. China\u2019s KE Holdings, which listed on the NYSE in August \u2014 the biggest IPO by a Chinese company in the U.S. this year \u2014 is now valued at nearly $80 billion, almost eight times its value when Tencent and SoftBank Group invested in the company last year.The company, also known as Beike Zhaofang, is the mainland\u2019s biggest online real estate transaction platform, earning revenues primarily from commission fees. Investors have been attracted to the company\u2019s business model, as it charges as much as a 3% commission on home sales while keeping overhead costs lower than under those for traditional property agencies. The company\u2019s adjusted net profit more than tripled to 1.86 billion yuan in the quarter ended September.Meanwhile, Asian companies in traditional sectors like energy and transportation lost significant market value this year as their core businesses were hit hard by travel curbs and other pandemic restrictions. The market value of Japanese oil giant INPEX and Chinese state oil major CNOOC fell by 52% and 44% respectively, while that of West Japan Railway declined 47%.Some analysts believe the bull run is not over. \u201cThe upward trajectory remains intact for the global stock market, albeit some technical pullbacks are possible into the first quarter of 2021,\u201d Yang said.She pointed out that stock market valuations appear to be \u201coverstretched\u201d but the accommodative monetary environment and hopes about vaccines may continue to support a bull market in the medium term.She said U.S. President-elect Biden could bring major changes to America\u2019s foreign policy alongside tax reforms. \u201cAside from that, the lingering impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, an uneven rollout of Covid vaccines around the globe and the ongoing U.S.-China spat are among the key event risks.\u201dAdditional reporting by Nikki Sun and Narayanan Somasundaram in Hong Kong and Kim Jaewon in Seoul.This article was originally published by Nikkei AsiaContact editor Yang Ge (geyang@caixin.com)Download our app to receive breaking news alerts and read the news on the go.",

            "description": "Tencent has acquired Leyou Technologies in a $1.5 billion deal, meaning the enormous Chinese corporation now owns even more of the games you know. The deal had been hinted at earlier this year, with Sony also reported to be interested, but was signed-off by Leyou shareholders on December 11 and finalised today.Leyou was a chicken processing company until, in 2014, it began to diversify into videogames by acquiring a majority stake in Canadian developer Digital Extremes, developer of Warframe. Subsequently Leyou went all-in on this strategy, selling off the chicken business in 2016 and acquiring British developer Splash Damage, which most recent has been working on Gears multiplayer and Gears Tactics, and a 20 percent stake in developer Certain Affinity, which in recent times has worked on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered, and Halo Infinite. Finally, Leyou established Athlon games, which is currently working with Amazon on the Lord of the Rings MMO as publishing partner.Leyou's maybe not a household name, but that's some idea of the scale of this acquisition. The full list of Tencent's holdings in games grows ever more comprehensive: as well as outright ownership of developers like Riot Games and Funcom, it owns just under 50 percent of Epic Games, plus stakes in Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft, Paradox Interactive, and many more.\u201cWe\u2019ve always been dedicated to creating team-based games that spark friendships and build passionate communities, and we strive to work with partners who believe in that mission,\" says the Splash Damage co-founder and CEO, the appropriately-named Richard Jolly, \"In our many discussions with Tencent, it became clear that they not only believe in that mission but will do everything they can to enable and empower us to realise it. This is going to be a bold new phase for our studio, with an amazing line-up of ambitious games that deliver on what Splash Damage is all about. We couldn\u2019t be more excited.\"Digital Extremes has always maintained that its deal with Leyou ensured the studio's creative independence, which to be fair does seem to have been the case with Warframe. The studio's blogpost addresses the question of whether Warframe will continue to be developed in this manner:\"Yes, we will continue to create great content for Warframe and we will remain creatively independent. Our focus will remain on listening to you, our community, upgrading Warframe based on your feedback, and developing the kind of great stories, gameplay, and incredible new space ninja action you\u2019ve come to expect from us. Tencent is well known for respecting the creative decisions and integrity of its studios, and for giving them the autonomy and independence to experiment, innovate and thrive.\"Companies like Epic have in the past responded robustly to any suggestion that Tencent is an overbearing or censorious partner, though the Chinese conglomerate's holdings are now so wide and deep that it's attracting attention from the U.S. government. There remains suspicion among western audiences about Tencent's enormous holdings in gaming: after all, in recent weeks we've seen that Western digital storefronts are too scared to sell a Taiwanese horror game for fear of offending China. But its continued growth and reach seem unstoppable.",

            "description": "Are you looking to showcase your brand in front of the brightest minds of the gaming industry? Consider getting a custom GamesBeat sponsorship. Learn more.Tencent picked up a lot of game properties this month when it acquired Leyou Technologies, a Hong Kong-based game company, for $1.5 billion. Among the jewels are Warframe maker Digital Extremes as well as Splash Damage, King Maker, and Radiance.The deal is one more sign of the acquisition frenzy around games during the pandemic, which has helped boost gaming because people can play with friends in a social-distanced way and distract themselves from reality.Digital Extremes, based in London, Ontario, in Canada, was founded in 1993. The company made games like Epic Pinball and The Darkness II. But it found its true calling two decades later with the launch of Warframe, a third-person shooter and role-playing game that has been immensely popular as a free-to-play title. Warframe has more than 60 million registered users across the PC (Steam and the Epic Games Store), PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One, and the Nintendo Switch. A version for Xbox Series X/S is coming in 2021. Warframe is the only game that Digital Extremes is operating right now.I spoke with Digital Extremes chief operating officer Sheldon Carter, who has to manage 345 game developers at the company. Here\u2019s an edited transcript of our interview.Event GamesBeat at the Game Awards We invite you to join us in LA for GamesBeat at the Game Awards event this December 7. Reserve your spot now as space is limited!Learn MoreImage Credit: Digital ExtremesIntroducing Sheldon Carter and Digital ExtremesGamesBeat: Tell me about yourself.Sheldon Carter: I worked at BioWare for a bit on Jade Empire. That was the first game I shipped. I\u2019m from London, Ontario originally.GamesBeat: Where\u2019s Jade Empire 2?Carter: I would have loved to have made that game! [Laughs] It\u2019s like your first child, right? I loved working on that game. We had big plans for Jade 2. I don\u2019t know where they are now. They have lots of other cool ideas in the hopper at BioWare these days. But then I got the opportunity to come back to London and Digital Extremes. I was a producer on Dark Sector. I was creative director on Darkness 2. And a few other projects in between that. Then the whole studio piled into Warframe eight years ago.I\u2019ve been taking over larger and larger chunks. I\u2019ve been COO for a few years now at the company. It\u2019s going great. We\u2019re on the cusp of an update for the global PC build. Games as a service was a totally different transition for our team. We have an update going out in minutes, I think. There\u2019s furious typing all around me on Slack, even though we\u2019re all working from home right now. Things are going great.GamesBeat: In some ways you have a transition from one Chinese company to another Chinese company, but was it interesting operating under Leyou for quite some time?Carter: Leyou had\u2013the best way to put it is they knew we understood our business the best. We understood our market and our customers. They left us alone. I\u2019m not saying we didn\u2019t interact with them. There are some great people there. But our interaction with them was pretty arm\u2019s-length. They were content to let us do what we wanted to do and make Warframe.GamesBeat: Do you reach out to your parent companies, Leyou before or Tencent now, for any insight into the Asian markets, or China in particular?Carter: With Tencent, we just launched on WeGame, their platform. We were doing that independently of this whole acquisition aspect. We\u2019ve worked with them as a partner. WeGame is the biggest platform in China, and that was one we really wanted to be on. It was nice for us, because it was a preview of what it would be like to work with Tencent in a different capacity. They\u2019re our publisher there, and we just launched four days ago. From that perspective, they\u2019re running the version of Warframe that\u2019s in China, and so obviously we work close with them in terms of insights into that market. It\u2019s worked out great.Image Credit: Digital ExtremesSwitching to TencentGamesBeat: Do you expect any changes as you transition to Tencent?Carter: We certainly don\u2019t get the sense that there would be. Similar to Leyou, I think they understand that we understand our business really well. If you look at the studios that Tencent works with in that portfolio, they\u2019re still very much in control of their own destiny. We\u2019re excited about that as well.GamesBeat: It feels like it\u2019s similar to Leyou, except on a larger scale.Carter: Way bigger, for sure.GamesBeat: Leyou seemed to be collecting some well-run studios, but then it stopped at a certain point. It didn\u2019t grow as big as I thought it might. But Tencent already seems to be there. It seems like it could get interesting, to have that many peers or sister companies.Carter: You never know, until these things go through, how it\u2019s all going to work. But the potential there with some of those sister studios and what their knowledge would be, that\u2019s exciting for us.GamesBeat: Do you feel like you may have more opportunities for expansion now?Carter: We\u2019ve had our own forecasting for hiring and how we want to grow. Nothing\u2019s changed. It\u2019s just what we need as DE continues to do more things with Warframe and expanding the game into what we always wanted it to be. To be totally honest, I can\u2019t say nothing has changed either way. But our operational needs, that\u2019s what we base our hiring on.GamesBeat: How many people do you have at the moment?Carter: It\u2019s about 345. If you look at our career page, there\u2019s a laundry list. We have a lot of positions that we\u2019re always looking for. I don\u2019t think anything is going to change there.GamesBeat: And is it still all Warframe all the time? Are there other projects or experiments in the works?Carter: Doug would probably disconnect the call if I revealed anything. But right now, the way we\u2019re oriented, pretty much the entire company is focused on Warframe.Image Credit: Digital ExtremesGamesBeat: I know it wasn\u2019t always that way. Do you feel like you\u2019re gaining something by having such a focus on the one project?Carter: A few years ago we had a game called Amazing Eternals we were working on. That team ended up just all coming onto Warframe. When you have a game with so many content desires and needs, and also\u2013obviously it\u2019s working out for us. It\u2019s a big success. For us as a studio it just makes sense for us to be working on the thing that everyone has been engaged on for so long. Eight years is a long time to work on a project for people, but the game has a lot of different aspects to it. It gives us a lot of opportunities to let people move around and try new things. A lot of times, if we have a new game pitch inside the studio, the question often ends up being, \u201cThat\u2019s a cool idea. How can we put that idea into Warframe?\u201dGamesBeat: Where are most of your people based?Carter: Mostly all in London, Ontario. We have a studio in the states where Doug works, although everyone is at home right now of course. But the vast majority is in London, Ontario, Canada.The state of gamingGamesBeat: How do you view the game industry at large right now, given the position you\u2019re in at Digital Extremes?Carter: Watching the generation change is always fascinating. It gives you some ideas about what studios will come to the forefront, and based on those studios you start seeing the ideas, the trends. We saw Riot announce their MMO plans. That\u2019s interesting. You see a flow in subscription, the way subscription services are growing again, the traditional model of games as a service versus the subscription basis. Cyberpunk shows that there\u2019s still a window for big triple-A. In the generational transition I find that you have to sit and watch for a bit, the first six months, to get a feel for how the landscape is changing. But those are a few things. I\u2019m interested to see subscriptions coming backGamesBeat: It feels like one of Cyberpunk\u2019s problems was trying to do all the platforms at once. Call of Duty: Ghosts did the same when the current generation was beginning, five different platforms falling at the same time, and it seems like it can lead to flying too close to the sun.Carter: When you can pull it off\u2013you saw the success of something like Genshin Impact. They dropped across as many platforms as they could at the same time. You get that groundswell. Our approach has been a bit different. We add platforms as we go. That\u2019s also probably a part of our strategy, our DNA. PC, then PS4 and Xbox, then Switch. Now we have the PS5 version. The Series X version is coming soon. If all those things hit\u2013you\u2019re right, you\u2019re flying pretty close to the sun, but I can understand why people try it.GamesBeat: Have you thought about what Riot is doing now, the notion of going to platforms like Snapchat and instant games and mobile? There are different ways a brand can move around these days.Carter: We look at all of that. Right now our next big focus is going to be the Series X version of Warframe. We\u2019re still pretty focused on our main markets. But the size of our team leaves us potential to do a lot of things.Image Credit: Digital ExtremesGamesBeat: The transaction here is an example of the international nature of the industry. Do you think the industry is going to keep moving in that direction, becoming more borderless? Could that affect you in the future?Carter: One of the most exciting aspects for us with launching on WeGame in China was that the Tencent crew was committed to updating the game closer to global. With our previous publisher, that was a fine relationship, but it was tougher to move the game at the same pace as global. Our happiest version of Warframe is one where all our territories and regions are playing the same version and can have a shared community, versus fractured communities based on region. That trend is going to continue. We want to do that as much as we can. But obviously, there are governmental restrictions in certain countries that prevent that.GamesBeat: Is cross-platform still a priority these days, being as cross-platform as you can make it?Carter: We do live streams with our community once a week, and big ones every two weeks. All the time the question is, \u201cWhen will I be able to cross-progress on every platform and cross-play with everyone?\u201d Right now you can do that with PS4 and PS5, and inside all the PC communities, but of course, what players want is to be able to play on any device that they choose. Games become a hobby. That\u2019s what Warframe is for a lot of our players. It\u2019s a hobby, and they want to participate in that hobby on every device. They don\u2019t want to have to wait until they get home.When you switch between console generations, it\u2019s interesting. Someone who\u2019s been a long time PC player might finally get a PS5 or whatever. They want to try it in a different way.Warframe\u2019s growthGamesBeat: How big is Warframe as far as the numbers now? What\u2019s the biggest platform?Carter: Console in total probably slightly\u2013it\u2019s very close between PC and all the consoles together. But in terms of numbers, at TennoCon this year, we had our biggest single day of Warframe in terms of active players coming to play and watch the game. Eight years in, we\u2019re pretty excited about that.GamesBeat: Have you seen a big pandemic effect on the game?Carter: I don\u2019t want to say it \u201chelped,\u201d because we don\u2019t feel that way. We all feel the effects of the pandemic. But there\u2019s definitely\u2013people are at home more, and they\u2019re able to play. Again, if this is your hobby, you have more time for your hobby. It\u2019s funny. We have a tough time separating\u2013when we look at this year, we all had to switch to working from home. So what\u2019s this going to do to the type of updates and content we release? At the same time, so many of our players are at home and engaging more. It was a wash of a year to figure out, \u201cHey, did we do the right things this year? How do we move into 2021 and take some lessons from this year?\u201d Hopefully as the vaccines roll out and people go back to normal, what\u2019s that going to look like? It\u2019s hard to say.GamesBeat: What keeps you going on things like the marketing side? How are you finding new users?Carter: The platform expansion always brings in fresh blood. As soon as you have a new console generation, all these new players come in. We also just went to Epic Games Store. You make some assumptions. You think people who are PC players are maybe on both. They\u2019re already on Steam and they have Epic as a secondary. But you\u2019re not sure. The amount of new players we\u2019ve had from launching on Epic is actually surprising and really cool for us. New players are obviously the life blood of any game. We had quite a few different ones over the past\u2013God, it\u2019s only been a month. But over the past month there\u2019s been a lot of different avenues for the game to grow.When we launched on Switch in 2018, November 2018, within a month we had a million registered users on the platform. Each time we hit a new platform it\u2019s always surprising for us to see, that many people downloading Warframe for the first time. They might have heard of it, or played it on PC a long time ago. But when we hit these new platforms, a lot of new players are activated for the first time. Or maybe it\u2019s the third time they\u2019ve played Warframe, but they\u2019re playing it again.Image Credit: Digital ExtremesGamesBeat: How have influencers and streamers made a difference when it comes to making people more aware of the game?Carter: We find that we\u2013there is some component of them that works for our game. But it ends up usually being more about those hardcore fans that become partners. We have more success with them. Our game is a PvE game. It\u2019s not something where they have to be the thing that drives it. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s the case for all PvP games either, but in our scenario, it becomes a part of our co-dev that we have with our audience. Streamers are just one aspect that becomes an input channel for us.GamesBeat: Are localization and culturalization big tasks for you? Does it require a lot of manpower?Carter: We\u2019ve specialized our support teams. You end up having a community group for the language, a support group for that language, and then those people start turning into translators as well, because we\u2019re localizing. We have a few people on the localization team that just work on the outsourcing aspect, but then a lot of it is inside. We have some talented folks for every language. They work out of London, so we\u2019re getting a personalized touch on localization.GamesBeat: You have the update that\u2019s ongoing right now. What\u2019s your schedule like for the near future? What\u2019s coming in the next year?Carter: In the last stream we had on Wednesday, we promised that we\u2019d make fewer promises. We have a whole pipe of things that we\u2019ve let people know are coming. Now, the order of that, hopefully they\u2019ll still be surprised and excited by what\u2019s happening. But we\u2019re not making any new promises now. We\u2019re going to finish delivering the ones we\u2019ve made so far.The context of this\u2013at TennoCon the summer before last, we did a very ambitious delivery of all this great stuff, all these space battle ideas and connecting in all these different ways. It was very ambitious, and we realized it was going to be pretty tough. We had to split it all into parts. We want to make sure all that content comes out and we restrain ourselves from getting too excited and promising too much, so everyone has the right expectations. We\u2019re trying hard to set expectations for our players so that they know things are going to come out in phases. That\u2019s part of the beauty of live service games.GamesBeat: At the level you\u2019re at, do you want to become a kind of cultural phenomenon? Is that in the set of goals somewhere?Carter: Maybe it\u2019s because we\u2019re Canadian, but we don\u2019t set goals like that. Obviously we want people to know and love the game. With Warframe, we always feel like we\u2019re the biggest game that maybe not all of your friends have heard of yet. There\u2019s still room for us to catch a lot of other people.GamesBeat: Circling back to opportunities with Tencent, what do you think about there?Carter: I\u2019m probably missing something when I think about this, but the biggest opportunity I see is the potential for collaborating and hearing more ideas from our sister studios. But also just the ability to keep doing what we\u2019re doing. We have our own road map. We know what we want to do. We\u2019re just excited that we can keep doing that. Potentially, if there are new ideas we can find because there\u2019s a collaboration between those studios, that would be amazing.",

            "description": "French media conglomerate Vivendi said on Friday that a consortium led by China\u2019s Tencent will exercise its option to acquire a further 10% stake in Universal Music Group, raising the consortium\u2019s holding to 20%.A Tencent-led consortium completed its deal to buy 10% of UMG in March this year. It retained an option running until January 2021 to double its stake, through a second purchase on the same valuation. The Tencent deals put a floor valuation of EUR30 billion ($36.9 billion) on UMG.In a press statement the French company said: \u201cVivendi has enjoyed the presence of Tencent and its co-investors at UMG\u2019s share capital since March and is very happy the Consortium has decided to exercise its option. They will enable UMG to further develop its activities in Asia.\u201dVivendi says it plans to sell other minority stakes in UMG and to pursue an IPO of the unit by 2022 at the latest. \u201cThe cash generated by these transactions may be used by Vivendi to reduce its financial debt and to finance share buybacks and acquisitions,\u201d it added.In a subsequent regulatory filing, Tencent also confirmed the move.\u201cThe consortium comprises the same members as that for the initial 10% investment in UMG, including Tencent Music Entertainment Group and other financial co-investors,\u201d Tencent said. \u201cThe transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2021.\u201dThe March deal was complemented by a separate agreement, allowing Tencent Music to acquire a minority stake in the UMG subsidiary owning its Greater China operations.Regulatory approval for the latest deal would normally be a formality given that it represents a stake increase, not a new acquisition, and that regulators would have been aware of the option at the time they green-lighted the March deal.However, the activities of tech companies have this year become part of the Cold War narrative between the U.S. under President Donald Trump and hardline Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The U.S. has sought to rein in Chinese hardware suppliers Huawei and GTE and service companies including Bytedance\u2019s TikTok and Tencent\u2019s WeChat.Moreover, in recent months competition and technology regulators across the planet have taken a much harder line on global tech giants. In China, the government has recently begun to use its State Administration of Market Regulation to limit the power and influence of its own internet giants for the first time. In the past few years, China has also used foreign currency controls to rein in large overseas purchases by Chinese firms.And only last week, the same State Administration of Market Regulation fined a trio of Chinese companies, including a different Tencent offshoot, for not seeking its prior permission before deal-making.That pressure, however, is also counterbalanced by Beijing\u2019s desire to see Chinese companies wield cultural and media influence around the globe in similar fashion to U.S. media conglomerates.Tencent, which already owns significant stakes in many of the world\u2019s leading games companies, has 9.1% of music streaming leader Spotify, and boasts over a billion users for its WeChat super app, is well positioned to take on that mantle as China\u2019s international tech champion.",

            "description": "The Tencent Video Star Awards happened in Nanjing, China earlier this week. If you\u2019ve never heard of Tencent and you care about pop culture, you should start getting familiar. Tencent is a major multimedia Chinese conglomerate. It is the world\u2019s biggest gaming company and has a stake in some of the most well-known video games in the gaming space, including Fortnite, League of Legends, and Call of Duty.In addition to gaming though, Tencent has been investing heavily in Hollywood. The company has a deal with Disney for Star Wars marketing in China and a deal with the NBA to stream and license the league\u2019s content in China. Tencent runs WeChat, \u201cApple\u2019s biggest threat in China\u201d. Back in 2017, Wired called Tencent the \u201cnext Disney\u201d, soon to be a global entertainment juggernaut.Obviously Tencent produces a lot of Chinese language content. But some of the English-language films you\u2019ve seen or will see are Tencent co-productions. Like Tom Hanks in A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood. And the upcoming Top Gun: Maverick.The point then, at least for this post, is that if Tencent is having an event, major entertainers in China are going to show up, including Dilireba, the actor considered by many to be one of if not the most beautiful women in East Asia. Over the last few years, Dilireba, born Dilraba Dilmurat, is one of the most popular celebrities in China, with multiple brand partnerships and starring some of the most watched Chinese drama series in the country. Earlier this year, she was the female lead in Eternal Love of Dream which generated a BILLION VIEWS in just one week. As you can see, Dilireba dressed to her status for the red carpet at the event. That is a LOT of dress. And a crown.I like Dilireba and while I\u2019ve dipped into a couple of her dramas this year (the other being Love Advanced Customisation), the reason I spend more time on Korean and Taiwanese series over Chinese dramas is because\u2026Chinese dramas are TOO F-CKING LONG. My people do not know how to edit. Some series are over 50 episodes. Rom-coms are regularly 40 or more episodes. This is not necessary! I love the drawn-out angst and make up and break up formula as much as anyone else but nobody needs it to be more than 20 episodes, tops. And even that is a stretch. I\u2019m OK when it\u2019s a historical and/or period piece drama (there\u2019s a Chinese Game of Thrones like every six months, seriously) but the other sh-t is way too much.Also attached to this post, Victoria Song, also a popular actor in China. She\u2019s the star of Find Yourself, a C-drama I mentioned I was obsessed with back in February. Find Yourself is about a business executive who falls in love with one of the company\u2019s interns. The series is cute and the chemistry between the two leads is hot\u2026but again, that sh-t was 41 episodes! Totally unnecessary.Anyway, Victoria went with white bustier dress with black trim at the Tencent Awards but can I just show you what she wore to another event back in October because this is how extra a Chinese red carpet can get.Victoria Song attends opening ceremony of China Golden Eagle TV Art Festival on October 16, 2020 in Changsha, Hunan Province of ChinaWeirdly, though, as extra as they bring it with the tiaras and the ballgowns, the hair on Chinese red carpets is often NOT extra enough.",

            "description": "(Bloomberg) -- China\u2019s antitrust watchdog fined Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and a Tencent Holdings Ltd. unit over a pair of years-old acquisitions and said it\u2019s reviewing an impending Tencent-led merger, signaling Beijing\u2019s intention to tighten oversight of internet sector deals.The State Administration for Market Regulation said Monday it\u2019s reviewing the combination of DouYu International Holdings Ltd. with Huya Inc., which could create a Chinese game streaming leader akin to Amazon\u2019s Twitch. It fined Alibaba 500,000 yuan ($76,500) for failing to seek approval before increasing its stake in department store chain Intime Retail Group Co. to 73.79% in 2017, while China Literature Ltd., the e-books business spun off by Tencent, was also censured over a previous deal, according to a statement.The penalties come after regulators last month declared their intention to increase scrutiny of China\u2019s largest tech corporations with new anti-monopoly rules. Beijing in November unveiled draft regulations that establish a framework for curbing anti-competitive behavior such as colluding on sharing sensitive consumer data, alliances that squeeze out smaller rivals and subsidizing services at below cost to eliminate competitors.

Their failure to actively declare has a relatively severe impact.\u201dBeijing\u2019s heightened scrutiny is spurring fears of a broader crackdown on the country\u2019s largest firms. On Monday, shares in No. 3 internet company Meituan plunged 3.8% after the People\u2019s Daily wrote an editorial slamming the industry\u2019s preoccupation with growing traffic and volumes in areas such as grocery delivery, at the expense of real scientific innovation.Story continuesChina\u2019s two largest corporations are also its most acquisitive, using scores of deals to expand into adjacent fields and groom some of the country\u2019s most promising startups.Alibaba had led a $2.6 billion buyout of Intime as part of efforts to develop new business models that combine e-commerce with brick-and-mortar retailing. China Literature agreed in 2018 to buy New Classics Media for as much as 15.5 billion yuan to expand in filmed content.The companies had failed to seek approval for the deals, which aren\u2019t deemed anti-competitive, the antitrust regulator said Monday. China Literature said in a statement that it has been actively working with regulators on compliance, while Alibaba representatives didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.Read more: Jack Ma Bets $2.6 Billion He Can Revamp China Retail SectorWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says:Alibaba\u2019s ability to strengthen its domestic e-commerce ecosystem through M&A may be significantly weakened on rising anti-monopoly scrutiny, underlined by a 500,000 yuan fine by the State Administration for Market Regulation on Monday for failing to seek approval for its stake acquisitions of Intime Retail in 2014-18. While the amount is immaterial to Alibaba, retroactive application of new anti-competitive rules announced in November may be a stern warning to toe the line in future.-- Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analystsClick here to read the researchHuya in October agreed to buy DouYu in an all-share deal and Tencent, which currently owns stakes in both companies, was expected to hold about 68% of the merged business\u2019s voting shares.

The firm\u2019s industrial projects range from using AI to screen medical images to building customer management tools for retailers on its WeChat messenger.Most recently, Tencent invested in FJ Dynamics, a Chinese startup selling agricultural automation solutions such as smart tractors and rice transplanters as well as unmanned vehicles for ports and factories to clients around the world.

MTM and PG.biz have partnered on a weekly column to not only bring you industry moving news, but also short analyses on each. To check out this week\u2019s entire meta, visit www.masterthemeta.com!Tencent turned 2020 into a record investment year with 29 gaming-related deals (so far!). 20 of these deals are China-based companies and nine are international studios. Contrary to public perception, this amount of activity is actually new for Tencent. Since 2005, Tencent has on average invested in less than 10 gaming-related companies annually. Before we get into the analysis regarding such a strategy shift, here\u2019s the investment breakdown for the year:Tencent\u2019s international PC/Console strategy is fairly straightforward - take an existing PC IP with global appeal, broaden the company\u2019s insights, and often turn it into a mobile game for broad distribution. This is a proven route for Tencent following the playbook of PUBG, League of Legends, and Counter-Strike. We could likely see DayZ Mobile, The Cycle Mobile, and more in the coming years. (We wrote much more about Tencent\u2019s mobile strategy here)Interestingly, Tencent\u2019s accelerating investment activity primarily revolves around increasing the number of early-stage deals. In the past, most of Tencent\u2019s deals were executed very methodically and focused on industry leaders (like Supercell, Riot Games, and Epic Games). However, 2020\u2019s deals are more focused on early-stage companies, plus niche genres, and were seemingly executed with greater speed. What changed?One explanation floating around Chinese media points to Genshin Impact. Genshin Impact by Mihoyo not only burst onto the scene and immediately became a global top grossing game, but Mihoyo also completely circumvented Tencent\u2019s ecosystem in China. 90 per cent of ad spend went to Bilibili and Bytedance\u2019s platforms, and players can\u2019t even download the game on Tencent\u2019s Myapp store.The meteoric rise of smaller, non-Tencent backed studios focusing on niche genres such as Mihoyo (Genshin Impact), Hypergryph (Arknights), and Papergames (Mr Love: Queen\u2019s Choice) reveals that Tencent underestimated part of how the industry would evolve. Papergames (established less than 7 years) and Hypergryph (established less than 2 years) already command a net profit of RMB 1 billion each, with valuations of tens of billions RMB. Mihoyo\u2019s valuation is now estimated to be more than RMB30 billion ($4.6 billion).Of course, Tencent is doing just fine, and its gaming business still made meaningful progress this year despite being slower to certain trends. It can\u2019t control everything, after all. That said, Tencent now recognizes a new paradigm shift where player growth could come from anywhere, and the company is quickly adapting to ensure future growth from new sources decreasingly passes them by.

            "description": "Yesterday we reported that Devotion, a cult horror title from Taiwanese developer Red Candle Games, would be re-released on GOG after being unavailable for nearly two years. A few hours after this announcement was made GOG, owned by CD Projekt, unceremoniously dumped the game via the below tweet.Earlier today, it was announced that the game Devotion is coming to GOG. After receiving many messages from gamers, we have decided not to list the game in our store.December 16, 2020 See moreThis has gone down in the west like a cup of cold sick, with the above tweet receiving a rather brutal shoeing and at least one developer pulling their game from GOG in protest. While the \"many messages from gamers\" seems a ridiculous phrase, and there's little evidence of any adverse reaction on western-centric media, the original controversy over the game was largely fuelled by users on the Chinese social platform Weibo. The hashtag relating to the game (#\u8fd8\u613f#) has huge historical engagement figures, and the point I'm making is that, just because the \"many messages\" aren't immediately visible to us doesn't mean they don't exist: some conspiracists seem to think the Chinese Communist Party is involved but, as the Monster Hunter movie recently showed, there is a large and vociferous Chinese audience ready to jump on anything percieved as anti-China without prompting.PCG has contacted GOG to ask for further details on the decision not to list Devotion, and will update with any response. The game's developer, Red Candle Games, has now responded to this latest setback.pic.twitter.com/SKI3SeW18sDecember 17, 2020 See more\"Though regretful but we are willing to understand and respect GOG's decision,\" reads the statement. \"For the players looking forward to Devotion's re-release, please accept our most sincere apology. This is a difficult predicament to overcome, but we won't stop striving.\"Full marks to Red Candle Games for its restraint, though the way ahead now is unclear. Itch.io may be one route. Some have suggested the Epic Games Store, but given that Epic itself is just under half-owned by the Chinese media giant Tencent that seems unlikely.It's worth ending on an important point here: the joke that caused such offense is no longer in the game, and hasn't been for years. The pursuit of Devotion and its developers in this way is no longer about the game's content: it's just about stopping it being sold anywhere because it once had something in that the Chinese audience didn't like. It's almost unbearably petty. Red Candle's excellent Detention remains available on Steam, should you wish to support a developer that could use it.",

            "description": "Curve Digital has named Tencent and Sega veteran John Clark as its CEO.The new hire follows a string of big signings for the Human: Fall Flat publisher, which includes the acquisitions of indie studios Runner Duck and IronOak Games this year. Curve MD Jason Perkins has moved over to the newly created role of chief of studios, and is tasked with leading the new developers alongside future teams, with as many as six new acquisitions targeted over the next three years.Clark is a well-regarded leader in the UK games industry and has held senior roles at Eidos, Sega and Tencent. He was EVP of publishing at Sega, where he worked for almost 13 years, and was part of the team that drove Sega's PC digital business. His most recent role was VP of partnerships in Europe for Tencent.Curve was acquired last year by NorthEdge Capital in a deal worth \u00a390 million. In an interview with GamesIndustry.biz, Clark says the firm is looking to become a major British publishing business, and the chance to be a part of that was too good to miss.\"In the UK industry, it's hard not to recognise the impact of Team17, Sumo, Frontier, Codemasters, Keywords,\" Clark begins. \"We see the success of these companies and the way they're building a significant UK industry. Curve is part of that -- it's in a different part of the cycle, but still an exciting part.\"It feels like these opportunities come along once in a lifetime\"\"If you then think about the indie games industry, again, that is flourishing. When we think about where the innovation is and where the next big thing is going to come from, it's difficult to not think about the thriving indie community. So to be part of both the UK games industry and the indie games scene, that was a big, big draw for me.\"He continues: \"Then if we look at Curve, they have established themselves. They've got a strong investor in NorthEdge, Dominic [Wheatley, CEO of parent company Catalis] and Stuart (Dinsey, Curve Chairman) have structured an organisation that has demonstrated growth over the last two years. It is profitable and it is well capitalised.\"What's also important is it's not just about third-party publishing, It's also about a first-party games business with the acquisitions of Runner Duck, which developed the Crew franchise [Space Crew and Bomber Crew], and more recently IronOak [For The King]. For me, it's really important that Curve is now making those steps into studio and IP ownership.\"The final part on that is the people. It is always important. We are at this pivot point where you've got first-party studios, you've got a strong third-party portfolio, you've now got a team of people who are indie and are the lifeblood of Curve, and you've got people who have come in with different skill-sets. To bring all of that together and take that forward, it feels like these opportunities come along once in a lifetime.\"Curve CEO John Clark (above) with Catalis CEO Dominic Wheatley (above)Clark says his job is to deliver significant growth for Curve and NorthEdge, and highlights the work Debbie Bestwick has achieved at fellow British publisher Team17.\"If we can do anything near to what Debbie's doing, that would be incredible,\" he says. \"We want to be world class. With Eidos, we remember what it was like to have a significant UK games business, and it feels like we are heading in that direction.\"Many of the fellow British firms that Clark references -- including Team17, Frontier and Sumo, which was also backed by NorthEdge -- are all publicly-owned companies. So is becoming a listed business part of the objective?\"With every investor, what do they want out of it? Do they want a return? Or do they want a longer-term interest? I guess it's a bit of both. NorthEdge exited Sumo, and Perwyn took over, and Perwyn are still there at Sumo. So is IPO an option for us? Yeah, of course it is. We see the success not only on the UK stock market, but also with other stock markets with games companies. So that has to be an option.\"Is selling an option for us? Of course. At some point... when will we be ready? When will we have the infrastructure finely tuned to be able to take in extra capital to be able to drive the business to having a big step change? The indie game sector is always something we will want to be interested in, but how do we start to scale up to become triple-I, and then AA, and then AAA? You will need capital to do that, and a way to do that is either through our existing investors, through a market raise, or through a sale process.\"\"Is IPO an option for us? Yeah, of course it is\"Clark references AAA, but he's keen to stress that the firm is very much indie-focused in terms of uncovering those potential big new franchises.\"The indie community is a breeding ground for breakouts,\" he says. \"It is where innovation comes, it is where risk is taken, and it's where new ideas are hatched. Always making sure that you can focus on that level should remain a USP of companies like Curve. Other companies who are already operating in the AAA and AA space, they find it more of a challenge to look at that grass-roots level innovation and incubation space. It becomes a challenge for a few reasons, because of business dependencies, because of skillset, because of capacity, because of empathy.\"How can you speak to AAA and indie at the same time? It's obviously a real skill to be able to nurture that and have empathy for those developers. Without answering your question specifically, it's about how do you really stay close to where the innovation is. Because you've done interviews yourself with those who have delivered incredible breakout hits, and who can call them?\"Clark says a key focus for Curve will be to demonstrate this empathy for the studios it works with and acquires.\"It's about trying to understand the vision of the developer,\" Clark says. \"On my adventures of talking to many, many different businesses, that's not always there. How does the developer want to take their game forward? And their community? Their success? It is so important for any games publisher to really try and understand that, and then trying to understand how the publisher fits in. It's all about how together we can make the game bigger than we could independently.\"Back when I was at Sega, we had six studios, and working with one was not the same as working with the other. If we look at independent studios like Two Point Studios, from start to completion of that project [Two Point Hospital], I was really proud to be involved in that and it was all about the vision of the developer. We need to know that one size doesn't fit all. When someone walks in and says 'Hi, I'm the AAA person', that's not always a positive. It's about how you apply that.\"Space Crew is Curve's debut first-party releaseChief of studios Jason Perkins will be key to that when it comes to establishing and expanding the firm's first-party teams. Perkins founded Curve as a development business, and it's something he's excited to return to now he can step away from overall management of the company.\"In the first couple of years we were doing a couple of million, and now we're doing tens of millions,\" Perkins says. \"Our development spends are now in their millions. We now have over 40 people. That requires a lot of reporting and HR work, and I came to the conclusion -- and it was hard to get there -- that I was not the right person to take the business further. There are ambitions to grow the business to hundreds of millions, which is all very achievable. I was doing a lot of strategy and finance stuff, and I just found that bit really dull.\"\"When you think about content, geographies, platforms and viable ways of delivering content... There's never been a time like it\"He continues: \"We opportunistically acquired Runner Duck. They were a two-person studio, and they've since released Space Crew and are now a five-person studio. We're not talking AAA studios, but even the growing pains of going from two to five creates issues, and I have a lot of experience in growing studios.\"We also acquired IronOak. They're a five-person studio and for their next project they want to get to 12. And with Dominic's plan to build out more studios -- he is looking to acquire six studios over the next two to three years -- I can work really closely with these studios on their issues and be their voice within the Curve group.\"Longer term, Perkins will also be tasked with building out development resources for both internal and external studios. Although the company has ambitions to rapidly expand its development teams, Clark says it has to be the right developers with the right vision.\"There are studios that want to develop different games all the time, and there are studios that want to deliver and build ongoing franchises and experiences that will continue to thrive,\" he says. \"That last one is something that is really interesting to me. IronOak and Runner Duck have a longer term view, which means we can build a longer term relationship. For me it's looking at that. Even when I was at Sega, it was about building a long-term, meaningful partnership together. It's not about coming in, making a bit of money and moving on.\"It's been an active few years months for Curve, and the aim for Clark is to maintain the growth and follow in the footsteps of other recent British success stories.\"What an exciting time to be in the industry,\" he concludes. \"There has always been new platforms and new ways of delivering games... but never have we been in a situation where you're adding more viable platforms to the incumbents through Google, Amazon and Epic, as well as more ways of playing, more ways of delivering content. The console platforms are not only bringing out new devices, but new ways of purchasing content. You have this multi-dimensional expanse of the business, which we've all been talking about for a long time, but right now, this Christmas, it's happening. It's all out there, it's all to play with and to build businesses and expertise on.\"When you think about content, when you think about geographies, when you think about platforms and viable ways of delivering content to consumers, it's phenomenal. There's never been a time like it.\"",

            "description": "While iQiyi, Tencent Video and Youku are all privately owned, Mango is part of Hunan Broadcasting System, the main state-owned broadcaster for Central China\u2019s Hunan province.E-commerce giant Alibaba will buy 5.26% of TV services provider Mango Excellent Media Co. Ltd. for 6.2 billion yuan ($947 million), the latter announced, potentially bringing together two of the nation\u2019s top online video providers as they bleed money in their battle for market share.The deal would mark the first major investment by a private internet company in one of China\u2019s foremost state-owned online broadcasters. Alibaba counts the Youku online video service among its major assets, while Mango Excellent Media owns the similarly popular Mango TV.Under their new equity tie-up, Mango will issue 93.6 million new shares to Alibaba at a price of 66.23 yuan apiece, representing the average price over the last 30 trading days before the announcement, according to an announcement from Mango dated on Friday. The deal would make Alibaba Mango\u2019s second largest stakeholder, behind only its parent, Mango Media, which would hold a majority 59%.Mango first announced its fundraising plan in September, saying it could raise as much as 4.5 billion yuan by selling 5.26% of the company to as many as 35 investors. At the time it said it would use the lion\u2019s share of the proceeds on programming-related initiatives, including self-productions as well as acquisitions, reflecting the importance of such premium programming in the industry.But after approaching numerous potential investors, the company decided to settle on a single one, Alibaba, which also has rich resources in the broadcasting and entertainment sectors. In addition to Youku, Alibaba also owns Alibaba Pictures, a filmed entertainment production entity, as well as a couple of online ticketing platforms. It also has major investments in filmed production companies Huayi Bros. and Enlight Media, as well as online video service Bilibili.Alibaba\u2019s Youku and Mango\u2019s Mango TV are roughly comparable in size, with average daily viewers in the less-than-50 million range, according to market research firm QuestMobile. By comparison, the two biggest players, Tencent Video and iQiyi, the latter controlled by online search leader Baidu, are each about twice that size.Mango TV is earning a profit, but the other big three are all believed to be losing money as they spend heavily on creating and acquiring exclusive content. In this year\u2019s third quarter, iQiyi, the only publicly traded company among the three big private players, recorded a net loss of 1.2 billion yuan, a big improvement on its 3.7 billion yuan loss a year earlier.Amid such stiff competition, talk has periodically circulated that one or more companies might be looking to combine their assets in a move of consolidation.Last year rumors emerged that Alibaba might sell Youku, even though the company denied such talk. Similar rumors emerged in the second half of this year that Baidu was looking to sell its controlling stake in iQiyi, with Tencent, ByteDance and Alibaba all mentioned as potential suitors. Reuters reported last week that Baidu had indeed conducted such talks with Tencent and Alibaba, but that the two suitors had ultimately backed off due to Baidu\u2019s high price demands.While iQiyi, Tencent Video and Youku are all privately owned, Mango is part of Hunan Broadcasting System, the main state-owned broadcaster for Central China\u2019s Hunan province, and is often considered one of the most successful of China\u2019s many state-owned broadcasters.Contact reporter Yang Ge (geyang@caixin.com)Download our app to receive breaking news alerts and read the news on the go.",

Its latest quarterly earnings showed drops in revenue and subscribers, punishing its shares which have lost nearly a fifth of their value in the last two weeks.It is also being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after a report in April issued by short-seller Wolfpack Research accused iQIYI of inflating numbers. iQIYI, which is cooperating with the probe, has said an internal review has found no proof of Wolfpack's claims.The video streaming service, whose cash and cash equivalents almost halved in the nine months to end-September to 3.16 billion yuan ($481 million) plans to raise at least $1 billion in the coming months, said one person with direct knowledge of the matter.That may take the form of a share offering or a convertible bond or both, the person said, adding, however, that the company's recent share slide has clouded its financing prospects.iQIYI did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its fundraising plans. Baidu said in a statement that iQIYI, as an independent publicly listed entity, has smooth financing channels in capital markets and its support of iQIYI has not changed.REGULATORY HEADWINDSInvesting in iQIYI now may be politically difficult for Alibaba and Tencent after Beijing this month unveiled draft guidelines aimed at preventing monopolistic behaviour by internet companies. The draft's scope ranges from big data to payment services.That came on the heels of the shock move by regulators to slam the brakes on Alibaba affiliate Ant Group's $37 billion IPO just days ahead of its debut in a stunning rebuke for Ant and Alibaba founder Jack Ma.\"After regulators published new fintech and anti-trust rules which will hit Alibaba's business, Alibaba's management is currently reluctant to proceed with big deals,\" one person said.Purchasing iQIYI would give ByteDance, which makes most of its profits from short video app Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, the opportunity to enter the main market for longer length TV shows and movies.It does have a separate video platform Xigua, which mainly offers videos of 1-30 minutes, an area it has been planning to step up investment in.But Baidu, which holds more than 90% of iQIYI's shareholder voting rights, is not likely to consider ByteDance as a buyer given a years-long feud between the two companies in China's digital ad market, said two sources.The search engine giant's interest in selling its stake in iQIYI comes on the back of a shift in focus to developing artificial intelligence and autonomous driving - areas which require heavy upfront investment.Tencent Video was ranked the top player in China's video streaming market with a penetration rate of 45% at the end of 2019, followed by iQIYI with 43% and Alibaba's Youku with 27%, according to research firm BlueCatData.Reporting by Julie Zhu in Hong Kong, Yingzhi Yang, Zhang Yan and Yilei Sun in Beijing; Editing by Edwina GibbsOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

YonhapBy Lee Min-hyungSamsung Fire & Marine Insurance is expanding its footholds in China and Europe to find new revenue sources overseas amid growing saturation in the local insurance industry.The latest in a series of Samsung Fire's overseas partnerships came last week when the company signed a contract to establish a joint venture in China under partnership with Tencent, the country's largest internet and tech firm.Korea's top non-life insurer opted to turn its Chinese branch into the joint venture with a view to strengthening the insurer's online sales there. The strategy of signing a partnership with local players is generally deemed more stable than other expansion tactics in terms of potential legal risks, particularly when the other country is China.The Samsung affiliate will own a 37 percent stake in the joint entity, with Tencent becoming the second-largest shareholder with a 32 percent stake. Other Chinese tech and financial firms will also invest in the joint venture and their combined stake will reach 31 percent.The joint venture will start its business there with a total capital of around 500 billion won. Samsung Fire plans to take advantage of Tencent's online platforms as the biggest sales channel. Tencent operates China's top mobile messenger app WeChat, which has over 1.1 billion monthly users.Under the partnership, the Samsung affiliate's Chinese branch will transform into the joint venture co-managed by the two companies following Tencent's investment.Samsung Fire tapped into the Chinese market by establishing its Beijing branch in 1995, and then opened a Shanghai office in 2001. Samsung Fire's Chinese branch reported a net profit of 12.4 billion won in 2019. This is a steep growth, compared with 1.8 billion won in 2016 there.The partnership will enable Samsung Fire to strengthen its mobile and online footholds in Asia's largest insurance market. The joint venture is expected to focus its business on launching a series of online insurance products. Samsung Fire has expressed its repeated interest in establishing its own digital non-life insurer in Korea.The company joined hands with Kakao, the top mobile messenger app operator in Korea, for the establishment of a digital non-life insurer here. But they failed to narrow their differences during key decision-making processes regarding the launch of online car insurance products, and the much-hyped plan came to nothing in the end.Given Tencent's massive influence in the Chinese market, expectations remain high that Samsung Fire will be able to achieve tangible outcomes this time.\"China is the world's second-largest non-life insurance market whose growth potential remains high,\" an insurance industry source said. \"Samsung Fire's partnership with one of the most influential Chinese tech firms raises hopes for its faster and more stable growth there.\"The non-life insurance affiliate of Samsung Group is also expanding investment in the European market. In October, the company made an additional investment of $10 million by taking part in a capital increase of Canopius, a specialty insurer based in the United Kingdom.Last year, Samsung Fire invested $150 million in Canopius and participates in management as a board member.",

The robot can walk, run and jump as well as this trick with plum blossom piles - which are used by those learning Kung Fu to teach better balanceJamoca must be able to understand the arrangement (position and height) of the cylinder piles, choose the best footing position, while walking steadily and accuratelyBut to make it even more difficult, the cylinders were at different heights meaning Jamoca had to have its four legs adjusted at various angles to keep its balance.'Under this combined challenge, Jamoca must understand the arrangement (position and height) of the plum blossom piles, choose the best footing point and route, and walk steadily and accurately,' said Jiqizhixin.Jamoca estimates the position and posture of the cylinders and the steps it must take in real time, with a positioning error of less than 0.3 of an inch.It then conducts a 10 millisecond-level online planning based on the surrounding environment to ensure the safest, fastest and most labour-saving route.Tencent's Robotics X laboratory is particular focused on autonomous characteristics of robots such as consciousness and judgement, according to Jiqizhixin.'The purpose is to realise autonomous judgements, autonomous decision-making and complete tasks of robots in a dynamic environment with great uncertainty,' the site reports.The robot dog uses a front-facing camera and visual modelling to accurately perceive its environment and achieve robust eye and foot calibrationScreenshot from the video, showing the cylinders at different heights to make it more difficult for Jamoca to navigateTencent's Robotics X laboratory 'pays more attention to the study of autonomous characteristics of robots' with consciousness and judgementJamoca understands the arrangement (position and height) of the cylinders and choose the best footing position, while walking steadily and accuratelyJamoca is highly reminiscent of Spot, the stealthy four-legged robot dog created by Boston Dynamics, which is already being used by Elon Musk's firm SpaceX to sniff around explosion test sites.Suited for indoor or outdoor use, Spot can map its environment, sense and avoid obstacles, climb stairs and open doors.Spot has been under development by highly secretive US firm Boston Dynamics for years and, unlike Jamoca, is available to purchase \u2013 for just under $75,000 (around \u00a355,800).Spot was announced by Boston Dynamics back in 2016 and underwent various trials before being released commercially on June 17 this year.As part of a pilot phase last year, Boston Dynamics leased 150 Spot robots to domestic and businesses and research facilities to 'document construction progress, monitor remote or hazardous environments and provide situational awareness'.Singapore also employed Spot to roam parks, broadcasting a message reminding pedestrians to keep their distance during the coronavirus outbreak.Spot, the quadruped robot has been developed by Boston Dynamics.

Blackstone, Sequoia, CITIC and JD.com did not respond to requests for comment.Some of the private equity firms are looking to team up with a strategic partner, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the information is confidential.China's internet giants Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings have shown interest and could join a bidding group later in the process, they added. Both declined comment.The interest in FANCL's business outside Japan indicates investor confidence in a consumer recovery in Asia, particularly in China which accounts for around 80% of FANCL Asia's revenue.FANCL, whose products are sold and marketed on Alibaba's TMall, JD.com and Tencent's WeChat, said this year it was in talks with its distributor to launch e-commerce platforms as soon as possible.Alibaba and JD, respectively, generated gross merchandise volume (GMV) of 498.2 billion yuan ($75.3 billion) and 271.5 billion yuan in this year's Singles' Day sales event, with Japan among the top-selling countries.CMC is expected to finalise a shortlist for the second round of bidding by the end of next week and binding bids are due by the end of January, the people said.Asia accounts for 53% of global skincare sales, Euromonitor data showed, with researchers expecting annual growth above 5% in the next five years.Chan is exiting CMC after 25 years as FANCL's sole distributor outside Japan. His contract for China expires in six years and that for the rest of Asia in 10, Reuters has reported.Apart from CMC, FANCL Corp also sells products via its own retail channels outside Japan, sometimes at different prices, people familiar with the situation said.Some bidders are concerned about this practice, which is known as \"parallel import\", as it could cause confusion and hurt business margins and any buyer will have to negotiate with FANCL for future arrangements, they said.FANCL and Kirin Holdings, which owns 30% of the Tokyo-listed company, are not involved in the sale process, the sources have said.

            "description": "What Happened: After entering the streaming business more than a decade ago, Netflix\u2019s growth in the US market is stalling. Now, the company is looking to expand beyond its home turf by unveiling plans to double spending on original content in Asia starting in 2021, Bloomberg reported on December 2.Although Netflix has not disclosed its exact budget, the research firm Media Partners Asia estimates that it will come to a minimum of $1 billion. By ramping up its investment, the streaming platform will position itself to challenge US rivals Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video as well as regional entities like Tencent\u2019s WeTV.Jing Take: What can luxury companies learn from Netflix\u2019s latest move? First, that the Asia-Pacific region offers a massive potential consumer base that goes beyond China. While companies \u2014 for good reasons \u2014 tend to prioritize the Middle Kingdom, the area as a whole is home to 2.9 billion people, which is a third of the world\u2019s population. As of now, Netflix only has 23.5 million subscribers in this market, meaning much of it remains untapped.Second, this consumer base is hungry for content. Asia was the only market where Netflix added more than 1 million paid subscribers during the most recent quarter. That represents nearly half its paid membership growth. Media Partners told Bloomberg it estimates streaming revenue in this region, excluding China, should double to $15 billion by 2025.Third, Asia\u2019s soft power is growing. So there is not only more interest in localized content but also a global appeal for Asian content, especially from South Korea. As such, Netflix has already produced a slew of hit Korean dramas and has five new anime projects in the pipeline.And lastly, Asia has a mobile-first market. Given the region\u2019s growing smartphone penetration and lowering costs for internet connections, Netflix has begun pushing mobile-only plans in places like India, Malaysia, and other parts of Southeast Asia. These subscription plans cost under $5 a month \u2014 a much lower price than in the US ($14) \u2014 which helps to widen the company\u2019s userbase in these emerging markets.The Jing Take reports on a piece of the leading news and presents our editorial team\u2019s analysis of the key implications for the luxury industry. In the recurring column, we analyze everything from product drops and mergers to heated debate sprouting on Chinese social media.",

            "description": "Back in July, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek caught flak for saying it\u2019s no longer enough for artists to record \u201conce every three to four years\u201d\u2014that they need to pump out more product if they want to make a living streaming their music on his platform. As the man cutting their modest checks, Ek would know.Streaming on platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and Pandora accounted for 79.5 percent of the $8.8 billion total global revenue for recorded music last year. But this latest stage of technology\u2019s reordering of the music business has left large chunks of the artist community struggling to make meaningful money from their work. While these platforms generate mammoth revenues through advertising and subscriptions, they pay out negligible amounts per steam, and only a portion of this ends up in creators\u2019 pockets. To make it even worse, Spotify has proposed a new feature that will enable artists and rights holders to boost specific tracks in the platform\u2019s recommendation algorithms provided they agree to a lower royalty rate for those streams. It\u2019s a race to a bottom we didn\u2019t know existed.The shortcomings of the streaming payment model have long been blunted by a swelling live music industry: Streaming barely paid for most artists, the argument went, but at least it facilitated audience expansion so that musicians could better make a living on the road. The pandemic has killed that argument, at least for now\u2014and now many artists must wonder where their next paycheck will come from. It has underlined a profound need to restructure, so that artists can depend on selling their art as well as their time.AdvertisementSome of this will likely depend on the royalties platforms pay to stream artists\u2019 music. But an integral part of any solution may exist within China\u2019s walled-off internet. On several streaming platforms under the umbrella of China\u2019s Tencent Music\u2014QQ Music, Kugou, and Kuwo, as well as WeSing, a karaoke application\u2014micropayments from fans help compensate artists where royalties fall short. This has partially allowed artists to do some smaller-scale hustling every time they release a new album. In part it\u2019s given them a digital tip jar. But it hasn\u2019t been all small change.AdvertisementAdvertisementWhereas western streaming platforms wrestle with profitability, Tencent Music\u2019s operating profits in 2019 were $664 million. What\u2019s interesting is that only around 30 percent of Tencent Music\u2019s revenue comes from subscriptions, music downloads, and advertising revenue; the lion\u2019s share comes through a commission on one-off payments given to artists by listeners, called micropayments. These can be straight-up donations, or given in exchange for virtual goods.For example, a listener can send a few dollars as a sign of appreciation for a live stream performance. They can also customize their application with an artist skin, and purchase behind-the-scenes content or a pre-release streaming block for a new record. In 2016, pop singer Jay Chou sold limited time early access to his Bedtime Stories LP for $3. The platform can then drive fans to engage and spend through gamification, such as offering buyers raffle tickets to win artist merchandise. With Bedtime Stories, Tencent Music published leaderboards showing how many times fans had purchased the album\u2014and the winner exceeded 400.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementThere\u2019s no reason why Tencent Music\u2019s model can\u2019t be applied beyond China. We all inherently crave a deeper emotional bond with our favorite artists, and we will part with money for it. That\u2019s why we splash out on concert tickets. That\u2019s why more than 100,000 people paid at least one dollar to watch Erykah Badu stream from her living room in April. That\u2019s why top creators on WeSing pocket more than $7,000 per month in tips alone.In the west, however, the on-demand streaming model has ruptured the audience-artist relationship. There\u2019s no longer a traditional exchange of X record for Y; instead, platforms like Spotify have become gatekeepers, and music has become more like a utility: unlimited supply for a monthly charge. We listen to curated playlists with the creators demoted to the background, their work consumed by a detached and disengaged audience. With its micropayment features, Tencent Music bridges this gap, and provides artists with a toolkit to foster and more importantly monetize deep fan loyalty.AdvertisementAdvertisementSkeptics might say that the Tencent model wouldn\u2019t work in the west because there isn\u2019t the same culture of tipping over the internet. In China, online tipping is referred to as \u201cda shang,\u201d and it\u2019s been common practice nearly a decade, normalized for anything from live streams to literary works. But western platforms like Anchor and Twitch have been successful in implementing micropayment features in podcasting and gaming, and the same could be true of music. There just has to be a convenient mechanism.AdvertisementSocial media platforms like Facebook have capitalized on this dynamic\u2014the desire for an interaction\u2014to amass billions of global users, and billions of dollars, without rewarding artists for their efforts for their own contributions to these networks. Not only are the artists not rewarded, but they must invest in advertising to reach the followers they attracted to their page in the first place.AdvertisementThe toolkit in the west is materializing. Bandcamp, the independent-focused online music store, has offered the \u201cpay what you wish\u201d model for years. Artists set a minimum purchase price for goods, but leave you free to add more. And during the coronavirus crisis, major streaming platforms have started to tip-toe toward this model. Spotify, for one, has launched \u201cArtist Fundraising Pick,\u201d which allows listeners to make donations via artists\u2019 profiles. That it\u2019s enabling a kind of one-off payment over the platform to occur is encouraging, but it\u2019s not enough, because there is neither a direct exchange nor an additional incentive to trigger action. One manager we spoke with said that none of his three artists, one of which generates more than a million streams a month, had received a single donation.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementOn Patreon, on the other hand, around 4 million fans, or patrons, subscribe to their favorite creators in return for rewards like exclusive songs, physical merchandise, or private lessons. There are no micropayments per se, but the platform is monetizing the direct artist-audience channel, becoming a digital incarnation of a fan club. Between mid-March and late May, the collective value that patrons paid to musicians on Patreon increased by more than 60 percent, and the total number of musician accounts grew by 200 percent.AdvertisementOne major barrier for Patreon is that it exists as an isolated ecosystem separate from where you actually go to listen to music. For enough people to pay, it must be convenient; that\u2019s how Spotify monetized music at a time when piracy made it available for free. It\u2019s a lot to expect listeners to jump to another site, but Patreon does provide a foundation that could feasibly be integrated into a major streaming platform.AdvertisementNone of this is to say it\u2019s as easy as wrapping up Tencent and rolling it out globally. (Nor, again, does this relieve streaming platforms of their responsibility to properly reward artists for their music.) It\u2019s somewhat of a leap to assume a seamless adoption of micropayments in the west, but against a backdrop of our current system\u2019s shortcomings, and as Spotify continues to prioritize podcasting at the expense of musicians whose work it\u2019s long relied upon, they present an alluring revenue source for musicians globally.AdvertisementIn the meantime, we must support artists in any way we can. We can do this by becoming an active listener rather than merely a passive consumer. Subscribe to their Patreon page, if they have one, and consider buying your favorite releases in physical or downloadable form. When you purchase a record, as opposed to streaming it, a larger amount of money ends up with the artist. Among the online platforms, Bandcamp is the most artist-friendly vendor, thanks to its relatively low 15 percent commission. And if you like an album enough to buy it, why not add a tip?Future Tense is a partnership of Slate, New America, and Arizona State University that examines emerging technologies, public policy, and society.",

            "description": "MBW\u2019s Stat Of The Week is a series in which we highlight a data point that deserves the attention of the global music industry. Stat Of the Week is supported by Cinq Music Group, a technology-driven record label, distribution, and rights management company.Regular MBW readers will be well aware of the rising power of the independent and DIY artist market.Recent stunning stats on that score include the fact that TuneCore is now paying out over $400m a year to self-releasing acts, having distributed the music of over a million independent artists to date.Meanwhile, TuneCore rival CD Baby recently confirmed that, in Q2 this year, it counted some 950,000 active distribution clients on its DIY platform.According to Midia Research, the self-releasing artist sector generated $873 million in 2019 \u2013 enough to claim a 4.1% market share of the global recorded music industry.With all of this in mind, China is becoming a particularly interesting hotspot for the DIY artist market \u2013 with the territory\u2019s two biggest streaming platform operators, Tencent Music Entertainment (TME) and NetEase Cloud Music, duking it out for supremacy.Back in July, Tencent Music revealed that it had paid 590 million yuan (over $84m) to date to indie artists using its \u2018Tencent Musician\u2019 program.Launched three years ago, Tencent Musician enables independent artists to upload their music to TME platforms, as well as offering them services such as music publishing, marketing, copyright management and professional training.Last Tuesday (November 10), Tencent Music\u2019s CEO, Cussion Pang, revealed just how beneficial these indie artists are becoming to Tencent\u2019s platforms.\u201cWe saw the number of indie musicians exclusive to [TME platforms in Q3] increase by more than 20 times compared with a year ago \u2013 boosted by a series of financial incentives and technology-based support services.\u201d Cussion Pang, Tencent Music (speaking November 10)Speaking in the wake of Tencent Music\u2019s Q3 results, Pang told analysts that TME was directing \u201cmore resources to support indie musicians and promote original music\u201d.He added: \u201cWe continue to see triple-digit year-over-year growth in both the number of participating indie musicians on the platform, and the number of original songs uploaded to it.\u201dImportantly, Pang further revealed: \u201cWe saw the number of indie musicians exclusive to [TME platforms in Q3] increase by more than 20 times compared with a year ago \u2013 boosted by a series of financial incentives and technology-based support services.\u201dThe fact Tencent Music is offering indie artists \u201cfinancial incentives\u201d is obviously interesting. Even more interesting, however, is the word \u201cexclusive\u201d.Thanks to local anti-competitive crackdowns, Tencent Music is no longer able to exclusively license (and then sub-license) content in China from the likes of Universal Music Group.It appears TME is still enamored with the idea of exclusivity \u2013 but has switched its focus in this area away from record labels, and towards the independent artist market.MBW\u2019s Stat Of The Week: MBW\u2019s Stat Of The Week: Tencent Music has seen \u201ctriple-digit year-over-year growth\u201d in the number of indie artists on its platforms; its rival, NetEase Cloud Music, saw total Chinese indie artists on its service double to 200,000 in the 12 months to October 2020.Tencent Music\u2019s biggest rival in China, NetEase Cloud Music, is also seeing an explosion in activity surrounding independent artists \u2013 with its own rival programs in place to support their work.NetEase\u2018s Project Cloud Ladder, for example, is dubbed by the company as \u201can initiative to encourage independent musicians to create better music\u201d.What does that entail?Well, we know that the services laid on by NetEase Cloud Music for independent artists can go way beyond your typical DIY distribution offering.\u201cNetEase [is] strengthening our support of, and investment in, independent musicians [via] dedicated teams of professional songwriters, composers, producers as well as other resources such as AI technology and marketing solutions.\u201d William Ding, NetEase (speaking November 19)NetEase (NetEase Cloud Music\u2019s parent) released its Q3 results on Wednesday (November 19). The firm\u2019s CEO, William Ding, subsequently spoke specifically about the importance of wooing independent artists during a call with analysts.Said Ding (translated): \u201cNetEase continues to emphasize our original music library by strengthening our support of, and investment in, independent musicians [via] dedicated teams of professional songwriters, composers, producers as well as other resources such as AI technology and marketing solutions.\u201dThe idea that NetEase can help indie artists \u201ccreate better music\u201d isn\u2019t just marketing spiel, then: the platform is literally hooking up the cream of China\u2019s indie artist community with hit-making songwriters and producers, in order to yield professional-level material.If NetEase Cloud Music was a record label or music publisher, that might be called A&R.According to recent stats published by NetEase, in October 2020, NetEase Cloud Music was home to music from over 200,000 Chinese independent musicians \u2013 representing 100% year-on-year growth in volume terms.A report from NetEase on its work with independent artists, published November 6, suggests that, as recently as 2016, the platform only hosted music from 20,000 indie acts.\u201cOnline music platforms have greatly impacted the release pattern of music in China and empowered more musicians to have the chance to shine and thrive in the industry,\u201d NetEase said in a statement accompanying the report.As well as revealing NetEase Cloud Music\u2019s internal stats, this report surveyed 11,857 independent artists to ascertain how they were faring on the platform in 2020.It concluded that, since 2017, over 40% of independent musicians in China had seen \u201cobvious revenue growth\u201d.NetEase added that the total revenue of independent artists participating in its Project Cloud Ladder exceeded RMB 100 million (circa $15m) in the first 10 months of 2020.It appears, then, that a heated tussle is breaking out between Tencent Music and NetEase Cloud Music to become the preferred home of indie artists in China \u2013 with significant business benefits awaiting the victor.William Ding was asked about NetEase Cloud Music\u2019s rivalry with Tencent Music on NetEase\u2019s Q3 earnings call, and used the question to reiterate the importance of indie musicians to his company\u2019s prospects.\u201cWe are very confident and ambitious that in the future, NetEase Cloud Music will have a leading market share,\u201d said Ding (translated).\u201cThe way for us to [achieve that leading market share] is to [place] emphasis on original and organic music\u2026 [while], at the same time, providing resources to support and nurture China\u2019s independent musicians in supplying more and more high quality music content, building a healthy cycle organically.\u201d\u201cNetEase\u2019s efforts to help independent musicians to be heard and appreciated give us a competitive edge.\u201d NetEase company statementIn a company statement given to MBW earlier this month in conjunction with its indie artist report, NetEase Cloud Music talked of its \u201cmission to help tens of thousands of talented Chinese independent musicians create indigenous content that resonates with local listeners\u201d.It added: \u201cNetEase\u2019s efforts to help independent musicians to be heard and appreciated give us a competitive edge.\u201cIn this way, fostering the growth of independent music both opens up a bigger market for the musicians, and introduces original and diversified content to our users, which contributes to sustainable growth.\u201dAccording to Tencent Music\u2019s latest quarterly results, the company ended Q3 2020 with 646m Monthly Active Mobile Users of its online music services.As it has for some time, NetEase said in its Q3 results that NetEase Cloud Music has over 800m registered users (though registered does not necessarily mean active).Cinq Music Group\u2019s repertoire has won Grammy awards, dozens of Gold and Platinum RIAA certifications, and numerous No.1 chart positions on a variety of Billboard charts. Its repertoire includes heavyweights such as Bad Bunny, Janet Jackson, Daddy Yankee, T.I., Sean Kingston, Anuel, and hundreds more.Music Business Worldwide",

            "description": "In a much-anticipated move, California-based gaming firm Roblox filed to go public last week. One aspect driving the future growth of the children- and community-focused gaming platform is its China entry, which it fleshes out in detail for the first time in its IPO prospectus.Like all gaming companies entering China, Roblox must work with a local publishing and operations partner. And like Riot Games, Supercell, Epic Games, Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft, Nintendo and many more, Roblox chose Tencent, the world\u2019s largest gaming firm by revenue, according to Newzoo.The partnership, which began in 2019, revolves around a joint venture in which Roblox holds a 51% controlling stake and a Tencent affiliate called Songhua owns a 49% interest. The prospectus notes that Tencent currently intends to publish and operate a localized version of the Roblox Platform (\u7f57\u5e03\u4e50\u601d). Internationally, the platform allows people to create games and play those programmed by others.User-generated content is in part what makes Roblox popular amongst young gamers, but that social aspect almost certainly makes its China entry trickier. It\u2019s widely understood that the Chinese government is asserting more control over what gets published on the internet, and in recent times its scrutiny over gaming content has heightened. Industry veteran Wenfeng Yang went as far as speculating that games with user-generated content will \u201cnever made [their] path to China,\u201d citing the example of Animal Crossing.Roblox says it believes it\u2019s \u201cuniquely positioned\u201d to grow its penetration in China but its \u201cperformance will be dependent on\u201d Tencent\u2019s ability to clear regulatory hurdles. It\u2019s unclear what measures Roblox will take to prevent its user-generated content from running afoul of the Chinese authorities, whose appetite for what is permitted can be volatile. Tencent itself has been in the crosshairs of regulators over allegedly \u201caddictive\u201d and \u201charmful\u201d gaming content. It also remains to be seen how Roblox ensures its user experience won\u2019t be compromised by whatever censorship system that gets implemented.ComplianceAt the most basic level, Roblox claims it works to ensure user safety through measures designed \u201cto enforce real-world laws,\u201d including text-filtering, content moderation, automated systems to identify behaviors in violation of platform policies, and a review team. The company expresses in its filing optimism about getting China\u2019s regulatory greenlight:\u201cWhile Tencent is still working to obtain the required regulatory license to publish and operate Luobulesi [Roblox\u2019s local name] in China, we believe the regulatory requirements specific to China will be met. In the meantime, Luobu is working towards creating a robust developer community in China.\u201dThe company is rightfully optimistic. Tencent has a proven history of converting its social network users into gamers and publishing foreign games. Roblox\u2019s marketing focus on encouraging \u201ccreativity\u201d could sit well with Beijing\u2019s call for tech companies to \u201cdo good,\u201d an order Tencent has answered. Roblox\u2019s Chinese website suggests it\u2019s touting part of its business as a learning and STEM tool and shows it\u2019s seeking collaborations with local schools and educators.\u201cRoblox is aimed at a younger audience and the majority of its content will not be an issue in China,\u201d said games analyst from Niko Partners Daniel Ahmad to TechCrunch. \u201cHowever, we do see some risk from its user-generated content features which can be used in ways that Chinese regulators may disapprove.\u201dThere might be an easier path into China. Yang, who is the U.S. general manager for China-listed games maker Yoozoo, told TechCrunch that \u201cRoblox China may only introduce the platform to Chinese developers, asking them to join and make content for the global market, not necessarily bringing the platform to China under such heavy regulations.\u201dForeign games overall are having a more difficult time entering China, In 2019 there were 185 foreign games approved for release in the country, but that there have only been 56 foreign games approved year to date, Ahmad noted.GeopoliticsThe involvement of Tencent, while critical, is the elephant in the room in times of uncertain U.S.-China relations. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. or CFIUS, which is chaired by the Treasury Department, was inquiring about data practices by Tencent-backed gaming studios in the U.S. including Epic and Riot, Bloomberg reported in September.Roblox isn\u2019t exempt. It notes in the prospectus that CFIUS has \u201cmade inquiries to us with respect to Tencent\u2019s equity investment in us and involvement in the China JV.\u201d It further warns that it \u201ccannot predict what effect any further inquiry by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. into our relationship with Tencent or changes in China-U.S. relations overall may have on our ability to effectively support the China JV or on the operations or success of the China JV.\u201dThe other obstacle faced by all foreign companies entering China, the world\u2019s biggest gaming market, is local clones. Reworld, backed by prominent Chinese venture firms such as Northern Light Venture Capital and Joy Capital, is one. The game is unabashed about its origin. In a Reddit post responding to the accusation of it being \u201ca ripoff of Roblox,\u201d Reworld pays its tribute to Roblox and admits its product is \u201cbuilt on the shoulders of Roblox,\u201d while claiming \u201cit did not take any code from Roblox Studio.\u201dThe Beijing-based startup behind Reworld has so far raised more than $50 million and had about 100 developers working on Reworld\u2019s editing tool and 50 other operational staff, its co-founder said in a June interview. In comparison, Roblox had 38 employees in China by September, 38 of whom were in product and engineering functions. It\u2019s actively hiring in China.Roblox cannot comment for the story as it\u2019s in the IPO quiet period.Added expert comments on November 23, 2020.",

            "description": "World Wide Web worriesA yearly internet forum in China, home to the \u201cChinese Firewall\u201d and known for its massive restrictions of its domestic internet, underlines the fact that the idea of a truly global internet for all does not have much chance to ever being realized. Recent actions by India and the US risk fracturing the World Wide Web even more.Tencent Holdings Ltd Chairman and CEO Pony Ma speaks at the fifth World Internet Conference (WIC) in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, China, November 7, 2018.Advertising Read moreIt sounds idealistic: \u201cbuilding a community with a shared future in cyberspace\u201d, the slogan of the Wuzhen Internet Conference 2020, its official site supported by a flashy videos, proclaims. \u201cCountries [should] follow the trend of the times,\u201d the site explains, \u201cshoulder responsibility for development \u2026 and jointly promote global governance in cyberspace.\u201dThe three-day forum focuses primarily on technology, with discussions on \u201cBelt and Road cooperation in cyberspace\u201d and \u201cyouth and digital future.\u201dBut the Wuzhen conference hides deep fault lines that run through the internet and indicate that those fault lines are about to split wide open.The Wuzhen event, held near the picturesque fishing village of the same name, is now in its sixth year an showcases \u201ccutting-edge scientific and technological achievements in areas technology areas like artificial intelligence, cloud computing, big data, blockchain and 5G,\u201d according to the state-controlled website China.org.cn. Many of the meetings take place online, due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\"We remain committed to building an international platform for connecting China and the world, and a Chinese platform for an internet, shared and governed by all,\" Zhuang Rongwen, minister of the organizer, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) was quoted as saying.The main goal of CAC and the Wuzhen conference? Presenting the world with an \u201calternative\u201d way to administer the WWW.In 2014, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that while \"China is ready to work with other countries to deepen international cooperation,\u201d the \u201csovereignty of the Internet\u201d should be respected, and governments should work on an \u201cinternational internet governance system.\u201dIn practice, this means that while \u201cthe internet provides individuals with greater freedom to speak and share information,\u201d this cannot be a free-for-all, according to Beijing.\u201cThe public should also be responsible for their speech and conscientious about disseminating information that will harm the country's development,\u201d according to the pro-China\u2019s Communist Party newspaper Global Times. \"Measures must be taken to prevent \u201crumormongering\u201d that can \u201charm the nation,\" it added.Government scrutinyToday, it is increasingly clear what China\u2019s \u201cinternet governance model\u201d stands for. Some aspects may find echoes in Western calls to break up internet giants such as Google, Facebook and Amazon. The Wuzhen event takes place as the China\u2019s own internet giants, including Alibaba, Tencent Holdings and Meituan face increasing government scrutiny.Earlier this month the planned $37 billion share market listing of Alibaba affiliate Ant Group was suspended after regulators warned its lucrative online lending business faced tighter scrutiny.Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce marketplaces and payment services are also expected to face greater oversight under the draft rules published on 10 November by China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation, which said it wanted to prevent platforms from dominating the market or from adopting methods aimed at blocking fair competition.World Wide Web worriesBut apart from commercial concerns, Wuzhen comes at a time when internet censorship in China went into high gear.The World Wide Web, the user friendly interface of the internet created by Tim Berners-Lee and Cern in 1989 was meant to connect people world wide and without restrictions.But China already issued regulations to restrict access to the internet in 1994, one full year before even the first Chinese citizen could log in. Other authoritarian regimes, such as Vietnam, Iran and Cuba followed the Chinese example.When the cyber gates opened wider, China quickly grew into the largest internet user concentration in the world. But Chinese cyberspace was restricted by a net of growing rules and regulations, software filters, culminating in the Great Chinese Firewall, defending \"malignant outside influence\" with a \"golden shield,\"project initiated by ... the CAC, that also organizes the Wuzhen Internet conference.\"Meanwhile, cyber police monitors and censors any message that is unwanted by the government, and hunts down people who post comments critical of the Communist Party, while making internet-related \u201ccrimes\u201d punishable with long jail terms.Splinternet?And while China and other centrally controlled states increasingly compartimentilise the internet, the general idea of \u201cuniversality\u201d of the WWW was further hampered with growing concerns that Chinese applications were \u2018snooping up\u2019 private user data.In April, anti-Chinese internet frenzy reached a boiling point when user of popular video app TikTok claimed that it radically invaded privacy.The user, who posted his \u201canalysis\u201d on Reddit under the name \u2018Bangorlol\u2019 said that TikTok snooped up hardware IDs, memory usage, apps installed, IP addresses, Wi-Fi access points, GPS pings at a temporal resolution of 30 seconds.True or not, the Indian government, already entangled in an increasingly tense border dispute with China, banned TikTok and 58 other Chinese applications. One month later, the hammer fell when US President Donald Trump issued an executive order aimed at eventually banning TikTok and its owner ByteDance Ltd.Tim fights backMeanwhile, WWW founder Tim Berners-Lee has turned himself into an activist fighting government restrictions imposed by governments for whatever reasons when he published his \u201cContract for the Web\u201d that aims to \u201censure everyone can connect to the internet,\u201d while \u201call of the internet\u201d should be kept available \u201call of the time\u201d. This means that companies and governments must \u201crespect and protect people\u2019s fundamental online privacy and data rights.\u201dTo date, the \u201ccontract\u201d is endorsed by 563 companies dealing with the internet, including China-based companies such as YQTC Tech.Daily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe",

After PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) was banned in India earlier this year along with several other apps and software of Chinese origin.On Saturday, the official website of the new PUBG India mobile game added download links which gave hope to the users of the launch being earlier than expected. The website showed two download options, the first led to an APK download link and the second led to the Google Play store. However, none of the links worked. The small tease by the developers has got the PUBG fans excited, and they have decided to express their emotions through memes.The fans of PUBG mobile are eagerly waiting for the India specific version of the game. South Korean company Krafton Inc, the parent company of PUBG has severed ties with Chinese firm Tencent Games for India operations. The teasers of PUBG Mobile India have been out already but now some reports say that a trailer will be out soon. PUBG Mobile India pre-registration is already underway.Pre-registration for PUBG Mobile India is already going on for select Android and iOS users on the Tap game sharing community. The listing says that the game will be available in English as well as in Hindi.PUBG reportedly is in the process of setting up an Indian subsidiary for its presence in India. It will hire 100 people from gaming, business, and game development background. PUBG Mobile India is being designed with Indian sensibilities and preferences in mind. Krafton Inc has tied up with Microsoft Azure to address the issues of data security of Indian users.To assuage privacy and data security concerns, PUBG had stated that it will conduct regular audits and verifications on the storage systems holding Indian users\u2019 personally identifiable information to reinforce security and ensure that their data is safely managed.Moreover, the developer has ensured that the Indian version of the popular First Person Shooter (FPS) game will include a feature that places restrictions on game time to promote healthy gameplay habits for younger players.Published By: Akarsh Verma Published On: Nov 21, 2020 --- ENDS ---",

            "description": "New draft rules could affect some of China\u2019s most popular e-commerce firms, including Alibaba and Tencent.Several governments are trying to defang the growing financial and economic might of tech giants, but few have the political leeway that China has.China\u2019s government published draft antitrust rules this week aimed at curbing monopolistic behaviour by its giant internet platforms, a move that analysts believe will lead to increased scrutiny of e-commerce marketplaces as well as food delivery and payment platforms, among others.The move took investors by surprise, wiping hundreds of billions of dollars off the market value of some of the world\u2019s biggest tech companies.The proposed rules are meant to protect or encourage fair competition and to safeguard consumers.This is a dramatic shift from the mostly hands-off approach the government has adopted so far with its tech giants.And while President Xi Jinping\u2019s government has not explained what led to the draft rules, the move is likely to affect some of the biggest internet firms in China including e-commerce giants like Alibaba, JD.com and Pinduoduo, as well as food delivery platform Meituan, and social media and gaming giant Tencent, among others.So what are these companies being accused of doing?Alibaba and Tencent dominate China\u2019s growing ecosystem of tech platforms that allow users to chat with friends and family, transfer money, shop online, take out loans, order a ride-hailing car, stream music and movies, play online games and much more.Some of the things these firms have been accused of doing include the compulsory collection of user data, treating customers differently based on their spending habits and setting algorithm-based prices favouring new users.One of the most egregious examples of supposed arm-twisting by tech firms involves a \u201cpick one of two\u201d tactic, in which vendors \u2013 usually small enterprises \u2013 are forced to choose between Alibaba and e-commerce platforms such as Pinduoduo, in which Tencent is a shareholder.Why is the government clamping down now?While the large Chinese platforms have been accused of these kinds of practices for a while, it is unclear what made the government unleash these proposals now. China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation, the body which regulates monopolies and which issued the draft, said it wanted to prevent platforms from dominating the market or from adopting methods aimed at blocking fair competition.Last year, the body called more than 20 platforms to a meeting to ask them to stop pushing vendors to sign exclusive agreements.Did the economic fallout of the pandemic speed things up?COVID-19 may have pushed the issue further up the market regulator\u2019s agenda. As China emerged from the painful lockdowns to curb the spread of the virus earlier this year, large tech firms benefitted from a surge in e-commerce, while smaller brick-and-mortar businesses struggled. Faced with the possibility of worsening an already alarming inequality problem, Beijing might have decided it was time to get tough.According to Bloomberg News, a year ago, e-commerce accounted for about 25 percent of total retail sales; now, it is edging towards 30 percent.Was there any warning that change was imminent?The rules were unveiled after China\u2019s Financial Stability and Development Committee, a cabinet-level body headed by Vice Premier Liu He, flagged last month the need to improve mechanisms to ensure fair competition and called for the strengthening of anti-monopoly law enforcement.They also come after the overnight suspension last week of the $35bn initial public offering (IPO) of Ant Group, an Alibaba affiliate which provides an array of payment and financial services, in what was billed to be the world\u2019s largest-ever listing, after regulators warned the financial technology firm that its online lending business would face tougher scrutiny.Wasn\u2019t halting that Ant IPO a big deal?It sure was. The sudden halt to the IPO shocked investors and markets globally who saw it as a step by the Chinese government to rein in Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma who, at a news conference just days before Ant\u2019s IPO, criticised the government for stifling innovation.What have the companies said about the new draft rules?Alibaba did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera\u2019s request for comment.Meanwhile, Tencent\u2019s President Martin Lau has tried to reassure investors about the effect the new rules would have on his company.He said the operator of the WeChat instant messaging-to-payments platform supports the government\u2019s goals of fair competition and that its social media and entertainment empire operates within competitive fields. He also made clear the company will comply with regulators\u2019 policies, Bloomberg reported.How have investors reacted to the proposed rules?They have been spooked! In the days since the draft rules were revealed, Chinese tech giants lost almost $290bn in market value as investors frantically sold the stocks. Between Tuesday and Wednesday, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Tech Index was down 11 percent, though it had recouped some of those losses by Friday following Tencent\u2019s statement.Given the market reaction, will the draft rules be enforced?It is not clear whether the draft policies, which are open for public feedback until the end of November, will be enforced or not. If they do kick in, they are expected to have a negative effect on the more dominant firms.One potential effect could be to end the practice of aggressively discounting, at times to below cost price, in order to gain market share.Companies that exchange user data could also take a hit to their revenues, analysts say.How will this affect the little guys? Consumers and small businesses?The proposed rules are meant to protect consumers and small business owners who use online platforms to sell their goods. The regulations would theoretically reduce compliance costs for business operators and encourage the healthy growth of the platform economy.But the lack of detail so far in the government\u2019s plans makes it unclear whether it will be able to achieve those goals.",

            "description": "Are you looking to showcase your brand in front of the brightest minds of the gaming industry? Consider getting a custom GamesBeat sponsorship. Learn more.The U.S.-China trade war has taken another turn after U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order that will put an end to WeChat and TikTok transactions, halting any possibility of Americans doing business with the companies that own these apps \u2014 Tencent and ByteDance. Lately, the U.S. has been especially wary of national security threats supposedly posed by Chinese social media apps, particularly TikTok which has a huge base of users in the U.S.The consequences of banning these apps in the U.S. are hard to realize with complete clarity at this point because the factors influencing how the situation will roll out following the enforcement of these executive orders are yet to come into play \u2014 such as American companies buying these Chinese apps or the extent to which the prohibitions will be enforced in practice.Nonetheless, considering the passing of these unusual executive orders against Chinese apps in the first place, there is clearly a potential for abuse of presidential powers on the part of the Trump administration. If these bans go beyond the transactional level, it won\u2019t only affect users of TikTok and WeChat, but may also have serious ramifications for a huge section of the American online gaming community since Tencent is the company behind some of the most popular games played in the country.Why does the U.S. want to ban Tencent services?It all boils down to that oft-used yet vague term \u201cnational security.\u201d The fears voiced by the Trump administration are that these Chinese apps like TikTok share American citizens\u2019 data with the Chinese government.Event GamesBeat at the Game Awards We invite you to join us in LA for GamesBeat at the Game Awards event this December 7. Reserve your spot now as space is limited!Learn MoreYet if invasive data collection practices are indeed the problem, then it\u2019s unclear why the same aggressive stance hasn\u2019t been taken against American tech companies like Facebook and Google that perform the same level of invasive surveillance as TikTok.So, if you want to go by the official word, then \u201cnational security\u201d is the motive behind the ban on Tencent and ByteDance services. The real reason is likely more political than self-defense, bearing in mind Trump\u2019s history of sinophobic rhetoric.The U.S. government has banned no apps or services from Chinese companies at the time of this writing. Judges blocked the U.S. government\u2019s attempt to ban WeChat, deeming it a constitutional violation to enforce such heavy-handed bans on apps used by millions in the U.S.As things stand, the possibility of a complete ban on WeChat is unlikely to pass through the U.S. courts. But in case these bans do take effect, things could get somewhat complicated for Tencent. Indeed, even though ByteDance\u2019s TikTok has been the subject of most media coverage as regards the possibility of a ban and the impact of restrictions on TikTok, it is the ban on Tencent\u2019s services that represent even deeper consequences.This is because Tencent owns video game companies like Riot games and Epic Games, who developed the insanely popular online game League of Legends and Fortnite respectively. Although the executive orders from Trump specifically target WeChat transactions, it invokes the much broader International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which could apply to any subsidiary of Tencent.Therefore, even if it\u2019s WeChat that is directly under the crosshairs of the Trump administration right now, the prohibitions could potentially creep over to other Tencent-owned businesses in the future. This could leave a serious impact on the gaming community, and indeed, many other businesses that Tencent has a share in.Ramifications of a U.S. ban on Tencent gaming companiesThe language in the executive order issued by the Trump administration is broad enough that it alarmed everyone into thinking that Tencent-owned video game companies will also be affected by it. However, the Los Angeles Times received confirmation from the White House that they only aim to block transactions on WeChat and aren\u2019t planning to block the video games:https://twitter.com/SamAugustDean/status/1291576813685108736?At the same time, there\u2019s nothing stopping them from going after other Tencent companies in the future. If that happens, online video gaming and even global esports may be drastically affected.What if the U.S. Imposed a Ban on Tencent Gaming Companies?To put things in perspective, here is a short list of all the companies that Tencent has stakes in:Riot Games \u2014 the developer behind League of Legends and the recently launched game Valorant \u2014 is 100% owned by Tencentowned by Tencent Tencent developed PUBG Mobile for smartphones, a highly popular game in the U.S.Epic Games \u2014 the developer behind Fortnite \u2014 is 40% owned by Tencentowned by Tencent Tencent owns 80% of Supercell, the studio that made Clash of Clansof Supercell, the studio that made Clash of Clans Small, single-digit stakes in Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft, PlatinumGames, and moreTencent has 9% stake in Spotify and 12% take in Snap (the owner of Snapchat)With this in mind, it is easy to see why placing prohibitions on anything related to Tencent is a dangerous path. The League of Legends World Championship prize in 2018 was USD 6.45 million. The Fortnite Championship took this even farther and handed out USD 30 million in prizes during the 2019 Fortnite World Cup. If Tencent is to be banned, the esports industry will certainly endure a huge blow in the United States and, indeed, globally.The same goes for games like Fortnite and the newly launched Valorant, which is also expected to become widely played as other titles from Riot Games. According to a CNBC article, Riot Games\u2019 League of Legends is still drawing 8 million concurrent players every day, even after 10 years since the game\u2019s launch.Another popular game \u2014 PUBG Mobile, developed by Tencent\u2019s own gaming studio \u2014 raked in $1.3 billion worldwide in the first half only worldwide.A ban on Tencent would be disastrous for the company as well as gamers, and it isn\u2019t unreasonable to worry about the possibility of the U.S. going forward with this ban.In fact, PUBG Corporation has announced that they\u2019re taking over publishing responsibilities from Tencent for the game PUBG Mobile in India, since it is one of the 118 Chinese apps banned by India amidst escalating border conflict with China. If India could take this step over national security concerns, the possibility that the U.S. will also follow suit and ban video games from Tencent-owned companies isn\u2019t as far-fetched as we\u2019d like to believe.If Tencent\u2019s video gaming projects are indeed banned in the U.S., it would rob many gamers of their chance to participate and win competitions involving the video games they\u2019ve been playing personally as well as professionally for years now.Games like League of Legends and Fortnite are a big reason behind the booming global popularity of esports competitions. If these titles are shelved in the U.S., the industry will likely suffer a noticeable dip in audience interest in esports and any potential investments that Tencent might have planned for the industry will be terminated.For the gaming industry as a whole, these are serious losses that are simply not worth incurring over vague \u201cnational security\u201d concerns that the Trump administration is referencing.How to go about a ban in order to continue gaming?In case the ban is imposed, the U.S. government may demand the removal of apps owned by ByteDance, Tencent, and their subsidiaries from the Google Play Store and the iOS App Store. As noted by The Verge, deplatforming TikTok and other apps could greatly reduce usage of these apps even if they could still be sideloaded.It is hard to predict the exact methods the government will apply to enforce the blocking of these apps. However, we fear that authorities might perform an IP or server level blocking if they were serious about cutting off access drastically. This method is even more restrictive than deplatforming because the only way users would be able to access Tencent and ByteDance apps would be through VPNs.Since most VPN services for gaming cost money, it doesn\u2019t make sense to spend some cash just to be able to unblock apps like TikTok, which are essentially free for use. The same goes for League of Legends, Valorant, PUBG; all are free-to-play video games with the option of unlocking premium content with in-game purchases.Regardless, users will be able to access these apps through VPNs if these are blocked by IP addresses. But things could get tricky if the U.S. follows the methods supposedly applied by India to block TikTok in the country i.e. device ID blocking.If device IDs trying to access TikTok or Tencent-owned games are already blocked, then even VPNs would be rendered ineffective as it happened for users trying to access TikTok with VPNs. While VPNs cannot bypass a device ID ban, they can prevent it from getting banned in the first place.So, if you\u2019re careful and use VPNs before accessing banned apps at all times, the government won\u2019t suspect your device to put it in the blacklist.ConclusionThe United States could be setting a dangerous precedent having uncertain consequences if it sets upon this banning-spree of Chinese-based apps.Considering the fact that Tencent has stakes in some of the most hugely popular online video games in the U.S., these bans have the potential to impact the gaming industry as a whole.Though, it is important to remember that, as per the current understanding of most commentators, it is only WeChat and TikTok that are being considered for a ban rather than the gaming studios and other companies that Tencent has stakes in.At any rate, the legal system of the U.S. poses a big challenge for the government to face, as judges have already passed a preliminary injunction preventing the government from banning WeChat, a decision which the Trump administration has now appealed against.Although it is premature to expect with any degree of certainty that the scope of prohibitions would not exceed WeChat transactions and creep over to video game studios, having serious consequences for the gaming industry as a whole, upcoming developments could still influence things in Tencent and ByteDane\u2019s favor.Upcoming developments could still influence things in Tencent and ByteDance\u2019s favor; thus it is still premature to expect with any degree of certainty that the scope of prohibitions would exceed WeChat transactions and creep over to video game studios and affect the online gaming industry.Aurangzeb A.

            "description": "As Ant Group seizes the world\u2019s attention with its record initial public offering, which was abruptly called off by Beijing, investors and analysts are revisiting the fintech interests of Tencent, Ant\u2019s arch rival in China.It\u2019s somewhat complicated to do this, not least because they are sprawled across a number of Tencent properties and, unlike Ant, don\u2019t go by a single brand or operational structure \u2014 at least, not one that is obvious to the outside world.However, when you tease out Tencent\u2019s fintech activity across its wider footprint \u2014 from direct operations like WeChat Pay through to its sizeable strategic investments and third-party marketplaces \u2014 you have something comparable in size to Ant, and in some services even bigger.Hidden businessAnt refuted the comparison with Tencent or anyone else. In a reply to China\u2019s securities regulator in September, the Jack Ma-controlled, Alibaba-backed fintech giant said it is \u201cnot comparable\u201d to WeChat Pay, the fintech tool inside WeChat, Tencent\u2019s flagship messenger.\u201cIn the space of digital payments and merchant service, there are many players around the world, including Tencent\u2019s WeChat Pay. But the payments services offered by these companies are different from our digital payments and merchant services. They are not comparable. In terms of digital finance, our way of working with and serving financial institutions, as well as our revenue model, are novel and do not have a counterpart,\u201d the company noted in a somewhat hubristic reply.There\u2019s no denying that Ant is a pioneer in expanding financial inclusion in China, where millions remain outside the formal banking system. But Tencent has played catch-up in digital finance and made major headway, especially in electronic payments.Both companies ventured into fintech by first offering consumers a way to pay digitally, though the brands \u201cAlipay\u201d and \u201cWeChat Pay\u201d fail to reflect the breadth of services touted by the platforms today. Alipay, Ant\u2019s flagship app, is now a comprehensive marketplace selling Ant\u2019s in-house products and myriad third-party ones like micro-loans and insurance. The app, like WeChat Pay, also facilitates a growing list of public services, letting users see their taxes, pay utility bills, book a hospital visit and more.Tencent, on the other hand, embeds its financial services inside the payment features of WeChat (WeChat Pay) and the giant\u2019s other popular chat app, QQ. It has thus been historically difficult to make out how much Tencent earns from fintech, something the giant doesn\u2019t disclose in its earnings reports. This is reflective of Tencent\u2019s \u201chorse racing\u201d internal competition, in which departments and teams often rival fiercely against each other rather than actively collaborate.As such, we have pulled together estimates of Tencent\u2019s fintech businesses ourselves using a mix of quarterly reports and third-party research \u2014 a mark of how un-transparent some of this really is \u2014 but it begs some interesting questions. Will (should?) Tencent at some point follow in Alibaba\u2019s footsteps to bring its own fintech operations under one umbrella?User numberIn terms of user size, the rivals are going neck and neck.The Alipay app recorded 711 monthly active users and 80 million monthly merchants in June. Among its 1 billion annual users, 729 million had transacted in at least one \u201cfinancial service\u201d through the platform. As in the PayPal-eBay relationship, Alipay benefits tremendously by being the default payments processor for Alibaba marketplaces like Taobao.As of 2019, more than 800 million users and 50 million merchants used WeChat to pay monthly, a big chunk of the 1.2 billion active user base of the messenger. It\u2019s unclear how many people tried Tencent\u2019s other fintech products, though the firm did say about 200 million people used its wealth management service in 2019.RevenueAnt reported a total of 121 billion yuan or $17 billion in revenue last year, nearly doubling its sum from 2017 and putting it on par with PayPal at $17.8 billion.In 2019, Tencent generated 101 billion yuan of revenue from its \u201cfintech and business services. The segment mainly consisted of fintech and cloud products, industry analysts told TechCrunch. With its cloud unit finishing the year at 17 billion yuan in revenue, we can venture to estimate that Tencent\u2019s fintech products earned roughly or no more than 84 billion yuan ($12 billion), from the period \u2014 paled by Ant\u2019s figure, but not bad for a relative latecomer.The sheer size of the fintech giants has made them highly attractive targets of regulation. Increasingly, Ant is downplaying its \u201cfinancial\u201d angle and billing itself as a \u201ctechnology\u201d ally for traditional institutions rather than a challenger. These days, Alipay relies less on selling proprietary financial products and bills itself as an intermediary helping state banks, wealth managers and insurers to reach customers. In return for facilitating the process, Ant charges administrative fees from transactions on the platform.Now, let\u2019s turn to the rivals\u2019 four main business focuses: payments, microloans, wealth management and insurance.Digital paymentsIn the year ended June, Alipay processed a whopping 118 trillion yuan in payment transactions in China. That\u2019s about $17 trillion and dwarfs the $172 billion that PayPal handled in 2019.Tencent doesn\u2019t disclose its payments transaction volume, but data from third-party research firms offer a hint of its scale. The industry consensus is that the two collectively control over 90% of China\u2019s trillion-dollar electronic payments market where Alipay enjoys a slight lead.Alipay processed 55.4% of China\u2019s third-party payments transactions in the first quarter of 2020, according to market research firm iResearch, while another researcher Analysys said the firm\u2019s share was 48.44% in the period. In comparison, Tenpay (the brand assigned to the company-wide infrastructure that powers WeChat Pay and the less-significant QQ Wallet, yet another name to confuse people) trailed behind at 38.8%, per iResearch data, and 34% according to Analysys.At the end of the day, the two services have distinct user scenarios. The fact that WeChat Pay lies inside a messenger makes it a tool for social, often small, payments, such as splitting bills and exchanging lucky money, a custom in China. Alipay, on the other hand, is associated with online shopping.That\u2019s changing as Tencent tries to increase its ticket size through alliances. It\u2019s tied WeChat Pay to portfolio e-commerce companies like JD.com, Pinduoduo and Meituan \u2014 all Alibaba\u2019s competitors.Third-party payments were once an incredibly profitable business. Platforms used to be able to hold customer reserve funds from which they generated handsome interests. That lucrative scheme came to a stop when Chinese regulators demanded non-bank payments providers to place 100% of customer deposit funds under a centralized, interest-free account last year. What\u2019s left for payment processors to earn are limited fees charged from merchants.Payments still account for the bulk of Ant\u2019s revenues \u2014 43%, or a total of 51.9 billion yuan ($7.6 billion) in 2019, but the percentage was down from 55% in 2017, a sign of the giant\u2019s diversifying business.MicrolendingAnt has become the go-to lender for shoppers and small businesses in a country where millions aren\u2019t qualified for bank-issued credit cards. The firm had worked with about 100 banks, doling out 1.7 trillion yuan ($250 billion) of consumer loans and 400 billion yuan ($58 billion) of small business loans in the year ended June. That amounted to 41.9 billion yuan or 34.7% of Ant\u2019s annual revenue.The size of Tencent\u2019s loan business is harder to gauge. What we do know is that Weilidai, the microloan product sold through WeChat, had issued an aggregate of 3.7 trillion yuan ($540 billion) to 28 million customers between its launch in 2015 and 2019, according to a report from WeBank, the Tencent-backed private bank that provides the WeChat-based loan.Wealth managementAs of June, Ant had 4.1 trillion yuan ($600 billion) assets under management, making it one of the world\u2019s biggest money-market funds. Working with 170 partner asset managers, the segment brought in about 17 billion yuan or 14% of total revenue in 2019.Tencent said its wealth management platform accumulated assets of over 600 billion yuan in 2018 and grew by 50% year-over-year in 2019. That should put its AUM in 2019 at around 900 billion yuan ($131 billion).InsuranceLast but not least, both giants have made big pushes into consumer insurance. Besides featuring third-party plans, Alipay introduced a new way to insure customers: mutual aid. The novel scheme, which is not regulated as an insurance product in China, is free to sign up and does not charge any premium or upfront payment. Users pay small monthly fees that are pooled to pay for claims of critical illnesses.Insurance premiums and mutual aid contributions on Ant\u2019s platform reached 52 billion yuan, or $7.6 billion, in the year ended June. Working with about 90 partner insurers in China, the segment contributed nearly 9 billion yuan, or 7.4%, of the firm\u2019s annual revenue. More than 570 million Alipay users participated in at least one insurance program in the year ended June.Tencent, on the other hand, taps partners in its relatively uncharted territory. Its insurance strategy includes in-house platform WeSure that works like a middleman between insurers and consumers, and Tencent-backed Waterdrop, which provides both traditional insurances and a rival to Ant\u2019s mutual aid product Xianghubao.In the first half of 2020, WeSure, Tencent\u2019s main insurance operation that sells through WeChat, paid out a total of 290 million yuan ($42.4 million), it announced. The unit does not disclose its amount of premiums or revenues, but we can find clues in other figures. Twenty-five million people used WeShare services in 2019 and the average premium amount per user was over 1,000 yuan ($151). That is, WeShare generated no more than 25 billion yuan, or $3.78 billion, in premium that year because the user figure also accounts for a good number of premium-free users.*Moving forward, it remains unclear whether Tencent will restructure its fintech operations in a more cohesive and collaborative way. As they expand, will investors and regulators demand that? And what opportunities are there for others to compete in a space dominated by two huge players?One thing is for sure: Tencent will need to tread more carefully on regulatory issues. Ant\u2019s achievement is a win for entrepreneurs looking to \u201cdisrupt\u201d China\u2019s financial sector, but its halted IPO, which is tied to regulatory issues and reportedly Jack Ma\u2019s hubris, also sounds an alarm to contenders that policymaking in China can be capricious.",

            "description": "(Bloomberg) -- With 22 pages of vaguely worded edicts, China has cast doubt on the future of its biggest internet companies and ignited a $290 billion equity selloff.Investors are now gaming out how bad it might get for Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Tencent Holdings Ltd. and other Chinese internet giants as Xi Jinping\u2019s government prepares to roll out a raft of new anti-monopoly regulations.As is almost always the case, the country\u2019s leaders have said little about how harshly they plan to clamp down or why they decided to act now. But the draft rules released Tuesday give the government wide latitude to rein in tech entrepreneurs like Jack Ma who until recently enjoyed an unusual amount of freedom to expand their empires across nearly every aspect of Chinese life.The country\u2019s internet ecosystem -- which has long been protected from competition by the likes of Google and Facebook -- is dominated by two companies, Alibaba and Tencent, through a labyrinthine network of investment that encompasses the vast majority of the country\u2019s startups in arenas from AI (SenseTime, Megvii) to fresh veggies (Meicai) and digital finance (Ant Group). Their patronage has also groomed a new generation of titans including food and travel giant Meituan and Didi Chuxing -- China\u2019s Uber. Those that prosper outside their aura, the largest being TikTok-owner ByteDance Ltd., are rare.The anti-monopoly rules now threaten to upset that status quo with a range of potential outcomes, from a benign scenario of fines to a break-up of industry leaders. While few China watchers claim to know where in that spectrum authorities will land, most view this week as a turning point.\u201cThe Wild West era of policy arbitrage -- taking advantage of weak regulations over the sector -- has come to an end,\u201d said John Dong, a securities attorney at Joint-Win Partners in Shanghai.Here are some of the scenarios analysts and investors are considering:MildOptimists say regulators are merely re-asserting their right to oversee internet companies, without trying to initiate drastic change.Story continuesEven if authorities do take action, China has a tradition of cracking down in fits and starts, or making examples out of high-profile companies. Tencent, for instance, became a prominent target of a campaign to combat gaming addiction among children in 2018. While its shares took a hit, they eventually recovered to all-time highs. Alibaba has done the same after running afoul of authorities on everything from unfairly squeezing merchants to turning a blind eye to fakes. Both companies were worth around $800 billion before shares began tanking this month.\u201cEach internet leader may face some impact and have to adjust their practices, but the regulations will unlikely affect their leadership,\u201d said Elinor Leung, an analyst at CLSA Ltd. in Hong Kong. \u201cInternet platforms, by nature, are scale businesses.\u201dRead more: What Five Alibaba Investors Are Doing With Their Plunging SharesLiu Bo, Alibaba\u2019s general manager of Tmall marketing and operations, said on the sidelines of the company\u2019s Singles\u2019 Day celebration on Wednesday that he wasn\u2019t surprised by the new rules and that the government was \u201cimproving\u201d oversight across various industries.Chinese internet stocks led by Meituan and Tencent gained at least 3% Thursday, recouping some of their two-day loss.BadSome analysts predict there\u2019s a crackdown coming, but a targeted one. They point to language in the regulations that suggests a heavy focus on online commerce, from forced exclusive arrangements with merchants known as \u201cPick One of Two\u201d to algorithm-based prices favoring new users. The regulations specifically warn against selling at below-cost to weed out rivals.Those kinds of strategies helped drive eBay Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. out of China and have led companies including Alibaba, JD.com Inc., and upstart Pinduoduo Inc. to accuse each other of using underhanded tactics.Read more: Alibaba Singles\u2019 Day Ends Strongly as Beijing Storm ApproachesAlso embedded within the rules is a reference to the need for official approval on all mergers and acquisitions involving Variable Interest Entities. The VIE model has never been formally endorsed by Beijing but has been used by tech titans such as Alibaba to list shares overseas. Under the structure, Chinese corporations transfer profits to an offshore entity with shares that foreign investors can then own. Pioneered by Sina Corp. and its investment bankers during a 2000 initial public offering, the VIE framework rests on shaky legal ground and foreign investors have been perennially nervous about their bets unwinding overnight.\u201cThe VIE structure has been operating in a gray area in China, and till this date, there\u2019s no law saying if it\u2019s illegal or not,\u201d said Zhan Hao, managing partner of Beijing-based Anjie Law Firm, who specializes in antitrust.One worry is that uncertainty surrounding the new rules will chill investment, acquisitions and venture capital funding until officials shed more light on what they\u2019re prepared to do.NightmareMost worst-case scenarios revolve around the idea that China\u2019s leaders have grown frustrated with the swagger of tech billionaires and want to teach them a lesson by breaking up their companies -- even if it means short-term pain for the economy and markets.China\u2019s private sector has maintained a delicate relationship with the Communist Party for decades, and has only recently been recognized as central to the nation\u2019s future. Many commentators have attributed the recent crackdown on fintech companies to remarks Jack Ma made at a conference in October, when he decried attempts to rein in the burgeoning field as short-sighted and outmoded.Read more: Inside the Chaotic Unraveling of Jack Ma\u2019s $35 Billion IPOBuried within the anti-monopoly rules is a paragraph brandishing vague but seemingly dire threats: Companies that violate anti-monopoly regulations may be barred from acquisitions. And if they\u2019re to be allowed to proceed, they may be forced to divest assets, share intellectual property or technologies, or open up infrastructure to competitors and adjust their algorithms.\u201cIt\u2019s highly likely that the guidelines will bring about the eventual splitting off of subsidiaries, and could result in the elimination of a lot of non-compliant smaller firms,\u201d said Dong at Joint-Win Partners. \u201cNo country in the world would allow all these to exist in one huge entity.\u201dAlibaba, Ant and Tencent alone commanded a combined market capitalization of nearly $2 trillion before last week, easily surpassing state-owned behemoths like Bank of China Ltd. as the country\u2019s most valuable companies.Alibaba and Tencent are also key backers of leaders in adjacent industries, such as Wang Xing\u2019s food delivery giant Meituan and car-hailing leader Didi. They\u2019ve invested billions of dollars in hundreds of up-and-coming mobile and internet companies, gaining kingmaker status in the world\u2019s largest smartphone and internet market by users.\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be a shred of a doubt by now for internet companies -- never question the drive or the determination of the regulators,\u201d Dong said. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as too big to fail, not in China.\u201d(Updates with share action from the 12th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "description": "China's internet giant Tencent posted a strong set of numbers for the third quarter of its financial year, driven by robust demand for its games and communications platforms during the pandemic. According to a company statement, revenue for the three months ended September 30 were up 29% year-on-year to RMB 125.44 billion ($18.4 billion). Operating profit rose 34% to RMB 38 billion ($5.6 billion).This has been a tricky period for large technology platforms such as Tencent and rivals Alibaba, who have not only had to cope with a market recovering from plotting a pandemic recovery, but also face the prospect of increased regulation that have cast a shadow on this space. Earlier this week, a 22-page edict from regulators panicked the sector, leading to a $290 billion selloff from spooked investors.\u201cSuch regulation is not new, and it\u2019s also not unique to China,\u201d Martin Lau Tencent's president said, trying to calm frayed investors' nerves on a post-results call. \u201cAs technology companies become bigger and more important to the economy ... more regulations do reflect the new realities needed. It\u2019s not just the case for China, it\u2019s also the case globally.\u201dTencent's Value-Added Services business\u2014including gaming\u2014posted a strong 38% growth in revenue to RMB 69.8 billion (US$10.5 billion). Online game revenues grew 45%, while social-network revenues increased 29% after the consolidation of game-streaming giant Huya. Honour of Kings exceeded 100 million average daily active users for the first 10 months of 2020.\"This quarter marked the second anniversary of our strategic organisation upgrade, which was intended to enhance our strength in consumer internet and extend our presence to industrial internet,\" Ma Huateng, chairman and CEO of Tencent, said in a statement. \"While the upgrade was designed to bear fruit over the longer run, we are already seeing initial benefits in areas such as consolidating our advertising services, rejuvenating our product and content platforms, growing our cloud and SaaS businesses and building an internal open source code base.\"Meanwhile, revenues from online advertising increased by 16% to RMB 21.35 billion (US$3.2 billion) for the third quarter of 2020 on a year-on-year basis, boosted by wider adoption of its algorithmic advertisement buying solutions, as well as demand growth from categories such as education, internet services and ecommerce, Also, social and other advertising revenues grew by 21% to RMB 17.75 billion (US$2.68 billion), driven by higher revenues flowing from Weixin Moments. However, growth of new users appeared to be slowing for the combination of Wechat and Weixin, with monthly user addition growth at just 0.6% quarter-on-quarter and 5.6% year-on-year.Away from the headlights of the gaming business, Tencent's fintech and cloud computing businesses continued to display strong growth.

            "description": "Chinese internet giant Tencent said Thursday its revenue climbed 29 percent in the third quarter of this year, spurred by gaming and advertising as coronavirus lockdowns keep users indoors and online.The Shenzhen-based parent company of WeChat said revenues rose to RMB 125.4 billion ($18.9 billion) year-on-year while net profit increased to RMB 38.5 billion in the third quarter.It hailed revenue growth in smartphone games, including the latest instalment of its battle arena game League of Legends.Third quarter revenue from fintech and business services increased by 24 percent to RMB 33.2 billion year-on-year due to higher revenues from commercial payment and wealth management, it said.Tencent also noted that \u201coverall China advertising activity appears to have largely returned to normal\u201d, after months of stringent lockdown measures imposed to combat the virus.But the better-than-expected results came as Chinese regulators cast gloom over the biggest e-commerce stretch of the year by announcing draft antitrust rules that signal a possible crackdown on high-flying internet giants.Regulators in Shanghai and Hong Kong earlier this month halted the enormous IPO of fintech giant Ant Group, whose parent company Alibaba is Tencent\u2019s rival.According to Bloomberg, Tencent executives will hold a conference call seeking to reinforce perceptions that Tencent \u201cisn\u2019t in the same boat as\u201d Ant.Tencent\u2019s messaging platform WeChat also faced challenges in operating in the United States where it has around 19 million active daily users.The Trump administration had ordered a ban on WeChat downloads which was later blocked by a US judge.While many companies are being hammered by the economic fallout of the pandemic, tech firms worldwide including Apple and Amazon have seen strong demand for their products.Tencent\u2019s stock price was 4.72 percent in Hong Kong at the close, before the earnings were released.",

            "description": "Tencent (TCEHY -0.22%) and JD.com (JD -0.64%) were both standout performers in the crowded Chinese tech sector this year.Tencent's stock rallied nearly 70% as it impressed investors with the robust growth of its advertising, social networking, gaming, and fintech businesses. JD's stock soared 160% as its e-commerce revenues surged.Tencent and JD are already joined at the hip. Tencent owns a 17.1% stake in JD, and JD operates online stores within Tencent's WeChat. Both companies consider Alibaba (BABA -1.02%) to be a mutual adversary.Does either Chinese tech giant still have room to run over the next year? Let's compare their business models, growth rates, and valuations to find out.Tencent: A jack of all tradesTencent is the world's largest video game publisher. Its online gaming revenue accounted for a third of its top line last quarter, and it publishes hit games like League of Legends, Honor of Kings, and PUBG Mobile.Its owns WeChat, the largest mobile messaging platform in China with over 1.2 billion monthly active users (MAUs), and its older counterpart QQ, which served 648 million mobile MAUs last quarter. WeChat hosts millions of third-party Mini Programs, which allow users to buy products, hail rides, pay bills, order food, and more without ever leaving the app.Tencent also owns Tencent Video, one of the largest video streaming platforms in China, and a big stake in Tencent Music, the country's top streaming music platform.Tencent sells ads across that sprawling ecosystem, and its online ad revenue accounted for 16% of its revenue last quarter. Another 23% came from value-added services, including subscriptions, across those platforms.Tencent's fintech and business services unit -- which generated 26% of its revenue last quarter -- hosts WeChat Pay, which holds a near-duopoly in China's digital payments market with Ant Group's Alipay; and Tencent Cloud, the second-largest cloud platform in China after Alibaba Cloud.JD.com: The anti-AlibabaJD is often compared to Alibaba, but the two companies operate completely different business models. Alibaba operates paid listing platforms, doesn't take on inventories, and fulfills orders with its Cainiao subsidiary.JD is a direct retailer that takes on inventories and fulfills its orders via a first-party logistics network. Therefore, JD is actually China's top direct retailer by annual revenue, while Alibaba owns the country's top e-commerce marketplaces.JD's approach allows it to maintain tighter control over its products and prevent counterfeit products from tainting its marketplaces. Its JD Logistics network, which was expanded through years of investments, has become one of the most advanced delivery platforms in China, with automated warehouse robots, delivery drones, and driverless delivery vehicles.In addition to Tencent, JD's top investors include Walmart, which operates an online grocery joint venture with the company, and Alphabet's Google, which integrates JD's marketplace into Google Shopping.JD's sales usually accelerate during three major shopping periods throughout the year: Chinese New Year in January or February, the 618 Grand Promotion, which commemorates its own anniversary in the first half of June, and the Singles Day shopping day on Nov. 11.Which company is growing faster?Tencent's revenue rose 28% year-over-year in the first half of 2020, led by double-digit growth across all its core businesses. The COVID-19 crisis boosted its gaming and value-added service revenue as more people stayed at home, and a shift to remote work lifted its cloud revenue.Its online advertising business also remained surprisingly resilient, as higher spending from e-commerce, gaming, and online education companies during the crisis offset its loss of ad revenue from pandemic-stricken industries. Its adjusted profit, which excludes its investments in other companies, rose 29%.Analysts expect Tencent's revenue and earnings to rise 33% and 21%, respectively, this year. Based on those estimates, Tencent's stock seems reasonably valued at 44 times this year's earnings.JD's revenue also rose 28% year-over-year in the first half of 2020. Its revenue surged 34% in the second quarter, marking its strongest growth in ten quarters, as this year's 618 Grand Promotion benefited from pent-up demand during the pandemic and an aggressive expansion into lower-tier cities.JD's annual active customers grew 30% year-over-year to 417.4 million during the second quarter, and over 80% of its new customers came from lower-tier cities.Its net income per ADS more than doubled year-over-year in the first half of 2020, thanks to robust sales of higher-margin products, the increased scale of its logistics network, and tighter cost controls.Analysts expect JD's revenue and earnings to rise 33% and 51%, respectively, for the full year. Its stock trades at nearly 60 times this year's earnings, but that's a fairly reasonable valuation relative to its growth rate.The better buy: JD.comI own both Tencent and JD, but Tencent's lower growth rates and its mixed exposure to volatile markets like online games, ads, fintech, and cloud computing make it a slightly less attractive stock than JD right now. Meanwhile, JD's accelerating growth, its simpler business model, its superior scale, and its growing presence in lower-tier cities all make it a more compelling growth stock than Tencent.",

REUTERS/Tingshu Wang Acquire Licensing RightsHONG KONG (Reuters) - China's Laobaixing <603883.SS> and Yixintang Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd <002727.SZ> are in advanced talks to create the country's biggest drugstore chain via a share swap, three people familiar with the matter said.Laobaixing's founders, Xie Zilong and Chen Xiulan, are expected to have a bigger stake in the merged firm than Yixintang's founder Ruan Hongxian, said two of the people.Shanghai-listed Laobaixing, formally known as LBX Pharmacy Chain Joint Stock Company and which boasts Tencent Holdings Ltd <0700.HK> as a backer, has a market value of around $4.4 billion (3.4 billion pounds), while Shenzhen-listed Yixintang is valued at about $3.5 billion.The talks have been ongoing for more than three months, the two people said. One person said the firms are aiming to finalise the deal in the coming days, adding that Laobaixing would remain the listed entity.After the story was published, Yixintang said in a filing late on Monday that the report about the company being in talks with Laobaixing to create China's largest pharmacy chain was untrue. Yixintang has nothing to disclose at this stage, it said in the filing.Laobaixing did not respond to requests for comment.The sources declined to be identified as the discussions were not public.Shares in both firms initially climbed on the news of the merger talks but later gave up gains to be mostly flat in afternoon trade.Tencent, which took a 1% stake in Laobaixing to become a strategic partner this year, has endorsed the merger and is planning to work with the combined firm to speed up implementation of a \"smart retail\" strategy, according to two people.The tech giant is looking at helping with the integration of their online and physical store businesses and will help drive traffic through its messaging service WeChat as well as other platforms, said one person.Tencent declined to comment.Laobaixing, also backed by private equity firms FountainVest Partners and Primavera Capital, had 6.7 billion yuan ($1 billion) in revenue for the first half of the year, while Yixintang had 6 billion yuan, filings show.Together they exceeded the 8.6 billion yuan in first-half sales for current industry leader, state-backed Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores. Their combined number of stores at around 13,100 would also be more than double Guoda's.China's drugstore market is, however, highly fragmented. According to market research firm Qianzhan, Guoda had a market share of 2.9% last year, ahead of Laobaixing with 2.6% and Yixintang with 2.4%.Both Laobaixing and Yixintang sell pharmaceuticals, traditional Chinese medicine, nutritional supplements and medical equipment. They also complement each other geographically with Laobaixing strong in central and eastern China while Yixintang has focused on the southwest of China, particularly its home province of Yunnan.Laobaixing, established in 2001, is 33% held by its founders. For years it counted EQT as a key backer but the Swedish private equity firm sold its 25% stake to FountainVest and Primavera for $557 million a year ago.Yixintang, founded in 1981, is 31% owned by founder Ruan.Reporting by Julie Zhu; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Susan FentonOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

The company also promised to buy them back at ten times their original price of RMB 10 (USD 1.5), according to its Weibo post on Wednesday.That untimely September scandal broke just one day before Miniso filed for an initial public offering in the US.However, it apparently had little impact on the company\u2019s public offering, as Miniso raised nearly USD 700 million in its IPO.Read this: Tencent-backed variety retailer Miniso files for US IPOThe nail polish incident was not the company\u2019s first run-in with negative press. In August, Guangdong food and drug regulators revealed that Miniso\u2019s Garden perfume contained illegal materials and fined the contract manufacturer RMB 8,478 (USD 1,266) in total. In June, Shanghai regulators disclosed that Miniso\u2019s KaKao Friends RYAN\u2014 which are food bowls for kids\u2014contained above-standard levels of of melamine.\u201cIn the past, we were passive, but now we are taking the initiative to ensure good quality of our products,\u201d Ye told 36Kr.Miniso has built a huge retail network of 4,200 brick-and-mortar stores worldwide since it was set up in 2013. The company\u2019s wide variety of products including cookies, umbrellas, and hair dryers can be ordered on its app or via a mini program on Tencent\u2019s WeChat. Tencent (HKSE: 0700) is a key shareholder of Miniso.However, the company does not manufacture its own products, instead relying on suppliers, while it directly manages only 129 stores, with the rest controlled by franchisees.",

            "description": "An angelic chorus of young boys set the scene at a big Tencent press conference held last week to announce new production strategies and a huge slate of upcoming content.\u201cThe blood which fills our chest has boiled over, we must struggle for the truth! Arise, slaves, arise, we shall be the masters of the world!\u201d they warbled, singing the version of \u201cThe Internationale,\u201d the Socialist anthem, translated into Chinese from Russian in the 1920s by a poet friend of Mao Zedong.Though the song was also taken up in 1989 by the pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, it was here deployed as a segue into a half-hour presentation on one of the tech giant\u2019s biggest upcoming film projects: \u201c1921,\u201d a blockbuster about the founding of the Chinese Communist Party intended as a tribute on the 100th anniversary of the occasion.It\u2019s no surprise that despite all the uncertainties of film scheduling these days due to coronavirus-related production slowdowns and shifting global release dates, the film has already fixed a July 1, 2021 release date to debut the same day as that founding.The film will be jointly produced by Tencent Pictures and Shanghai Film Group, and directed by Fifth Generation helmer Huang Jianxin, known for co-directing with Han Sanping, the influential ex-China Film Group chairman, the two exemplars of China\u2019s nationalistic \u201cmain melody\u201d genre: propaganda flicks \u201cThe Founding of a Republic\u201d (2009) and \u201cThe Founding of an Army\u201d (2011).\u201c1921\u201d is just one of at least 21 such \u201cmain melody\u201d projects that Tencent\u2019s content arms Tencent Pictures, China Literature and New Classics Media are currently working on, which account for a huge portion of the 56 titles unveiled at the presser in Shanghai on Monday. Seven others focus on the \u201cpower of youth,\u201d 11 on \u201ceastern stories,\u201d and nine of \u201cforeign collaborations.\u201dGenerally speaking, \u201crealist themes\u201d that examine social issues will be the focus of future project development, said Tencent group VP and Tencent Pictures CEO Cheng Wu (aka Edward Cheng), noting: \u201cSuch works are close to lived experience, and so resonate emotionally more easily with audiences. Plus, as the industry\u2019s ability continuously improves, it\u2019s becoming increasingly possible to shoot high quality realistic works.\u201dOther works in the patriotic vein includes the TV series such as \u201cRenshijian,\u201d whose name roughly translates to \u201cIn the World of the People\u201d), about how the lives of common Chinese people have improved over the past 50 years; \u201cChinese Peacekeeping Force,\u201d about Chinese UN peacekeepers in Serbia; \u201cGoing Rural,\u201d about the charms of rural life; and another celebrating the 40th anniversary of the founding of China\u2019s special economic zones.Development for \u201c1921\u201d started three and a half years ago, said producer Ren Ming. The team struggled to film amidst the coronavirus pandemic, which put a wrench in plans to shoot abroad and bring in foreign actors.But the biggest challenge was a direct request from the head of the Shanghai municipal propaganda bureau, who asked them to gather 100 celebrities to appear in the 100th anniversary movie.\u201cOur first reaction was that this was an impossible task,\u201d she said, even though over a decade ago, Huang and Han had rustled up 100 stars to try to make a spectacular out of \u201cThe Founding of a Party.\u201d \u201cThere have been big changes since to our cultural and market environment. Talented actors nowadays have more options and keep very busy.\u201dHowever, the political brownie points and subsequent career boost that come from appearing in such tributes to the Communist Party \u2014 and the likely political stain of turning down such roles or never playing ball \u2014 continues to create a strong pull even for top stars.\u201cWhat surprised and really touched me was that pretty much every actor we called extremely readily accepted our invitation, and actively took great pains to clear their schedules to make it happen,\u201d said Ren. \u201cThey all said the same thing to me: \u2018I\u2019m coming because this is to celebrate the Party\u2019s 100th anniversary. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\u2019.\u201d\u201c1921\u201d features bankable young celebrities Huang Xuan (\u201cBlind Massage,\u201d \u201cYouth\u201d), Ni Ni (\u201cThe Flowers of War\u201d), Liu Haoran (\u201cMy People, My Country,\u201d \u201cDetective Chinatown 3\u201d), and TFBoy idol Wang Junkai. These are hoped to specifically appeal to Chinese youth.\u201cWe hope to fit with the film-going preferences of young people today,\u201d explained actor Zhang Chao, while fresh face Hu Xianxu explained that the team tried hard to mine the \u201crelaxed, humorous and clever sides of those young people who founded the Party.\u201dThe rhetoric of the young stars focused on inculcating modern youth with a sense of patriotic responsibility.\u201cIt feels like nowadays, when you talk about a sense of mission or of conviction, it\u2019s taken as a joke. But after shooting this film, I feel it\u2019s not a joke at all,\u201d said actor Zhang Yunlong, stating that he hoped the film would help viewers to \u201creally understand these two terms\u2019 importance and meaning.\u201dActor Yuan Wenkang said his role playing a historic intellectual who felt a patriotic duty towards nation-building taught him that \u201ca big and strong nation especially needs intellectuals to help our culture propagate outward.\u201d",

            "description": "Tencent Pictures this week stepped out alongside fellow Tencent subsidiaries New Classics Media and China Literature (aka Yuewen Media) to present for the first time a joint, collaborative film and TV production strategy.Tencent Pictures and Hong Kong-listed e-book platform China Literature were both established in 2015. Production firm New Classics Media was established in 2007 and was acquired by China Literature in 2018 for $2.25 billion. Up until now, Tencent had a tendency to pit the three against each other as competitors, and left them to undertake similar business endeavors independently without overarching coordination.But in the wake of China Literature\u2019s serious losses in the first half of the year, the company is shifting gears to think more about how they can work together more collaboratively.Tencent Group VP and Tencent Pictures CEO Cheng Wu (aka Edward Cheng) took the stage at a press conference Monday in Shanghai to describe the triumvirate as now being a \u201ctroika.\u201d He explained that they collectively lead content development for their sprawling parent company, currently one of the world\u2019s most valuable conglomerates.\u201cIn the past we were each fighting our own battles alone, but now, with coordination and different divisions of labor, we have become a troika,\u201d Cheng said.Last year, the three joined forces for the first time to adapt the popular internet novel \u201cQing Yu Nian\u201d published on China Literature into a drama series, known in English as \u201cJoy of Life\u201d \u2014 with strong results. Its 46 45-minute episodes have collectively been streamed 8.5 billion times since they first premiered on Tencent Video and iQiyi last November, according to data from Maoyan.Despite the hit, China Literature racked up $493 million (RMB3.296 billion) in losses in the first half of this year, in part because the company was slammed with more than $500 million in impairment losses related to its earlier acquisition of New Classics.In April, Cheng and other veteran Tencent execs were parachuted in to replace China Literature\u2019s founding management team as business started going south.Cheng had to grovel in the August regulatory filing, saying: \u201cThe disappointing results made us realize that the lack of resilience of our underlying business model and our structural issues have piled up over the recent years. We are prepared to adopt a new culture and creative ideas from a more strategic and multi-dimensional perspective.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt is never too late to change, and now is the time to make a change.\u201dStructural integrations have been underway. Four months ago, the Tencent animation and comics team was combined with a previously separate comics team working under China Literature, with the goal of getting them to work together on turning 100 online novels a year into comics, Cheng told Chinese media. Meanwhile, strategic working groups have been set up to standardize decision-making and share strategic information between the three subsidiariesMonday\u2019s event appeared to be the first attempt to present these changes to the public.\u201cAs early as eight or nine years ago, we had such a plan [to collaborate], which is why we first proposed the concept of \u2018pan-entertainment\u2019 [in 2011]. But having that concept was just the first step; the next step was to develop solid capabilities in each field and reserves of IP,\u201d Cheng said.The search for those IP reserves prompted Tencent in 2012 to start an online comics division \u2014 which now has a catalogue of more than 30,000 titles, 1,500 of which have over 100 million hits \u2014 and China Literature, which now hosts 8.9 million users who have written some 13.4 million works.\u201cThis foundation alone is not enough. What we want to do now is integrate these businesses together, with IP at the core,\u201d Cheng explained.The idea going forward is for Tencent Pictures to be the hub connecting the troika, with a focus on new project investment, casting and production of both films and TV works. New Classics Media will take a \u201cboutique approach\u201d and focus on TV series and the occasional movie. China Literature will focus on developing its large library of online content into film and TV IPs, including with external partners.Tencent on Monday introduced a long list of 56 ongoing projects the three companies are involved in, spanning theatrical films, \u201cinternet films\u201d headed straight to streaming, and TV projects. At least four are now joint works between the trio, including a second season of \u201cJoy of Life.\u201dCheng explained the reasoning behind Tencent\u2019s \u201cpan-entertainment model\u201d in-depth.The culture industry\u2019s biggest challenge is that good culture requires innovation, but the failure rate of innovation is extremely high, he pontificated.\u201cThere\u2019s a saying in film world about \u2018721\u2019: Out of 10 films, seven will lose money, two will break even and one will turn a profit, but the number of films that actually become profitable in China is actually less than 10%,\u201d plaguing the entire industry with \u201csystemic risk\u201d as consumers demand new content,\u201d he said.Hollywood tries to reduce this risk via \u201cindustrialization\u201d \u2013 that is, by standardizing industry practices and predictive models. But this comes at the price of reducing the space for content innovation, a cost that major directors like Alfonso Cuaron have bemoaned, he noted.The extent to which even major Hollywood studios have been battered by the coronavirus has exposed the vulnerability of only creating film and TV works without diversifying.Each medium has its own advantages and disadvantages, Cheng said. Text content is the simplest to produce, but it\u2019s hard to go viral. Comics are also easy to make and consume but have more niche appeal. Film and TV have mass appeal, but require high investment, long cycles and high risks. Games and live entertainment come with even higher risks but have long monetization cycles and strong consumer stickiness.Tencent\u2019s model is to generate IP via its literature and comics platforms, take the popular ones and turn them into film and TV projects, then take the breakout hits and make them into video games, thereby reducing risks at each step.More broadly speaking, in his assessment, China has already basically finished building up the \u201cnew infrastructure\u201d of its digital content industry \u2014 the various online streaming services and content platforms that consumers now flock to. He explained: \u201dChina\u2019s culture industry has basically achieved a modern industrial layout, and adopted a mindset [receptive to the idea of] IP-based cultural production.\u201dTo continue producing competitive works, the next step is for China to shift from merely developing \u201cgood content to [developing] a good content industry, and then a content industry industrial chain.\u201d In other words, the country needs better industry-wide systems, practices and standardizations to ensure that creators can consistently and continuously generate hits, rather than just one-off successes.China\u2019s content development to date has been plagued by investors\u2019 need for quick returns.Cheng admitted that many internally at Tencent were skeptical when the animation business started in 2012, questioning the benefits of getting involved in a business so difficult to monetize. But now, several of the company\u2019s comics are close to bearing fruit, including \u201cThe Outcast,\u201d which execs announced Monday will be adapted into a live-action feature film by director Wuershan (\u201cMojin: The Lost Legend\u201d).Though Cheng admits that doubters concerned that Tencent Pictures is \u201cprogressing too slowly\u201d have brought \u201ca lot of urgent expectations and pressure,\u201d he said the cultivation of good IP can\u2019t be rushed. After working for the first five years to establish that base, more tangible results will hopefully now start trickling in.\u201cIt\u2019s unrealistic to think about the film and TV industry via a one- or two-year cycle. It\u2019s got to be at least five years. After the next five years, we\u2019ll have more progress,\u201d he told Chinese media. \u201cAt the moment, we need to be down-to-earth, objectively assess the difficulties we may face, and be prepared to face all possible challenges.\u201d",

Can you expand on the detail behind your stated short-form video strategy? Will this involve TikTok?Ying: VSPN intends to use our world-class video production capabilities and industry insights to create different forms of content. We will give our existing fans and a wider audience a new and vivid esports experience. Kuaishou, as our investors and a strategic partner, will support in all ways as a media platform to help our content reach more users. Short-form video is an important part of our future strategy and we look forward to working with platforms all over the world in this regard.TC: What is VSPN\u2019s share of the esports market?Ying: There is no official estimation of the size of the esports market, but VSPN is by far the largest esports organization in China, with over 1,000+ employees and covering every major esports tournament you\u2019ve ever heard of. By many measures, we are the largest esports organization in the world and will continue to expand.TC: Why do you think Shanghai has become a center for esports?Ying: As the biggest and perhaps most international city in China, it has a vibrant and increasingly sophisticated economy. Tech innovation and new industries are actively encouraged to grow here.The Shanghai government has implemented supportive measures and policies to encourage the growth of esports both domestically and internationally. Thanks to these measures Shanghai has become an international hub for the biggest and best tournaments in the world.TC: How important is research into esports for VSPN and why?Ying: It is vital for VSPN. As an esports total solutions provider aiming to build a sustainable global esports ecosystem, data and R&D allows us to give our fans a richer experience.

What sort of growth do you expect in the next few years?Ying: Regardless of business lines, VSPN\u2019s core mission is to provide the best esports experiences for our fans. And these experiences include not just online viewing experiences, but also offline ones where fans physically attend. We see our offline business as a natural way to extend our services to our fans; it is an important supplement to our overall offerings. We expect to grow it per our fans\u2019 and partner\u2019s demands.TC: Mobile esports, especially the KPL and PUBG MOBILE (or Peacekeeper Elite in China), have attracted more and more female audiences. What is the future of esports among women / girls?Ying: Mobile gaming has really helped extend esports\u2019 reach to female participants and audiences. Rightfully so, we see a future of esports where female participants take a more prominent role than they have done. Not just onstage as athletes, but also off stage as fans and more importantly backstage as top quality producers and decision-makers in the industry. The impact of having more female fans, athletes and professionals is exciting and will be hugely beneficial to the wider industry.TC: What is the future of esports in augmented reality?Ying: We think esports in its full form will look and feel a lot different from what we\u2019ve seen so far in sports and entertainment. The possibility of integrating real-world gaming and virtual competitions is fascinating. VSPN is only beginning to test the boundaries of new technologies such as AR, VR. The emergence of these technologies will help us create fresher experiences, and the possibilities are endless.TC: Please tell us more about your personal history.Ying: Firstly, thank you for having me \u2014 it is a real pleasure to speak to TechCrunch and be able to announce our fundraise to the world. I have been working in the gaming and esports industry all my life and I\u2019m excited about the future. With the team at VSPN we are proud to be pioneers in the esports industry.I live between Beijing and Shanghai, but I spend a lot of my time travelling to other Chinese cities like Xi\u2019an, Chengdu, Guangzhou and Shenzhen where we have esports arenas and business interests. Usually I travel internationally to some of our overseas operations and competitions, so I look forward to that when travel becomes easier.I am a fan of traditional sports too and an avid football fan. I follow some of the European leagues \u2014 whenever I can, I go to matches to enjoy the atmosphere; I went to Stamford Bridge early this year and loved it, but seeing the AC versus Inter Derby live is hard to beat\u2026TC: Why did you get into this business and how?Ying: Mostly because I am a HUGE gaming fan! I\u2019ve been playing computer games since I was a teenager and enjoy playing all types. Earlier this year I played COD Warzone as soon as it came out and often play PUBG Mobile; I\u2019m extremely lucky to be in an industry which I\u2019ve loved since I was very young. It\u2019s a great way to connect with friends and I am proud to have worked in game development and publishing for my whole career. Five years ago, esports seemed like the obvious next step because of the competitive element. We saw the beginnings of a trend and founded VSPN with a world-class team to make that potential a reality.VSPN is very proud to be leading the world in a relatively new industry. We think esports will continue to grow exponentially and will be an incredibly important part of the entertainment industry in years to come. To lead a Chinese company with a global future is really exciting.TC: What motivates you as a businessman?Ying: Bringing new forms of entertainment to millions of people around the world and building a global business.TC: Who inspires you most in the business world?There are so many fantastic businessmen in China who are doing some really innovative things at the moment. For example, the live-streaming industry has become enormous in 2020 due to the pandemic and has offered entrepreneurs a new way to sell products and engage with new audiences.If I had to name one it would be Mark Ren (COO at Tencent Holdings) \u2014 he is an exceptional businessman. The way he has helped create sustainable ecosystems in the entertainment space and captured trends is something every businessman should aspire to. This is something VSPN works hard at and we are very proud to be such close partners of Tencent.TC: What is your opinion of Silicon Valley?Ying: It\u2019s an amazing place and has shown the world how technology can improve lives all over the world. For many years it has led the world as a centre for creativity and innovation and continues to be an inspiration to entrepreneurs around the world. In China, we have lots of Silicon Valleys!TC: Is there anything else you\u2019d like to say to TechCrunch readers?Ying: This has been a challenging year for many businesses and the esports industry has had to adapt, but I think the world has seen how big esports is and how it can bring communities and cultures together.

            "description": "FILE PHOTO: The messenger app WeChat is seen next to its logo in this illustration picture taken August 7, 2020. REUTERS/Florence Lo/Illustration/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights(Reuters) - A U.S. judge in San Francisco on Friday rejected a Justice Department request to reverse a decision that allowed Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google to continue to offer Chinese-owned WeChat for download in U.S. app stores.U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler said the government's new evidence did not change her opinion about the Tencent app. As it has with Chinese video app TikTok, the Justice Department has argued WeChat threatens national security.WeChat has an average of 19 million daily active users in the United States. It is popular among Chinese students, Americans living in China and some Americans who have personal or business relationships in China.WeChat is an all-in-one mobile app that combines services similar to Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Venmo. The app is an essential part of daily life for many in China and boasts more than 1 billion users.The Justice Department has appealed Beeler's decision permitting the continued use of the Chinese mobile app to the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, but no ruling is likely before December.In a suit brought by WeChat users, Beeler last month blocked a U.S. Commerce Department order set to take effect on Sept. 20 that would have required the app to be removed from U.S. app stores.The Commerce Department order would also bar other U.S. transactions with WeChat, potentially making the app unusable in the United States. [nL2N2GH049]\"The record does not support the conclusion that the government has 'narrowly tailored' the prohibited transactions to protect its national-security interests,\" Beeler wrote on Friday.She said the evidence \"supports the conclusion that the restrictions 'burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government\u2019s legitimate interests.'\"WeChat users argued the government sought \"an unprecedented ban of an entire medium of communication\" and offered only \"speculation\" of harm from Americans\u2019 use of WeChat.In a similar case, a U.S. appeals court agreed to fast-track a government appeal of a ruling blocking the government from banning new downloads from U.S. app stores of Chinese-owned short video-sharing app TikTok.Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Chris Reese and Cynthia OstermanOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

The ban came after India banned TikTok and dozens of other popular Chinese apps in late June.These apps were \u201cprejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order,\u201d the country\u2019s IT Ministry said on both the instances.But unlike other affected apps that became unavailable within days \u2014 if not hours \u2014 PUBG Mobile apps remained accessible in the country for users who already had them installed on their phones, tablets and PCs. In fact, according to one popular mobile insight firm, PUBG Mobile had retained more than 90% of its monthly active users in the country, a mobile-first market where 99% of smartphones run Android, in the weeks following New Delhi\u2019s order.(Following the ban, Google and Apple pulled PUBG Mobile apps from their app stores in India. But soon enough, guides on how to work around the ban and obtain and install the apps became popular on several forums.)PUBG Mobile had about 50 million monthly active users in India, tens of millions of users ahead of Call of Duty: Mobile and Fortnite and any other mobile game in the country.\u201cPUBG Mobile kickstarted an entire ecosystem \u2014 from esports organisations to teams and even a cottage industry of streamers that made the most of its spectator sport-friendly gameplay,\u201d said Rishi Alwani, a long-time analyst of Indian gaming market and publisher of news outlet The Mako Reactor.\u201cGranted Tencent did a lot of the heavy lifting in building it out, but the game\u2019s quality itself was heads and shoulders above what most Indians were used to on smartphones.

            "description": "SINGAPORE (BLOOMBERG) - Tencent Holdings has chosen a co-working space for its first office in Singapore, joining other Chinese tech giants in using the city state for a launching pad into the rest of Asia.The WeChat owner will have almost 200 seats at JustCo's co-working space in OCBC Centre East at Raffles Place, according to people familiar with the plans, who asked not to be named because the matter is private. The space amounts to 10,000 sq ft.The lease runs for one year, giving China's largest social media and video-gaming company flexibility to seek a larger space as it adds staff, the people said. Tencent said in September that it would open an office in Singapore.Representatives for Tencent and JustCo didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.The deal paves the way for Tencent to make Singapore its beachhead for a push into South-east Asia. Bytedance, the owner of popular video app TikTok, is also expanding its office space in the city-state, while Alibaba Group Holding earlier this year bought a 50 per cent stake in a Singapore office tower.The demand from Chinese tech firms could also boost Singapore's office market, which has been battered by the coronavirus pandemic, with some companies vacating leases and landlords forced to cut rents. Tech firms have taken up 350,000 sq ft of office space in new leases and expansions this year, and that could rise to 400,000 to 500,000 sq ft next year, Cushman & Wakefield estimates.Singapore is seen as an attractive base as it provides a gateway to South-east Asia's 650 million smartphone-savvy population. It also offers relative political stability and developed financial and legal systems.China's tech giants are increasingly turning their attention to the region amid growing hostility from the US and India. The Trump administration wants to remove WeChat from mobile app stores in the US and impose other restrictions, though a court has blocked the move. India has barred the company's hit games \"PUBG Mobile\" and \"Arena of Valor.\"Choosing a co-working space gives companies \"the advantage to be flexible in markets where headcount growth is unclear and there is a possibility that business can grow so quickly that they run out of space\", said Ms Christine Li, head of research and business development services for South-east Asia at Cushman. It's a common strategy for tech firms entering a new market, with Alibaba and Facebook having done so when they started in Singapore.",

            "description": "Chinese consumers use super apps such as WeChat and Tiktok less for social media and more for mobile payments and various service bookings, according to Kagan's 2020 Asia Consumer Insights survey.WeChat and Tiktok are among a growing roster of mobile apps in China and the rest of Asia-Pacific that brand themselves as \"super apps.\" While there is no widely agreed-upon definition of what a super app is, we define it as a single app that allows users to do multiple, often seemingly unrelated functions without leaving the app.Click here for a discussion on super apps in China and the rest of Asia-Pacific.We asked 1,000 Chinese adult internet users about eight popular super apps in our survey in June. At the top of the list were Tencent Holdings Ltd.'s WeChat (reportedly used by 97% of respondents) and Ant Group Co. Ltd.'s Alipay (95%). Although WeChat started as a messaging app, its in-app payment platform WeChat Pay is a direct competitor to Alipay, which is essentially a payment app.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.'s e-commerce app Taobao came third (84%), followed by Tencent's other messaging app, Tencent QQ (69%). Baidu Inc.'s search engine app (66%) has also become a super app together with an ecosystem of related apps for various functions, such as Baidu Maps and Baidu Translate. Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent form China's tech trio dubbed \"BAT.\"ByteDance had two super apps in our list: video-sharing platform Douyin, more commonly known as Tiktok (65%) and news and information app Jinri Toutiao (49%). Food delivery app Meituan by Meituan Dianping ranked last (39%).WeChat and Alipay covered almost all respondents in our survey, which means that their user bases are basically the same. To be precise, 94% of our respondents reported using both super apps. This also means that the user bases of each of the other six super apps are subsets of WeChat and Alipay's overlapping user base.Click here for adoption rates, smartphone ownership, activities and demographic profile per Chinese super app in Excel format (for clients only).In our super apps briefer last year, we identified two crucial elements employed by successful super apps in China: mobile payment systems and mini-programs.Among the eight super apps we studied, Alipay was the only one to initially start as a payment platform. Alibaba originally created Alipay as the proprietary payment system for Taobao in October 2003 until it was spun off as a separate service through its affiliate Ant Group in February 2004.Tencent ventured into the payments scene in August 2013 with the launch of WeChat Pay. Similar to Ant Financial, having its own payment system allowed Tencent to ink partnerships with various companies to accelerate market adoption of its app. Although other companies have also launched their own digital wallets and payment platforms, WeChat Pay and Alipay dominate China's mobile payments scene.Click here for an in-depth analysis of China's mobile payment systems.WeChat, however, started truly becoming the super app it is today in January 2017 when Tencent introduced mini-programs. These \"apps within an app\" can be launched from WeChat's own app drawer, allowing users to access third-party services without leaving WeChat or even downloading separate apps. By allowing third-party companies to create their own mini-programs, Tencent was able to rapidly scale up the use cases of its app without directly venturing into other lines of business.Tencent's strategy of combining mobile payment with mini-programs to \"lock\" users within the app while generating additional revenue streams became the standard playbook for other companies aspiring to launch their own super apps. Ant Group quickly adopted mini-programs in Alipay in August 2018 and so did Baidu in July 2018.ByteDance took a different route, launching mini-programs first through Tiktok in October 2018 and Jinri Toutiao in November 2018 while riding on the popularity of more established payment providers. In September, ByteDance acquired Wuhan Hezhong Yibao Technology Co. Ltd.'s UIPay, possibly to provide Tiktok and Jinri Toutiao their own payment system.The top activities in super apps that emerged in our survey support our argument about the key role of mobile payments and mini-programs in the success of Chinese super apps.An overwhelming 87% of respondents reported using super apps to do mobile payments, while 78% said they booked miscellaneous services through super apps. Services such as grooming, pet walking and medical appointments are mostly booked through mini-programs, so this activity can be a proxy for the use of third-party mini-apps.These figures are greater than those for activities related to the main services of the eight super apps we surveyed, such as social media (65%), video streaming (62%), messaging (60%) and online shopping (50%). For instance, only 61% and 66% of WeChat users reported using the app for messaging and social media, respectively, but 89% reported using WeChat for mobile payments. Even for Tiktok users, 92% reported doing mobile payments versus only 74% for social media and 71% for video streaming.Peer-to-peer mobile money transfer among super app users was also prominent among all respondents (58%). Other financial activities such as purchasing insurance (11%) and loan applications (4%) were less popular.One interesting use case that popped up in our survey was electronic identification (66%). Since Chinese law requires users to register with some of these platforms using a national ID, their super app accounts can act as proxy electronic IDs. The Chinese government took advantage of this during the COVID-19 pandemic when it required the use of health-based color-coded WeChat QR codes to control the movement of people.Super app activities appeared to vary depending on the number of super apps used. On average, Chinese consumers used 5.71 super apps with a standard deviation of 0.31. The distribution of the number of super apps used by our respondents is negatively skewed, which means that people are more likely to use more super apps that just a few. Respondents who used only one or two super apps in our list reported higher activity rates for basic communication and entertainment services: calls, text and video. Mobile payment was the top activity for users of three or more super apps.The mean age of all super app users was around 42.49 years with a standard deviation of 14.20 years. Segmenting the respondents into age groups revealed that Tencent QQ had the highest proportion of users aged 18 to 29 years (29%), which explains why its mean age of 40.74 years was the lowest among the eight super apps. In contrast, Jinri Toutiao had fewer users in the same age cohort (18%) but more in the older age brackets, pushing its mean age to become the highest at 44.61 years.Super app users reported an average monthly household income of 24,567 yuan. Taobao had the lowest mean income of 23,672 yuan, perhaps due to its mass-market appeal. Meituan, on the other hand, had the highest mean income of 29,253 yuan.Data presented in this article was collected from the Kagan 2020 Consumer Insights survey in China.

Tencent has been considering the shift of some business operations \u2014 including international game publishing \u2014 out of its home country, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations.China\u2019s tech behemoths are increasingly turning to Southeast Asia in the face of growing hostility from the US and other major markets, setting up the region \u2014 with its 650 million increasingly smartphone-savvy population \u2014 as a key battleground. President Donald Trump has banned US entities from dealing with Tencent\u2019s super-app WeChat from Sept 20, while the company\u2019s hit games PUBG Mobile and Arena of Valor are banned in India.AdvertisementTencent said in a statement that it will open a new office in Singapore to \u201csupport our growing business in Southeast Asia and beyond,\u201d in addition to current ones in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. It\u2019s recruiting for various positions including tech and business development, the company said, without offering details. Tencent currently has dozens of job openings in Singapore for businesses including cross-border commerce, cloud computing and esports, according to its hiring site.Singapore in particular is attracting attention as a regional base for both Western and Chinese corporations because of its advanced financial and legal system, and as Beijing tightens its grip on the city of Hong Kong. The city-state of under 6 million people has been careful not to take sides in the standoff between the world\u2019s two superpowers, with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong pledging last year to remain \u201cgood friends\u201d with both the US and China.TikTok\u2019s owner ByteDance is planning to spend several billion dollars and add hundreds of jobs in Singapore over the next three years, Bloomberg News reported last week. It has also applied for a digital-bank license from the city-state\u2019s central bank, alongside Alibaba-backed Ant Group and Tencent-backed Sea Ltd.Alibaba has splashed out $4 billion to take full control of Singapore-based regional e-commerce platform Lazada, which aims to serve 300 million people in Southeast Asia by 2030. In May, Alibaba struck a deal to buy half of Singapore\u2019s AXA Tower, valued at around $1.2 billion, underscoring its ambition to expand in the market. China\u2019s largest corporation is in talks to invest $3 billion into Singapore-based ride-hailing giant Grab Holdings Inc, Bloomberg News reported on Monday.AdvertisementTencent thus far has had a smaller footprint in Southeast Asia. The online entertainment juggernaut is largely run from its Shenzhen headquarters, though some global products in areas like music and video streaming operate in Hong Kong, where President Martin Lau is based. The company says it stores some user data in Singapore.In recent years, Tencent has ratcheted up efforts to expand globally as the Chinese market saturates and stricter regulatory controls on gaming slow down domestic growth. Tapping into popular franchises from investees like Activision Blizzard Inc and turning them into mobile hits marked its biggest global successes so far. In 2019\u2019s final quarter, international titles like Call of Duty Mobile and PUBG Mobile accounted for 23% of Tencent\u2019s $17 billion gaming empire, according to the company.In spite of Tencent\u2019s best efforts, however, geopolitical frictions are still likely to hinder its international expansion push. South Korea\u2019s PUBG Corp has withdrawn the Chinese company\u2019s publishing rights for PUBG Mobile in India, after the country banned the popular mobile shooter alongside more than a hundred Chinese-made apps amid border clashes. Trump\u2019s Aug 6 executive order, meanwhile, prohibits unspecified transactions with WeChat and its operator Tencent, and the Commerce Department has yet to determine whether gaming activities will be banned by Sept 20.",

The consortium, which is led by Tencent and includes Tencent Music Entertainment and other financial coinvestors, has the option to acquire, on the same valuation basis, up to an additional 10% of the share capital of UMG until January 15, 2021.

REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo Acquire Licensing RightsHONG KONG (Reuters) - Ant Group's $35 billion initial public offering (IPO) is unlikely to suffer from any U.S. restrictions on the Chinese financial technology giant due to its very limited overseas presence, potential investors and analysts said.Trump administration officials are considering curbs on Ant, an affiliate of Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba , and Tencent <0700.HK> over concerns their payment platforms threaten national security, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday.If implemented, the restrictions would illustrate how Trump's administration is seeking to prevent Chinese companies from embedding themselves in the U.S. financial system before they become a significant competitive threat.Ant said it was not aware of any discussions within the administration about restrictions. Tencent and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Ant is working towards a dual-listing in Shanghai and Hong Kong possibly as soon as this month in what sources have said could be the world's largest IPO, surpassing oil giant Saudi Aramco's <2222.SE> $29.4 billion float in December.Ant's Alipay and Tencent's WeChat payment platforms are used primarily by Chinese citizens with accounts in renminbi. Most of their U.S. interactions are with merchants accepting payments from Chinese travelers and businesses in the country.\"Basically the overseas revenue accounts for maybe 5% or less for Ant Group. That means for the U.S. revenue contribution it would be even less than that,\" said Morningstar senior equity analyst Chelsey Tam.\"I'm sure investors will ask about it during the roadshow but it's quite easy for investors to understand that if Alipay and Wechat Pay go overseas the U.S. is probably not the top priority,\" Tam said.Ant, which makes 95% of its revenue in China, is seeking to raise about $35 billion in an IPO after assessing early investor interest and based on a valuation of about $250 billion or more, Reuters has reported.The United States has increasingly scrutinized app developers over the personal data they handle, especially if some of it involves U.S. military or intelligence personnel.In 2018, the government's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) forced Ant to scrap plans to buy here MoneyGram International Inc over concerns about the safety of data that could identify U.S. citizens.It was one of the first high profile US-China deals to be blocked under the Trump administration.An official at a state-backed Chinese fund, a potential investor in an Ant IPO, said he was not worried about the planned U.S. restrictions as the market only accounted for a tiny portion of the company's overall business.The official declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.\"The ban is more about stopping Ant from expanding in the U.S. in the future, but that shouldn't have an immediate impact on the valuation as there is lot more growth left for Ant in China,\" said LightStream Research analyst Supun Walpola, who publishes on the Smartkarma platform.Reporting by Scott Murdoch and Julie Zhu; Additional reporting by Kane Wu; Writing by Sumeet Chatterjee; Editing by David Clarke and Patrick GrahamOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

            "description": "Huya (NYSE: HUYA) and Douyu (NASDAQ:DOYU), the two top players in the Chinese gaming livestreaming sector, have agreed to a blockbuster merger after a half-decade of rivalry, cementing the dominance of Tencent\u2014a shareholder for both companies\u2014in the lucrative gaming industry, as ByteDance grows in the field on the back of its popular short video apps.The merger, which is expected to close during the first half of 2021, will see Douyu delist from Nasdaq after Huya buys all of its outstanding shares via a stock-for-stock deal, according to Monday\u2019s announcement from two firms.Huya and Douyu shareholders will each wind up with 50% of the combined company. Dong Rongjie, the current Huya CEO, and Chen Shaojie, Douyu\u2019s CEO, will be co-CEOs of the new combined company.Tencent will integrate its own e-sports livestreaming brand, Penguin, with the new business after the merger, valuing it at USD 500 million. Tencent will have a voting power of 67.5% in the new entity. Linen Investment Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tencent, will purchase 1,970,804 Class B ordinary shares of Huya from Dong and his affiliates, and purchase 3,703,704 Douyu shares from Chen and his affiliates. The merged entity will have more than 80% of the market share in China\u2019s livestreaming industry.More details about the Huya and Douyu\u2019s business adjustments have yet to be disclosed. According to local media outlet Tech Planet, there will probably be a new brand named \u201cHusha\u201d, which is a combination of Huya and Douyu literally meaning \u201cTiger Shark\u201d (Huya translates as \u201cTiger Teeth\u201d and Douyu is \u201cFighting Fish\u201d).Tencent navigates the dealChinese gaming and social powerhouse Tencent has been a long-time investor in both Huya and Douyu, which are considered important platforms the giant relies on to distribute its new releases and keep gamers engaged. But the infighting between Huya and Douyu gave it headaches\u2014they battled for top broadcasters as well as exclusive broadcasting rights of e-sports game for staggeringly high prices and had been locked in talent contract lawsuits and defamation suits.\u201cThe direct result is that broadcasters\u2019 salaries will be cut and the two won\u2019t compete for broadcasting rights,\u201d said an anonymous Huya employee. \u201cIn the long term, Tencent will connect every dot in the industry from game release, e-sports, to livestreaming,\u201d she said.\u201cThis helps creates a healthier industry environment,\u201d said a gaming livstreaming manager at a Chinese top multi-channel network (MCN). \u201cWhen Panda TV was high-flying, the valuation of streamers were over-hyped,\u201d she said. Panda TV is a similar livestreaming platform, founded by Wang Sicong, son of Chinese billionaire businessman Wang Jianlin in 2015. However, it failed to succeed amid heavy competition in 2019.But she thinks that the tension between Douyu and Huya won\u2019t just disappear overnight as the merger goes ahead.Wuhan-based Douyu was founded in 2014 and went public in July 2019. Tencent invested in Douyu in 2015 and continued to inject capital in the company ever since. By the end of March, 2020, Tencent had been the biggest shareholder of Douyu with a stake of 38%.Over at Huya, a spin-off of entertainment giant YY Inc, Tencent poured USD 461.6 million before its listing on NYSE in May, 2018. In April 2020, Tencent became the controller of Huya with a voting power of 50.1%.This year, both companies saw a boost from the pandemic, as people were homebound.Douyu\u2019s revenues in the second quarter increased by 33.9% year-on-year (YoY) to RMB 2.5 billion (USD 354.4 million) and average monthly active users (MAUs) in the reported quarter were 165.3 million, of which 7.6 million were paying. During the same period, Huya generated RMB 2.7 billion (USD 381.8 million) in revenue, up 34.2% YoY. It reported 168.5 million MAUs and 6.2 million paying users.Tencent reportedly minted a unit, which fell under Tencent\u2019s gaming arm Interactive Entertainment Group (IEG), to manage Douyu, Huya, and Penguin, in a bid to achieve more synergy, last March.In August, it pushed forward the combination of the two with a preliminary non-binding proposal letter.Fending off ByteDance in gamingThe marriage of Douyu and Huya comes at a time when short video apps Douyin and Kuaishou, also video platform Bilibili are beefing up their offerings in e-sports.Per data from local research firm iResearch, China\u2019s game-streaming market is estimated to generate USD 3.5 billion in revenue this year.Douyin, the China version of TikTok, claimed to have 600 million daily active users (DAUs) in September, and its owner ByteDance is reportedly developing its own games, ranging from super casual ones to heavy games. Kuaishou reported 51 million DAUs in gaming-centric livestreaming in December 2019, and the number rose rapidly to 220 million this August. Bilibili, a video platform immensely popular among Gen Z and also a publisher itself, also expressed ambitions in gaming livestreaming. It reportedly spent RMB 800 million (USD 113 million) on a three-year exclusive agreement to broadcast the Riot Games\u2019 League of Legends (LoL) World Championship in China. Notably, Kuaishou and Bilibili are also Tencent\u2019s investees.\u201cDouyu and Huya still own a batch of top streamers who garner a majority of viewers,\u201d said the aforementioned Huya employee. \u201cBut platforms like Kuaishou and Bilibili have more videos, either short or longer ones, aside from livestreaming, which can keep viewers staying longer,\u201d she said.\u201cWhen it comes to the style, content on other platforms are more entertaining, sometimes focusing on the storytelling of a game. Streamers on Douyu and Huya are more professional players, highlighting the skills and techniques,\u201d the MCN manager said. Her team also distributes content on Douyin, where she finds quite difficult to operate accounts.\u201cGaming content easily gets banned on Douyin due to the copyright issues,\u201d she told KrASIA. Compared to platforms backed by Tencent, which is the biggest game publisher and copyright owner in China, Douyin lacks the resources, although ByteDance has entered the arena aggressively.",

            "description": "Hong Kong CNN Business \u2014Apple (AAPL) has a solution for home screen clutter: Mini apps.Instead of downloading an app, you can pull up just one part of it, saving valuable space on your phone. In China, that has long been the norm.Last month, the iPhone maker debuted \u201cApp Clips\u201d as part of its latest operating system update. The new iOS 14, which has already rolled out on many current Apple devices, will almost certainly be featured on a slate of new phones the company is revealing Tuesday.The feature lets people launch just part of an app to complete quick, on-the-go tasks, such as ordering takeout from a restaurant or renting a bike. That means instead of downloading an entirely new app, users can launch a snippet by scanning a QR code, or by tapping a link shared via text or the Safari web browser.For some, the concept may sound familiar: In China, the ubiquitous app WeChat has offered something similar for years.WeChat, which is run by Chinese internet giant Tencent, is often referred to as a \u201csuper-app,\u201d acting as a one-stop shop that does it all for users. People often joke that it more closely resembles an operating system than it does a traditional app because of how much time people spend on it. In recent years, WeChat has increasingly built its success on an ecosystem of lite apps, which are known as \u201cmini programs.\u201dMore than 400 million users rely on WeChat\u2019s one million mini programs daily to do virtually everything, from ordering groceries to booking a yoga class to paying bills, without leaving the app. Like App Clips, mini programs don\u2019t take up a lot of space, so they can load quickly and minimize the storage needed on a phone. Each program takes up 10 megabytes or less, while a full-sized app typically takes up dozens or even hundreds of megabytes.\u201cI think everyone can see the similarities [between the Apple and WeChat systems],\u201d said Xiaofeng Wang, a senior analyst at research firm Forrester. \u201cIn terms of consumer-facing digital innovations, China is definitely ahead.\u201dApple and Tencent declined to comment for this story.How the trend startedTencent introduced mini programs on January 9, 2017, exactly 10 years after the first iPhone was unveiled.Some thought the launch was intended to send a message about how the Chinese company wanted to own the future of mobile technology, according to Thibault Genaitay, a former software developer who now heads China operations at Le Wagon, a coding bootcamp.\u201cTen years after the launch of iPhone, WeChat Mini Programs officially launches. And what a change to the idea of \u2018downloading\u2019 apps,\u201d Connie Chan, a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, wrote on Twitter at the time. \u201cMini programs could be revolutionary.\u201dChan discussed the parallels between Apple and Tencent earlier this year, saying on a company podcast that \u201cApp Clips are very, very similar to the mini program ecosystem that WeChat launched.\u201dA Chinese customer using his phone to pay via a QR code with the WeChat app at a market in September in Beijing. Kevin Frayer/Getty ImagesThe two tech giants are not the only players to experiment with the idea.Over the years, other companies have floated similar initiatives, such as Google (GOOGL)\u2019s \u201cInstant Apps,\u201d Snapchat (SNAP)\u2019s \u201cSnap Minis,\u201d and Button, a New York startup that connects users to specific pages within apps.But Tencent was the first to make it mainstream, which led other Chinese platforms to follow suit, according to analysts.App fatigueThe main problem these smaller programs address is that most users no longer want to install new apps, according to Dan Frommer, former editor-in-chief at Recode and founder of tech publication The New Consumer.\u201cWe\u2019re 12 years into the App Store, and most companies \u2014 especially the big companies \u2014 all have apps,\u201d he said on the Andreessen Horowitz podcast in June. \u201cBut people don\u2019t really download a lot of apps. You\u2019d always hear that crazy stat that the average iPhone user downloads zero apps per month.\u201dCompanies have realized that users want a more streamlined experience from apps, Frommer said.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of friction into getting them. You have to go into the App Store, you have to search for them, you have to download them, you have to open them, you have to remember to use them,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of bloat.\u201dApple may be looking for a way around those problems. On its website for developers, Apple calls App Clips \u201can opportunity to quickly demonstrate the value of your app.\u201dA look at Apple's new App Clips feature. Apple\u201cUsers will be able to start and finish an experience from your app in seconds,\u201d it says. \u201cAnd when they\u2019re done, you can offer the opportunity to download your full app from the App Store.\u201dUnlike with WeChat, Apple\u2019s feature \u201cbasically lowers the boundary of downloading a mobile app,\u201d said Wang, the Forrester analyst. \u201cIt\u2019s like an entry ticket [to the App Store].\u201d\u2018Race\u2019 to innovationThis is not the first time that Silicon Valley has taken cues from China, said Pocket Sun, founding partner of SoGal Ventures, a venture capital firm that invests in startups in the United States and Asia.Apple, for example, integrated its Apple Pay feature into iMessage well after WeChat popularized the use of digital payments on its messaging app, she said. And TikTok, the short-form video app owned by a Chinese company, has spurred several copycats from American businesses, such as YouTube and Instagram.Even Facebook (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg has suggested that WeChat should be a case study for his company.Last year, when The Information editor-in-chief Jessica Lessin posted an article on Facebook titled, \u201cWhat Facebook Should Learn from WeChat,\u201d Zuckerberg replied: \u201cIf only I\u2019d listened to your advice four years ago \u2026\u201dGeorge Yip, an emeritus professor of marketing and strategy at Imperial College and visiting professor at Northeastern University, predicts that the West is just at \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d when it comes to emulating ideas from China.He said that while some trends have clearly transferred over \u2014 dockless bike-sharing first took off in China before spreading overseas \u2014 \u201cthe surprise is how the West hasn\u2019t woken up to this so much.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of ignorance and resistance,\u201d said Yip, who co-authored the book, \u201cChina\u2019s Next Strategic Advantage: From Imitation to Innovation.\u201dDavid Chao, co-founder and general partner of DCM, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm with $4 billion under management, described the constant iterations as a giant game of \u201ccatch.\u201dOne could argue, for example, over who truly started the short video format \u2014 TikTok or the American video platform Vine, he said. He noted that while Vine was the first app of its kind to gain ground, TikTok and its predecessor, the Chinese app Musical.ly, were clearly the ones to take the concept to another level and become a global sensation. (Chao\u2019s firm was an investor in Musical.ly before it was acquired by ByteDance.)\u201cThere is this catch ball going on. It\u2019s not about one side copying another,\u201d said Chao. \u201cIt just keeps going back and forth, back and forth. To me, that\u2019s the most important part about the interesting innovations that go on.\u201d",

            "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Oscar-nominated 12 Years a Slave actor Chiwetel Ejiofor is to narrate a film about the world\u2019s water shortage crisis, which is funded by an executive from Chinese tech giant Tencent and co-directed by Emmy-winner Kevin Sim.Housed at Keo Films and OoS Pictures, Day Zero is the brainchild of Tencent\u2019s chief exploration officer David Wallerstein, who personally financed the production after becoming fascinated by the status of Earth\u2019s water supplies.Tencent will carry the film in China, while Fremantle has been brought on board to distribute internationally. The company has been shopping Day Zero to buyers during Mipcom.Wallerstein, who is one of Tencent\u2019s earliest executives, became obsessed with researching the water-crisis challenge and wanted to unbury dry scientific information from white papers in an accessible way.\u201cIt started dawning on me that you could make a documentary movie that is scientifically important but also entertaining enough so people could understand these trends on Earth,\u201d Wallerstein said.Wallerstein worked with Keo and OoS to gather footage from around the world over a three-year period, capturing stories from the frontline of the water crisis, such as in Cape Town, South Africa, a city that nearly ran out of water in 2018.The production also examines the impact of deforestation in the Amazon and the catastrophic results of intensive farming in the American Midwest. Along the way, top scientists and experts were interviewed.Sim, who won an International Emmy for Four Hours in My Lai, was brought in after shooting was completed to shape the film and identify the driving force behind its narrative.Theewaterskloof Dam in South Africa Fremantle\u201cIt was a case of selecting from a wider pool of rushes and finding the central characters and the central thrust of the message,\u201d he said. Sim kept coming back to the word \u201curgency.\u201d\u201cThe scientific message is distilled through the experience of people who have turned the tap on and have found no water, or the people trying to find why it is not raining,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe people in our film have firsthand experience of a terrible catastrophe that\u2019s creeping up on everybody, but we live in a world that believes they are crying wolf. We\u2019re trying to do something about it.\u201dHe admitted that coming to Day Zero so late in the process was \u201cunusual,\u201d but Wallerstein has personally shaped the environmental project from its inception.Speaking about Ejiofor\u2019s involvement, Wallerstein said they want the film to reach as wide an audience as possible and there was value in \u201cstar power.\u201d Ejiofor has seen the water crisis through his work with refugees and environmental challenges have inspired his work after he directed The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind.Sim said Day Zero does not pull its punches. \u201cPeople come away from the film feeling quite chastened. \u2026 The future not only looks dry but also looks quite bleak.\u201d He added, however, that audiences will not be left feeling powerless by the film\u2019s message.Virginia Quinn (Africa\u2019s Great Civilizations) co-directed Day Zero with Sim, who also wrote Ejiofor\u2019s script for the documentary. Executive producers are Wallerstein and Kari Lia. Will Pugh was director of photography and Marcy Cox was the producer for Keo Films.",

AIDS came into being only because of college kids like you messing around,\u201d shouted an old man at a group of students who were speaking to people about HIV prevention at China\u2019s West Lake beauty spot. \u201cBehave yourselves! We don't need to listen to your rubbish!\u201dIn 2020, almost three years later, Zhao Honghui, the group leader and a medical student in his third year at Zhejiang University, still remembers every word, but he knew he didn\u2019t do anything wrong. \u201cI wanted to tell the old man that actually new HIV infections among old people are also increasing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that hatred and denial are never the solution to HIV.\u201dRecently, Mr Zhao had the opportunity to say what he had wanted to say and speak about all the experiences, good and bad, he had as a HIV prevention volunteer, speaking to a live online audience of more than 71 000 people from across China.He and five other young HIV volunteers joined an online dialogue on youth and HIV organized by UNAIDS and Tencent, a Chinese technology company, one of a series of youth dialogues organized by the United Nations in China and Tencent to mark International Youth Day and the United Nations\u2019 75th anniversary that enabled Chinese young people to speak their minds about the Sustainable Development Goals.In China, according to government statistics, new HIV infections among young people aged 15\u201324 years have been on the rise over the past few years. By inviting young volunteers to share their stories, the UNAIDS dialogue aimed to raise awareness among young people about the risk of HIV infection, tell them how to protect themselves and other people and encourage more young people to engage in HIV prevention work.Mei Junyan, a second-year student from the South China University of Technology, shared his experience as a peer educator on sexuality education and HIV prevention. Sun Yinghui, from Zhongshan University, told the audience how her medical research team had looked at COVID-19\u2019s impact on people living with HIV and how to help them address the challenges. \u201cI see hope because the dialogue made me realize that I\u2019m not alone in this battle,\u201d said Ms Sun. \u201cIt\u2019s an inspirational dialogue for all of us who are devoted to HIV prevention,\u201d said Mr Mei.They also had good interactions with the guest speakers. UNAIDS China Goodwill Ambassador Huang Xiaoming, an actor, said it was not easy to be a volunteer. The Director of the Chinese Association of STD and AIDS Prevention and Control, Hao Yang, encouraged all the participants to continue what they are doing. He said peer education is complementary with school education and he encouraged students to do more volunteer work.One special guest was Andy Liu (not his real name). He contracted HIV five years ago, when he was 21 years old. Now he has an undetectable viral load after taking and adhering to antiretroviral therapy and has become a volunteer to help other people living with HIV. Unfortunately, however, he felt that had to turn his camera off to hide his identity, as stigma against people living with HIV is still prevalent in China. A touching moment came at the end of the dialogue when Mr Huang told Mr Liu that he hoped that one day he would not be afraid to show his face. He said he believes that day will come soon and he will continue to speak for people living with HIV and to advocate against stigma and discrimination.Mr Zhao hopes the youth dialogue will become an annual event where young HIV volunteers can exchange ideas. \u201cThis dialogue is useful for us to know what other volunteers are doing and to learn from each other. I thank UNAIDS for providing this platform and I hope it can become a regular event,\u201d he said.Amakobe Sande, the UNAIDS Country Director for China, said that UNAIDS is committed to serving young people, together with the Chinese Government and community-based organization partners. \u201cI hope the young people at today\u2019s dialogue will inspire more people to join our efforts too. Together we can achieve an HIV-free generation. We can end AIDS as a public health threat.\u201d",

You can opt-out at any time.AdvertisementSenior officials in the Trump administration are considering restricting the business operations of Chinese firms Ant Group and Tencent in the US over national security concerns, according to a new report from Bloomberg.Ant Group is a digital payment platform founded by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma. Tencent is a Chinese mega-conglomerate and most notably owns WeChat, the popular app that the administration has been attempting to ban alongside TikTok. US leaders are worried that the companies' presence in the US market could lead to the Chinese government accessing user banking data from hundreds of millions of people, according to Bloomberg.A spokesperson for Ant Group told Business Insider in a statement: \"We are unaware of any such discussions within the Administration. Ant Group's business is primarily in China and we are excited about our growth prospects in the China market. Our mission is to contribute to economic growth and job creation through serving ordinary consumers and small businesses.\"Representatives for the White House and Tencent did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.AdvertisementThe report is the latest in a string of attempts by the Trump administration to take aim at Chinese firms. Popular video app TikTok, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, along with the popular Tencent-owned social app WeChat, remain the focus of the president's call to ban apps and services from Chinese companies.Ant Group has become a powerhouse in the digital payments arena \u2014 the firm operates globally, including in the US, but China is its primary market, with 1 billion users in the country. The firm is gearing up \u2014 reportedly this month \u2014 for a monster initial public offering via a dual listing in Shanghai and Hong Kong (it opted to skip over the New York Stock Exchange.) The IPO could catapult the fintech giant past the world's most established financial institutions, like Goldman Sachs.While Tencent may not be a known name in the US, it is one of the world's most valuable companies. The China-based conglomerate has stakes in a slew of companies spanning various industries, from social media apps to gaming to blockbuster movies, including a sizable stake in Epic Games, the firm behind the popular \"Fortnite\" game.Federal judges in late September temporarily blocked Trump's attempts to ban both TikTok and WeChat, but their futures in the US remain uncertain. A hearing is slated for Nov. 4 for a US judge to decide whether or not to allow the administration to ban transactions with TikTok.AdvertisementThe Trump administration also added Chinese telecom giant Huawei to a trade backlist in mid-2019 over national security concerns and banned US firms from selling to the company in May. In August, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced a \"Clean Network\" initiative to crack down on Chinese apps and services.",

The appeal was made to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.The decision to appeal the preliminary injunction blocking the ban escalates the battle over the future of WeChat, owned by the Chinese company Tencent Holdings.

Each ADS would represent four Class A ordinary shares.At the top end of the range, Miniso would be valued at 10.18 billion dolalrs.According to the prospectus information, the company has more than 4,200 stores worldwide, over half of which are located in China.Miniso's plans to go public come on the heels of numerous blockbuster initial public offerings (IPO) this year, including those of Palantir Technologies and Snowflake in recent weeks.A number of Chinese companies, which have debuted in U.S. stock markets this year, have also attracted strong investor interest. Earlier this year, SoftBank-backed KE Holdings, which owns real estate brokerage brand Lianjia, and housing transactions platform Beike, sold over 2 billion dollars worth of shares after its IPO was priced above range.Companies have raised more than 100 billion dollars in U.S. IPOs so far in 2020, comfortably outpacing a 62.5 billion dollars haul for all of 2019, and is on track to be the biggest year since 2000, according to data from Dealogic.Entities affiliated with Tencent would own 4.8 percent of Miniso's stock after the offering, the filing showed.Goldman Sachs and BofA Securities are the underwriters for the offering.(With input from Reuters)",

            "description": "Just as the Chinese duo of Jack Ma and Pony Ma have carved up major chunks of their country\u2019s internet businesses, the battle for control of 1.3 billion Indians\u2019 data could become a two-horse race.The contest would get under way if, as reported by Bloomberg News, Tata Sons Pvt. brings in financial or strategic investors. The holding company of the $113 billion coffee-to-cars conglomerate may be taking a leaf from the playbook of Mukesh Ambani, who has raised $20 billion this year from the likes of Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc., Silver Lake Partners and others for his digital assets. Ambani, India\u2019s richest tycoon, is now parceling out stakes in his retail venture, and may have sought out Amazon.com Inc.The 152-year-old Tata Group is talking to Walmart Inc. for a $25 billion investment in a \u201csuper-app,\" a multipurpose online platform combining fashion, lifestyle and electronics retail, food and grocery, insurance and financial services, as well as digital content and education, the Mint newspaper reported.The advantage is with the 63-year-old Ambani, with roughly 400 million regular subscribers for his 4G telecommunications network. He also has India\u2019s largest retail chain. The kind of super-app that has succeeded in China and Southeast Asia requires a reason for customers to visit it regularly. Commerce is incidental. Jack Ma\u2019s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has its popular Alipay wallet. Pony Ma\u2019s Tencent Holdings Ltd. has WeChat, a messaging service, and WeChat Pay. In Southeast Asia, Grab built a steady user base as a ride-hailing platform before branching into financial services.But if Ambani wants to spawn India\u2019s Tencent, Ratan Tata, 82, can aim to launch its Alibaba. The conglomerate, which owns Tetley tea and Jaguar Land Rover car brands, has its tentacles in more than 100 businesses, all with their supply chains. If Tata can provide a portal to its vendors to sell their wares, host data and discount bills, expansion into business-to-consumer or consumer-to-consumer websites \u2014 like Alibaba\u2019s Tmall or Taobao \u2014 shouldn\u2019t be too hard. Besides, if Walmart comes on board, Tata may get access to both the U.S. retailer\u2019s India e-commerce website Flipkart, which it bought for $16 billion, as well as PhonePe, a payment service.Tata has a stronger pedigree than Ambani in running consumer businesses, though some of its ventures \u2014 like the world\u2019s cheapest car \u2014 have flopped. The group also underestimated the challenge from Ambani\u2019s Jio 4G network and was forced to offload its mobile service business. It\u2019s a 51% partner in a low-cost domestic airline, though India\u2019s aviation minister has said publicly that the unit is close to shutting shop. To prevent that, Ratan Tata may also have to buy out Malaysian entrepreneur Tony Fernandes\u2019s AirAsia Group Bhd., the 49% partner. Aviation will require further investment if Tata acquires taxpayer-supported Air India Ltd., which a cash-strapped government is desperate to sell. The Tata Group was the carrier\u2019s original owner before it was nationalized.Ambani brought in outside equity to cut his flagship Reliance Industries Ltd.\u2019s net debt to zero and lower its dependence on refining and petrochemicals, businesses that will struggle with global oversupply in the post-Covid demand funk. Tata has a net debt overhang of more than $20 billion in steel and automotive businesses. In addition, Ratan Tata needs billions of dollars to buy out the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, an 18.4% shareholder in the holding company. Ever since the group patriarch ousted SP Group scion Cyrus Mistry as Tata Sons chairman four years ago, the two sides have been trapped in a messy legal feud. Now that SP\u2019s liquidity crunch is forcing it to cash out, Tata must exercise its right of first refusal or bring in other investors, perhaps by tapping the group\u2019s deep connections with Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and its state investment firm.So far, the Tata Group has held itself together by the glue of its software export business, which churns out cash without requiring much investment. However, with clients moving to cloud-hosted services, helping global companies maintain large applications on in-house servers is getting stale. Tighter U.S. visa restrictions will further shrink the scope for arbitraging the labor of cheap Indian code-writers. The Tata Group badly needs a new growth engine, and could find one in data.But it needs to hurry up. Alphabet\u2019s Google aims to build a cheap Android phone for Jio. Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp messaging could handle payments for JioMart, a network of neighborhood shops virtually connected to Jio subscribers. If Amazon does end up backing Ambani, and Walmart throws in with Tata, then corporate America would have broadly finished placing its bets on what could be the next big emerging-market online commerce story after China.India certainly has scope for two super-apps. Since a majority of users will be accessing data on $50 smartphones with limited storage, any more than that may not be viable. All the more reason for Tata to make its moves quickly.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andy Mukherjee is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies and financial services.

            "description": "Kalle Heikkinen is the Chief Game Analyst (China) at Finnish mobile game analysis outfit GameRefinery.The past year has been an interesting time for the mobile games market in China, especially as the global COVID pandemic has impacted how people are playing games.We\u2019ve conducted a year-on-year revenue analysis of iOS games in the Chinese mobile games market between Q2 2019 and Q2 2020 to see what the most significant changes have been.Looking at the market from the perspective of market share, revenues and mobile game design we\u2019ve analysed what the most significant markets shifts were as well as which game categories, genres or publishers best capitalised on this market opportunity.We\u2019ve also taken a look at the different mobile game sub-genres to see if any of them have seen significant changes in their momentum.Here\u2019s what we found.China Market Overview - SubgenresThe biggest loser in terms of quarterly revenue share across all subgenres in the China iOS market was MMORPG.It dropped over eight per cent during the year, accounting for 23.5 per cent of all game revenues. This is still a very respectable number, but the drop translates to almost $108 million, leaving the MMORPG subgenre at over $452 million in revenue in Q2 2020.Other subgenres that took a hit include AR and Platformer, both primarily supported by single titles (Let\u2019s Hunt Monsters and Ninja Must Die 3).On the positive side, these were good times for other Mid-Core genres such as 4X Strategy (Game of War-like city builders) and Battle Royale as well as MOBAs and Idle RPGs.The growth of the 4X Strategy subgenre can mostly be attributed to Lingxi Games\u2019 \u201cRomance of the Three Kingdoms \u2013 Strategic version\u201d (\u4e09\u56fd\u5fd7\u00b7\u6218\u7565\u7248), which has been a big hit since late 2019. The growth of Battle Royale is almost entirely caused by the continued success of Tencent\u2019s PUBG Mobile, while the big leap in the Idle RPG genre is mostly thanks to Lilith Games\u2019 AFK Arena.An interesting phenomenon we\u2019ve noticed is the growth of the Poker/Cards subgenre, which has previously been marginal in China. Poker/Cards grew in terms of market share and revenues from 1.6 percent and $28 million to 2.2 percent and $43 million. This growth can likely be linked to real-life mahjong parties being banned in some parts of China due to the pandemic.Top PublishersDuring Q2 2019, Tencent held 49.6 per cent of the Chinese iOS game market revenue. A year later, Tencent\u2019s share of the market\u2019s revenue had dropped to 39.3 per cent, meaning a decrease of over $125 million in quarterly revenue in Q2 2020.Tencent\u2019s market share has reduced by 10 per cent, making it the only top 10 market share publisher not seeing revenue growth.During the same period, Tencent\u2019s old rival and biggest competitor NetEase, also saw a slight decrease in its share of game revenue in the Chinese iOS market, falling from 17.8 per cent to 16.8 per cent. However, there was no drop in quarterly revenue value. On the contrary, NetEase\u2019s quarterly revenue in Q2 2020 saw a slight increase of almost $7.5 million compared to the year before.This change in the standing of both giants (Tencent and NetEase) can likely be explained with the influx of new publishers that have been able to grab their share of the Chinese iOS market.The number one grower of these studios was Alibaba Group\u2019s Lingxi Games, which grew from a tiny 0.4 per cent market share in Q2 of 2019 to a notable 6.6 per cent in Q2 of 2020.This translates into a growth of over $121 million in quarterly revenue compared to a year before. In second place was Lilith Games Shanghai, which saw its market share grow from zero to 2.9 per cent, or $55 million in quarterly revenue, all thanks to its hit game AFK Arena.ConclusionFrom our analysis of the Chinese iOS market from Q2 2019 to Q2 2020, we can conclude the following:The MMORPG subgenre endured a significant loss in terms of market share and revenues.Respectively, other Mid-Core subgenres were able to increase their market share, including 4X Strategy, Idle RPG and Battle Royale games.Poker/Cards excellent performance is an interesting phenomenon likely due to the pandemic.Tencent suffered a notable hit to its market share and revenues.Lingxi Games was one of the major publishers to grow in market share with games such as Sanguozhi.Lilith Shanghai was also able to scale up its market share from 0 to 2.9 per cent thanks to AFK Arena\u2019s launch in China.(Note: All data in this post is based on IAP revenues from iOS China top 500 games. \u201cRev\u201d indicating revenue in Q2 2020, \u201cMS\u201d indicating Revenue Market Share in Q2 2020, \u201cchange\u201d indicating the YoY difference between Q2 2020 and Q2 2019.

There is emerging evidence that they also have a debilitating influence on rights outside the country.ByteDance\u2019s products catering to Chinese users\u2014including news aggregator Jinri Toutiao, search engine Toutiao Search, and Douyin, the domestic version of TikTok\u2014all censor what the Chinese government considers \u201cpolitically sensitive\u201d content. Articles that mention the names of top People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) leaders, for example, or videos uploaded by Uighurs to draw attention to their missing family members are quickly removed. The company also censored content it considered critical of the PRC government on its news aggregator app in Indonesia from 2018 to mid-2020.Through Douyin, ByteDance worked closely with the PRC police to disseminate state propaganda whitewashing Beijing\u2019s abuses in Xinjiang. ByteDance also signed an agreement with the Ministry of Public Security to promote \u201cthe influence and credibility\u201d of police departments nationwide.Similarly, WeChat censors and surveils users on the PRC government\u2019s behalf and hands over user data to authorities when \u201csensitive\u201d information is discovered. There have been numerous reports about people getting harassed, detained, or imprisoned for their private messages on WeChat. A man in Shandong province was sentenced to 10 months in prison for sending a single video clip referencing an anti-government campaign to a U.S.-based friend. Uighurs and Tibetans have been imprisoned for using WeChat to share religious materials. A study by Citizen Lab in Canada showed that WeChat also surveils its users outside the PRC to build up the database it uses to censor PRC-registered accounts.ByteDance and Tencent may have enriched many people\u2019s lives by facilitating expression, but their very success became possible at least in part because they actively assist the PRC government\u2019s suppression of speech.Last year, the U.S. government sanctioned dozens of Chinese tech companies for their role in human rights violations in China. All governments grappling with Beijing\u2019s increasingly global tech-enabled censorship and surveillance need to develop legitimate, necessary, and transparent responses that take into account how the human rights of all users\u2014not just their own citizens\u2014are impacted.Ensuring that Chinese tech companies are held accountable for facilitating human rights violations while not creating a race to the bottom and not endangering the future of an open, interoperable global Internet is a delicate matter. But there are solutions with fewer potential negative effects: The U.S. and other governments should provide alternate channels of communication and invest in open-source technologies that enable people in the PRC to more easily circumvent censorship so that they do not get trapped in the black hole of Chinese companies\u2019 censorship and surveillance. Domestically, those governments need to strengthen their own data protection laws so the privacy of users can be protected from the abusive practices of all companies, Chinese or others.",

Rival e-commerce firms Alibaba and JD.com have also sought to return to equity markets closer home by making secondary listings in Hong Kong.The offer price represents a premium of 56.5% to Sogou's close on July 24, the last trading day before Tencent offered to take it private.Controlling stakeholder Sohu.com Inc said it would receive about $1.18 billion in cash from Tencent as part of the deal, sending its shares up about 14% in premarket trading.Tencent currently owns a 39.2% stake in Sogou, according to a letter it sent to Sogou shareholders in July.Sogou, which was founded in 2005 and debuted on the U.S. market in November 2017, generates revenue mainly through search advertising services.Goldman Sachs( Asia) is acting as financial adviser to Tencent on the deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2020.Reporting by Ayanti Bera in Bengaluru; Editing by Ramakrishnan M.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

Located at the edge of Zhonguancun Software Park, north of Central Beijing, the building can accommodate thousands of employees and visitors in its seven-storey complex.Tencent Beijing Headquarters located at the edge of Zhonguancun Software Park in Central Beijing Image: \u00a9 Ossip van Duivenbode, Courtesy of OMAThe Netherlands-based architectural firm designed the Tencent Beijing Headquarters as a 'city' in a singular building. \u201cThe campus allows for unique manipulations not possible within the limits of typical traditional offices and neither effective in a dispersed urban setting,\u201d mention the architects.The building as seen from the street Image: \u00a9 Ossip van Duivenbode, Courtesy of OMASpanning 180 metres in length and width, this city is divided into nine quadrants, each with its own core that functions independently. On the outside, pathways interspersed with green lawns connect the quadrants while on the inside a web of streets facilitates this link.A closer view of the facade Image: \u00a9 Ossip van Duivenbode, Courtesy of OMAThe interiors of the building, which has not been photographed as yet, has been designed by OMA in collaboration with Australian firm Woods Bagot. Each floor encapsulates a layer of hierarchy where spaces are distinctly organised and programmed under functions of work, education, and play.Entrance to the building Image: \u00a9 Ossip van Duivenbode, Courtesy of OMATo ensure that the dense volume receives ample daylight and ventilation into the interiors, three triangular prism-shaped openings are cut through the centre of the campus. At the edge of the building, the floor plate steps down to give form to a sunken ring that doubles as an informal public space.Prism-shaped openings let natural light and ventilation into the building Image: \u00a9 Ossip van Duivenbode, Courtesy of OMADetails of the ornamental facade Image: \u00a9 Ossip van Duivenbode, Courtesy of OMALandscape at the roof level Image: \u00a9 Ossip van Duivenbode, Courtesy of OMAAt the roof level, the top floor is receded from the building\u2019s edge to give shape to an expansive green space that overlooks the panoramic views of the city.Programmatic diagram Image: Courtesy of OMAAs per the architects, to offset the inertness of the square volume, the corners of the building are chopped off to define imposing entrances into the complex. On the rest of the fa\u00e7ade, geometric insets punctuate the glass fa\u00e7ade that reveal a sharp, sculpturesque form that stands out in the Beijing skyline.The project is one of the many works of the Dutch firm from China which includes Prince Plaza in Shenzhen, CCTV Headquarters in Beijing, and the upcoming CMG Qianhai Headquarters in Shenzhen.",
